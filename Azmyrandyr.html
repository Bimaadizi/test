<p>Azmyrandyr of the Twelve Talons , was a Red Wizard of Thay in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was a gaunt man.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He took poorly to being laughed at.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was known to possess a wild magic stone and a magical ring through which he sent messages.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He could cast meteor swarm and also magic missile .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was part of a strange cycle-teleporting effect that allowed him to trade locations with fellow Red Wizard Roeblen , but in return, he was bound to do the same whenever called on by an especially large umber hulk , with little warning time. This cycle had been forced upon him as part of his participation in an extensive cabal; linked into the same cycle were Auvrarn Labraster and Thaltar Glaervar .</p>
<p>Rilder Palengerrast , Orth and Burgel were three of his four weakest apprentices.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Azmyrandyr answered a call from an umber hulk , who employed a teleporting link to swap himself out of a fight against Alustriel Silverhand and thus escape from Silverymoon , where it'd been summoned by the merchant Auvrarn Labraster, whom Alustriel believed to be hiding information regarding a murder. He did not get much time to prepare, but brought a wild magic stone .</p>
<p>He turned the room into a riven wreckage with a modified meteor swarm spell, and used the stone to break Alustriel's antimagic field , then swapped out for Roeblen the moment he took a hit.</p>
<p>Later, the Simbul targetted him for killing at first light one morning he'd been pulling an all-nighter with his four weakest apprentices, preparing them for impersonating notables in Nimpeth . She quickly cut off all exits, and struck his apprentices with a fusillade of magic missiles , which instantly killed two of them. Having no other spells prepared than magic missile , which she proved immune to after his apprentice Orth hurled some at her, he instead resorted to calling for aid through an enchanted ring. She responded by rendering him into a boneless puddle by her casting of Simbul's skeletal deliquescence , and then cleaved apart by his apprentice Rilder's spectral axe .</p>
