<p>Dahl Peredur was an antiquarian and Harper apprentice. He was formerly a novice Oghman paladin but he fell from grace for reasons he didn't understand.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Dahl was fairly skilled at ritual magic . He was also well educated, which was to be expected from a follower of Oghma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a young man, Dahl studied to be an Oghman paladin. For reasons unclear to Dahl, Oghma revoked his powers and Dahl was kicked out of his order. Dahl moved to Waterdeep and at some point began working for the Harpers, tracking down antiquities and magical items of interest.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dark Circle, 1478 DR , Dahl was assigned to hunt for antiquities with Tam Zawad , a fellow Harper. While looking around Waterdeep, the pair heard about a page from a magical Netherese tome for sale by a merchant. They were unable to buy the page, but Tam, Dahl and companions stole the page from the mansion of the wealthy caravan master who purchased it.</p>
<p>With the help of Tam's daughter, Mira , they were able to locate the lost library of Tarchamus the Unyielding , which they explored, finding Tarchamus' magic tome the page belonged to. In the process, they destroyed the library and the undead inside.</p>
