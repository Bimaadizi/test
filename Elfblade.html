<p>The Elfblades were three specific magical swords created with Elven High Magic by spellcasters from the Elven Court in −4000 DR . The three swords—the Rulers' Blade (the Ar'Cor'Kerym ), and the two Defenders' Blades, the Warblade (the Ary'Velahr'Kerym ), and the Artblade (the Ary'Faern'Kerym ) —were wielded by the rulers of Cormanthyr and used to determine who was worthy of such responsibility in the ancient ritual of blade-rite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −4000 DR, Coronal Oacenth of Jhyrennstar fell ill, and his fever proved incurable. As a prophet of Labelas Enoreth , he spoke the famous words that would prove to one day unite the elves under the great Kingdom of Cormanthyr:</p>
<p>At the Coronal's wish, young clansmen worked to prove their mettle, from which three candidates emerged, and these candidates were given the newly forged Elfblades to mark their rulership. It should be noted that a priest of each Seldarine god was necessary to create the blades. As Kahvoerm Irithyl drew the Rulers' Blade , he became ruler of Semberholme , Jhyrennstar, and Elven Court, which later became Cormanthyr.</p>
<p>The three blades were each used to erect one of the towers in Castle Cormanthor , creating the permanent domiciles of the rules in the Rule Tower, the War Tower, and the Art Tower.</p>
<h2>Common Characteristics</h2>
<p>While each Elfblade was unique, they shared common characteristics among the three of them.</p>
