<p>A trick door was a magic door that would open to nothing but a wall unless the correct code-knocks were made before opening the door.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Trick doors only opened the way through if, before being opened, the user correctly did the specific doors code-knocks. If done incorrectly it would just open into a wall mimicking the surrounding wall where the door was installed.</p>
<p>It was speculated that a spell similar to passwall were used in their creation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Time of Troubles , these doors were known to have been installed in the thieves' guilds of Mulmaster , Hillsfar , Calaunt , and Tantras . Several guilds placed additional false doors around the trick doors in order to further confuse unwelcomed intruders.</p>
