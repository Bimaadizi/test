<p>Healing was a type of giant rune that gave casters another way to create potions of healing .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Whenever any liquid was first poured into an inscribed drinking vessel the healing rune would cause it transmute into a potion of healing . If the rune was improperly inscribed than the liquid would instead transmute into a deadly poison . If this rune was extensively studied a second time, the caster would instead create a potion of extra-healing or an even deadlier form of poison respectively.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the liquid had transmuted into it, it would revert to its previous state within an hour.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a drinking vessel such as a cup, goblet, or bottle.</p>
