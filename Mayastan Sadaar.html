<p>Mayastan Sadaar was a dragonborn sage that lived in the library-fortress of Candlekeep during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Mayastan uncovered the book entitled The Canopic Being within Candlekeep and grew greatly troubled. She was insistent on traveling to the far-off city of Tashluta and learning more from the oracle of the House of the All-Seeing Orb , Valin Sarnaster . In fact, Mayastan sought to confront the oracle and prevent her from completing out the series of rituals outlined in the book.</p>
<p>One of Candlekeep's Great Readers , A'lai Aivenmore , became concerned at Mayastan's sudden shift in focus and set a group of adventurers to follow her to Tashluta.</p>
<p>Upon her arrival, Mayastan was received by the servants of Valin Sarnaster and taken into her inner sanctum . Mayastan's pancreas was forcibly removed and replaced with that of Valin Sarnaster, as part of the ritual that would transform the dragonborn sage into one of the oracle's canopic golems . Realizing the fate that awaited her after the transplant, Mayastan chose to end her own life and not allow Sarnaster to gain strength at the expense of her own body.</p>
