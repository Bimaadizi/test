<p>The House of Tezca was a large desert found in south of Nexal on the continent of Maztica . It was named after Tezca , the Maztican god of the sun and heat.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The House of Tezca was a bleak, barren land of sand and stone. In it could be found Sunstone and Tewahca , the City of the Gods. After Qotal 's return and the flight of many refugees from Nexal, Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line down the middle of the desert, and a larger lake near the center of the desert itself, inside a fertile valley. It was by that lake that Nexalans built a new city, Tukan .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The House of Tezca was inhabited only by desert dwarves , who lived in small villages cut directly into canyon walls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the distant past, Tewahca was built, including the massive pyramid upon which Zaltec and Qotal fought their legendary battle.</p>
<p>At some point, during the reign of Chalco, the Nexalan Empire sent an army across the northern part of the House of Tezca to conquer Kolan . Later, in the year 1362 DR , Qotal caused a series of oases to spring up in a line along the middle of the desert, and a lake in a fertile valley in the center of the desert. Here the Nexala people established Tukan.</p>
