<p>Kortolt Rushtyn was a priest of Ilmater from the city of Mussum in the Vilhon Reach , who preached near Hlondeth in the early 1340s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kortolt Rushtyn was a young underpriest at the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum, circa 1342 DR , when he received visions from the god Ilmater directing him to the hidden Tome of Torment , the most holy book of the faith . However, rather than take it back to Mussum or its traditional home of the House of the Broken God in Keltar , Kortolt took it to Raven's Rack , an isolated shrine to the god west of Hlondeth, on Tanarspear Hill . Here, Kortolt made use of the Tome to aid both believers and non-believers, and to preach about Ilmater. The people of Hlondeth came to see Kortolt as a gift from the gods, one who kept them safe and well when they were sick or injured.</p>
<p>However, in winter of the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , Kortolt was killed by bandits. They attempted to sell the Tome in Hlondeth, only to be killed themselves by a mob angry at the death of the much-loved priest. The people presented the Tome to the Graycloak's Wolves adventuring company, to take to Master Sufferer Olbedan in Aralent .</p>
