<p>Ropers were ambush hunters that evolved in the underworld. They were favored by the drow god Ghaunadaur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They took the appearance of stalagmites and would wait for a living creature to draw close.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When this happened, the roper quickly lashed out with tendrils extruded from its body that wrapped around its target, sapping the creature's strength. The roper then drew its prey into its fang-filled mouth to consume. As a roper never knew when its next meal was coming, it often slew and ate more than it could possibly consume at once.</p>
