<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Adrik and his brother mostly traveled together. He had had a childhood love who died from a disease.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Adrik became an adventurer after his childhood love, Chelsea , died from a disease.</p>
<p>He formed part of a caravan's guard in winter of 1375 DR , on the path from Telflamm to Emmech . While part of that caravan, he helped repel a Red Wizard patrol.</p>
<p>After the caravan reached Emmech , he took a commission with Raidon Kane , a half-elf monk and his fellow guard in the caravan. Though he did not have much gold, the monk had enough to afford one brother alone for two tendays; Adrik was also interested in visiting the Yuirwood. His brother Erik remained in Emmech, looking for a ship to take the two brothers across the Sea of Fallen Stars. In Relkath's Foot , Adrik tried the rootweal wine, and found himself passed out not long after.</p>
<p>Adrik and Raidon joined the force in Relkath's foot going into the offensive against Stardeep. Even though the force was defeated, the two of them lingered. He later joined Kiril Duskmourn , hoping to visit Sildëyuir. In Sildëyuir, Adrik took in the vistas eagerly.</p>
<p>When they came across Moonveil Citadel, they were attacked by a summoned fire elemental and its nilshai masters. He was poisoned; Kiril took them to visit the Edgewarden in order to find healing. Unfortunately, the edgewarden could only slow the poison down, not stop it. While they sought entry into Stardeep through its Underdungeon , Adrik was disabled, being too weak to fight back effectively against the revived fossils they found. He died of his wounds not long after. He was buried at Callambea in the Underdungeon, together with the dead of a company of Empyrean Knights .</p>
