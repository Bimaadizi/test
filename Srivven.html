<p>Srivven was a mage and, along with Iraun , one of the self-proclaimed kings of Adaerglast around 1374 DR .</p>
<p>They originally came from easternmost Murghôm after a battle broke out in their school of magic between students and their masters. Before arriving in Adaerglast, Srivven and Iraun traveled Faerûn plundering mages' tombs and seizing spells from living wizards. Srivven has no actual right to rule over Adaerglast, although he and Iraun believed that the gods had appointed them this task. They had resisted several attacks and, due to the strong magic in Adaerglast, had protected themselves by setting up many very powerful spellwebs .</p>
