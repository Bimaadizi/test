<h2>History</h2>
<p>New Harvest Punch was one of the highlights of the annual New Harvest Festival, alongside its famous Harvest Stew . The grand gnomish feast was turned into a disaster in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Purfbin Doogrick and his Shred-o-Matic 1000 wrecked chaos on the gnomish festival attendees. Bald Dame Edza , whose prized wig was destroyed in the calamity, dived headfirst into a sizable bowl of New Harvest Punch to avoid the rampaging machinery.</p>
