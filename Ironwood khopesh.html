<p>The ironwood khopesh was an unusual khopesh held by the medusa Sshaastess in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The long curved blade was extremely heavy and made from a kind of petrified wood . It was as strong and sharp as anything made from adamantine , and emitted a soft purple glow.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The khopesh was reinforced with a magical field that made it more resilient as well as added a small blast of arcane energy to every strike. Appropriately enough for a medusa's petrified wood blade, it was able to turn flesh to stone on a successful strike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sshaastess kept the khopesh in her stash of looted items when she took over the home of Seamus in Lost Souls' Swamp , alongside other treasures like a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll .</p>
