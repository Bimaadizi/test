<p>Captain Samuel Turgat was the captain of the Flyingfish ship from Daggerford , active circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Samuel Turgat was a somewhat lanky middle-aged human male with dark medium-length hair and a fine mustache that framed his thin mouth.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Captain Turgat was considered the nicest marine vessel captain in Daggerford. Samuel spoke with a thick and put-on pirate dialect, rolling his r's and abusing the words of the trade. However, that was nothing but a show he seldom dropped, thinking that this dialect was expected from a man of his profession. When faced with non-sailors, Turgat felt comfortable enough to speak in his regular eloquent and educated manner.</p>
<p>Unlike many sea-faring folks, Turgat preferred reading to blackout drinking and could often be found doing just that in his cabin.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Trulit & Greegon's claret‎‎ was one of the goods that Turgat's vessel traded in.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Samuel Turgat was an alias of a man who used to work at the Sorceller's Encapsulate , a mage library and guild of Daggerford. There the young man read through nearly every book, eventually coming across the book named Turgat's Revene , a work of fiction. That adventure novel told the story of Captain Samuel Turgat and his sidekick Doctor Algernon. Enamored with dreams of adventures on the high sea, "Samuel" purchased a boat he called Flyingfish using his sizable inheritance and legally changed his name to that of the fictional pirate. He hired a crew of "scurvy scallywags" and set to build his new life.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, Captain Turgat was forced to dock in Daggerford after his ship suffered some damage in a fierce gale. The captain let his crew get drunk on their shore leave as he supervised the repairs. When Samuel Turgat met the Hero of Daggerford , he welcomed the opportunity to speak without the pirate jargon that tired him out. He informed the adventurer about a suspicious frigate docked next to the Flyingfish , the Barracuda . The ship had exclusively been loaded up under cover of darkness from suspicious barges that traveled up the Delimbiyr River .</p>
