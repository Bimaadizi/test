<p>Battrick Degronce was an inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Battrick was a rock gnome with a light skin tone, receding blonde hair, and dark brown eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Battrick Degronce's complaints of foul odors attracted the attention of Fist Jimi Borleas . The gnome stated that the area around Philgrave's Mansion stank of rot and decay, and the smell was coming from the mansion itself, with strange miscreants creeping around at night. Battrick was adamant that the mansion was not safe. However, Fist Borleas dismissed such claims, stating that the stench was coming from the sewers and that he would file a report asking for the eventual sewer cleanup. The response left Battrick convinced that the Flaming Fists did not care about the Lower City and its inhabitants. In reality, Battrick was correct in his suspicions – the stench was coming from the mansion – the lair of Mystic Carrion and his undead servants, with the manse's upper floors being filled with decaying viscera and cadavers.</p>
