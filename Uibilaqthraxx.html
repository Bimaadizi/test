<p>Uibilaqthraxx , also called the True Tongue by beholders , was an ancient and disused language that influenced the modern Quevquel language of beholders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Uibilaqthraxx was one of several older beholder languages that fell into disuse. Much of Quevquel was derived from Uibilaqthraxx directly or indirectly, with lengthy and ornate True Tongue words shortened into their much quicker Speech forms.</p>
<p>The name of the beholder cult Daeth Haeromm was transliterated directly from Uibilaqthraxx, with the meaning of "Wise Gatherers."</p>
