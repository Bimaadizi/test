<p>The Chultan pantheon referred to the small number of deities worshiped by the humans of Chult .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the distant past of Faerûn , the deity Savras had a vision that when the doom of Abeir-Toril arrived, Dendar would come to Faerûn through a portal beneath the Peaks of Flame ; whether Dendar would be the cause of that doom or merely a symptom of the cause was unclear even to the greater deities . And as the deities debated amongst themselves how best to prepare for the fulfillment of the All-Seeing One's prophecy, Ubtao, who stood aloof from the squabbling of the other pantheons, stepped forward and volunteered to stand guard, but in exchange for exclusive dominion over the lands surrounding his post. The other deities agreed, and so Ubtao went to dwell in Chult.</p>
<p>There, Ubtao made a great, lush jungle and populated it with humans and dinosaurs . He dwelt bodily there in Mezro for a time, until the nagging of his followers caused him to return to the Outer Planes. However, the act of creating the jungle had somehow distanced him from the mortals who inhabited it, and in order to reconnect he imbued a portion of his being into Chult itself: the land, the rivers, the plants, and animals... but in doing so, a part of his essence split off from him to become Eshowdow . Eshowbow's birth heralded the end of strict monotheism amongst the humans of Chult, and some thought that it might herald the emergence of a whole pantheon of deities arising from Ubtao's fractured essence.</p>
<p>The only other deity who could be called a member of the Chultan pantheon was Sseth , an interloper and snake-god who had managed to establish his cult amongst some of the humans.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Other pantheons were worshiped by non-humans in Chult without complaint from Ubtao. The goblinoid pantheon had long been worshiped by their people who lived in the region, and the wild dwarves worshiped Thard Harr .</p>
