<p>Dhairn was a drow judicator of Selvetarm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dhairn was part of a group of drow exiled from Eryndlyn for worshiping Selvetarm as a deity on its own instead of a servant of Lolth .</p>
<p>In 1375 DR , Dhairn went to recruit a large group of driders living in the Underdark under the Misty Forest for membership in the Selvetargtlin .</p>
<p>Later, when various groups of Underdark monsters, including chitine , neogi , driders , and spellgaunts attacked all of Eilistraee 's shrines on the surface, Dhairn led the main force of Selvertargltlin to attack the Promenade of the Dark Maiden . He killed Iljrene , dissolving her body into a writhing mass of spiders and fought well against Qilué Veladorn .</p>
<p>However, at last, in the Demonweb Pits , Cavatina Xarann killed Selvetarm himself. Dhairn fell confused and powerless without the power of his god. He was trying to escape when Qilue's blade skewered his back.</p>
