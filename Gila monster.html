<p>Gila monsters were a species of venomous and slow-moving lizard that could be found in the Plain of Standing Stones . They were counted among the most dangerous lizards that could be encountered in that region of the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These small lizards had large heads with powerful jaws and around thirty-five grooved teeth. Their bodies measured 2​ to ​3 inches (5.1​ to ​7.6 centimeters) in length, with diminutive legs and short, stout tails. The scales of a gila monster were brightly colored and rough in texture, almost bead-like, forming gaudy patterns that never overlapped. They were noted by some as resembling muckdwellers , though moving in a quadrupedal manner instead of bipedally.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Gila monsters generally had shy dispositions and wouldn't attack humanoids unless they were provoked.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These lizards had a sack of venom within their mouths that flowed down their teeth when biting down on prey. This venom would inflict extreme pain upon a victim, followed by sweating, vomiting, swelling, and an unbearable ringing sound within the ears. These symptoms would gradually worsen until the victim fell to their death.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When engaging other creatures in combat, gila monsters fought by clamping down with their powerful jaws and administering lethal doses of their venom.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Gila monsters lived solitary, nocturnal lives. They took shelter beneath rocks and within small burrows that they took over from other creatures.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Gila monsters had a largely carnivorous diet, consisting of small mammals, birds, and eggs . They could go without eating for a period of months, subsisting solely upon stores of fat within their tails.</p>
