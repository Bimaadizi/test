<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Approximately 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the base of the Spire , the town was located in a forest of abnormally large flora.

The Seven were spirits known to possess bodies of mortals for years or decades at a time in order to take a physical form, with most hosts volunteering themselves for the position. They were each known by a title that reflected their natures: Action, Knowledge, Pain, Passion, Reflection, Rest, and Thought.</p>
