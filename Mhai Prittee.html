<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , young Mhai the Mage spent his entire life within the city walls of Hillsfar. Without ever venturing outside, Mhai often dreamt of what he thought the farm life outside was like: dwarven maidens with parted beards, churning milk into butter with their hairy feet amidst a pastoral countryside setting. One night, such great changed into a strange vision of two feminine arms luring him towards a woman's face for a kiss and then towards a magic shop Mhai recognized as the establishment always holding a "Going Out of Business Sale."</p>
<p>Mhai discussed the vision with his aged wide frog familiar. Obviously, the vision commanded the mage to break into the magic shop under a cover for the night. They theorized that there was something important in the show, or maybe the vision was a command from the Mages' Guild of Hillsfar, of which Mhai was a member of. The young mage thought it to be his big break, an opportunity to abandon his life of sleeping in Hillsfar's stables. Despite his history of being captured by the Red Plumes while trespassing in the past and being sent to the Hillsfar Arena and receiving a whooping from Lefty the orc , Mhai decided to risk it.</p>
<p>Mhai entered the shop via one of his knock rings and quickly began to search for whatever the "Arm and Lip Lady" from his vision wanted. Eventually, Mhai discovered an item he'd never seen before – a faintly-glowing pick , carved with ornate designs and inscribed with its name – Stonemaster . Still unclear on the vision's purpose, the mage and his familiar decided that the pick needed to be returned to its master, as it was obviously out of place in a wizard's miscellany store. Mhai thought that it belonged to the master of a rock quarry west of Hillsfar.</p>
<p>The young mage was terrified of the wilderness outside of town – all the lions , tigers , and bears . On his way across the town back to the stables, Mhai was confronted by Wak Rathar , who appeared out of nowhere on the Market Street . The old wizard offered to show the youth a magic trick, but Mhai declined as he once before fell for the man's trick and ended up fighting Lefty in the Arena. As the sun began to rise, Mhai tracked down the stable master – Darnin , and convinced him to land the youth a horse for the journey to the quarry west of Hillsfar, past a roadside trading post. Mhai decided to stop at the trading post along the way to gather information. There, he purchased a map of the quarry that managed to only show its approximate location, past the hermit's place.</p>
<p>Mhai did stop at the hermit's hut, but to his annoyance, the old man took a vow of silence and offered no help apart from his maniacal humming. The mage and his familiar proceeded to move through the woods for the next hour and finally reached the quarry, swarming with dwarven and human miners. The quarry master was an extremely irate dwarf who, indeed, was the owner of the Stonemaster . A woman named Diane promised the dwarf that someone would be bringing the pick soon and left an elixir to give to the young mage as a reward. Mhai decided to show the mysterious bottle to the guildmaster of the Hillsfar Mages' Guild.</p>
<p>By dusk of the same day, Mhai was back in Hillsfar and at the stables. The next day, Mhai woke up close to midday to Dodo's mockery and amusement. The mage fantasized about serving his familiar's legs as an entree at Ruby Slippers Pub , but begrudgingly, they headed out for the Mages' Guild. Mhai was invited to meet with Glinda , the guild's Master of Mages. He announced that the potion given to Mhai was the elixir of Diane , believed to had been lost. Without hesitation, Glinda uncorked the vial that started spewing red vapors. The person who emerged from the bottle was the "Arm and Lip Lady," whom Mhai recognized from his vision. She introduced herself as the daughter of Diane. She was trapped, asked for help, and before fading away, she left cryptic directions for the young mage: "The first honor is of exacting aim on the fourth board," and whispered another word, "Tanna."</p>
<p>Tanna's Archery Range was the next stop on Mhai's strange journey. The range offered those not proficient with ranged weapons, like Mhai, magic wands to shoot the targets with. After a long session of hitting targets and scoring well across four scoreboards, Mhai's task was completed. Tanna handed the mage his winnings and, in secrecy, told him that Diane was sending him on the next part of the quest – to the Wizard's Labyrinth outside of Hillsfar, where more elixirs of Diane were hidden. The journey continued on the back of another of Damin's horses.</p>
<p>Using another one of his knock rings , Mhai gained entrance to the Wizard's Labyrinth. After several hours of searching about the hallways and headends, the mage found a vial of the reddish potion, another vial of the elixir of Diane . Another potion was uncorked, and red mist showed the daughter of Dianne once again, and once again, she left Mhai with a puzzle: "The second honor is one of freeing the Mages' Tower from a malevolent spirit. You need to open a special chest within the room it inhabits."</p>
<p>Mhai was set to finish the quest, even if it meant angering a malevolent spirit; the reward was a position in the guild. The Mages' Tower was an abandoned structure in Hillsfar. Inside, Mhai was assaulted with the feeling of palpable evil. Soon after entering, the mage began the search for the chest, pursued by the spirit. At the very moment, Mhai opened the chest, he was grasped by the spirit was ready for his cold grave, but in a blast of brilliant light, a goodly spirit rose from the chest and repelled the young mage's doom. It uttered, "You are honored this day with the second honor of Diane," and disappeared, leaving an elixir of Diane behind. The last and final message for the young mage was, "The last honor, my daring mage, is one of defeating the proud minotaur , Taurus , in the Arena. He is the instigator of my imprisonment."</p>
<p>The next day Mhai rose full of determination to finish his strange quest and defeat the bovine gladiator of the Hillsfar Arena. Somehow, Mhai felt deep and unreasonable hate for Taurus as he rushed to the Arena. With a simple challenge, the mage attracted the minotaur's attention. And within moments, their battle began with the bullman's charge. Mhai showed unparalleled skill with a quarterstaff , and with little aid from Dodo, Taurus was defeated. As the crowds cheered, a woman dressed in some of the best finery approached the mage. She was Diane, and all of the trials were her doing. She guided the hero to defeat Taurus, who sometime earlier trapped Diane's daughter within a mirror of life trapping with its location inscribed in magical script on a piece of parchment . Mhai read the script with ease – the mirror was in the infamous haunted mansion in Hillsfar's southeastern end.</p>
<p>Finding the mirror was an easy task; Mahi found it in the first chest he came across. With the mirror of life trapping smashed, Diane's daughter was freed at last. His reward was a hug from a beautiful young woman whose name he never learned. Lady Diane did leave a kind word with the Mages' Guild. Glinda, the Master of Mages, thanked the wizard youth and awarded him a sack of 21,500 gold pieces from Lady Diane. The reward from Glinda was magic from the ring of wishes that made Mhai sturdier, stronger, and able to withstand more damage.</p>
<p>The strange adventure ended with Mhai using the earnings to purchase one of Damin's horses, Magesteed, and galloping away to Tilverton .</p>
