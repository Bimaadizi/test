<p>Chameleon leather armor was a type of armor used on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The name "chameleon leather" was a misnomer, as it was actually made from the treated hide of an ophidian , not the skin of a chameleon . The breastplate and shoulders of the armor were stiffened by boiling in oil. The rest of the armor remained tough, but flexible. The armor did maintain a fraction of the color-changing abilities that the ophidian once possessed. Chamelon leather could only be crafted by a master leatherworker.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Chameleon armor was only commonly found in communities near the Serpent Hills . Any serpentfolk who encountered non-serpentfolk wearing chameleon leather would treat the wearers with disdain or hostility.</p>
