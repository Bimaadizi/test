<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Defender of Easthaven was created circa the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , following the defeat of the devil Belhifet , who returned to the Ten Towns with vengeance, after being banished from the Realms by the hero named Jerrod . The magic weapon was intended to remain in Easthaven as a symbol and a reminder to the northern folk of the time the town was almost destroyed.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Defender of Easthaven , along with several other magic items from Icewind Dale, ended up in the hands of the merchant named Joluv who traveled from Icewind Dale to the City of Coin, Athkatla , to sell the items to wealthy Amnian adventurers. Joluv peddled his wares from the Copper Coronet in Athkatla's River District .</p>
