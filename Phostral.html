<p>Phostral was a warrior in the Frostfire Banner adventuring party during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was immense, but had a fitting set of armor and a sword.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phostral was a member of the Frostfire Banner when they took on High Duke Horostos 's assignment to search for the reason why all animals larger than one's hand, as well as most people, were vanishing on the road between Starmantle and Ripplestones .</p>
<p>They were ambushed on their first night out of Starmantle by a chiming mist, the Slayer , which killed most of the party. He woke up when Paeregur called everyone awake; only he and Lhaerand were still alive at that point. Seeing the mist, Phostral tried to parry, but the entity swung into him, and reduced him to dust inside his armor.</p>
