<p>The illithidae were an order of creatures that were from the same alien world as the illithids . They were related to illithids much the way mammals such as apes or wolves were related to humans . Various species of illithidae were known to live in and around illithid lairs and cities, though whether on purpose (as domesticated creatures) or by happenstance (simply drawn to the same places) was unknown.</p>
<p>Like the mind flayers they were lesser kin to, the various species of illithidae typically had four limbs with four digits each (when terrestrial), an arrangement of four tentacles around a beaked mouth, and tough, slime-covered skin. Moreover, they all went through a larval stage in which the larvae dwelt and grew within some creature killed by the parent. They disliked light, and most exhibited some amount of psionic powers.</p>
<h2>Cessarid</h2>
<p>Cessarids were sometimes compared to canines, in that they were quadrupedal predators that traveled in packs. However, they had an large head and eyes, with a large rending beak surrounded by four short tentacles. The skin was smooth, grey, and slimy, and short spines stuck out of the back. The space between the toes was webbed. Although of average intelligence, they acted as little more than animals.</p>
<p>Cessarids' tentacles were coated in a poison that induced a stinging and burning sensation to the touch, and they could use the psionic abilities body equilibrium , ESP , and dimension door . Additionally, they could telepathically communicate with other cessarids within 24 ft (7.3 m) of themself with ease. They were wily and cruel; when they were not hungry cessarids were known to harass and torment prey for hours before killing it.</p>
<p>Cessarids reproduced by depositing 1-3 larvae in a corpse, which the adults then guarded until they metamorphosed. For unknown reasons, cessarids seemed to favor intelligent victims as hosts. Cessarid packs did not cooperate with each unless pressed by other creatures; they would fight kaoulgrim ("dogs" bred by the githyanki) on sight regardless of restraints or magic, and szarkel ("dogs" bred by the githzerai) always avoided cessarids without fail.</p>
<h2>Embrac</h2>
<p>Embracs were large illithidae, slow ambush predators with sack-like bodies some 10 ft (3 m) long, with 8 20‑foot-long (6.1‑meter) tentacles sprouting from its body; each tentacle tapered down to an end split in three. The limbs were short and stout, the beak was large and saw-edged, and the skin was striped and/or spotted black, grey, white, and/or dull red, and there were bone plates just beneath the skin.</p>
<p>The slime on the tentacles was poisonous, and embracs were also recorded to be capable of psionics including: concussion blast , empathy , ESP , invisibility mind bar , crushing despair , deep slumber , sound burst , and displacement . Some were also reported to be capable of illusions akin to a non-dangerous spectral force .</p>
<p>Embracs were solely ambush predators, though they would rarely make use of items taken from prey or bargain such items with other creatures. They had also been seen as servitors in illithid cities. Embracs reproduced in a similar manner to cessarids. Despite being of only low intelligence, embracs held all other creatures in low regard.</p>
<h2>Kigrid</h2>
<p>Kigrids were another type of quadrupedal predator, though somewhat stockier than a cessarid, with black skin and dull red eyes. They had sharp claws and four tough, spiky tentacles. Kigrids were cunning, malicous, and constantly hungry. They lived either alone or in small packs, though only of kigrids closely related to each other, for larger ones had no problem eating smaller ones. Like embracs, kigrids' tentacles were coated in poison.</p>
<p>Kigrids had limited psionic ability, capable of blink , daze monster , detect thoughts , ESP , body equilibrium , levitation , and invisibility . Additionally, they could understand most languages thanks to some unknwon psionic skill and, though they did not speak, they were perfect mimics. Kigrids were sometimes used by illithids as beasts of burden.</p>
<h2>Saltor</h2>
<p>Saltors were scavengers that ate anything they could catch. They were said to vaguely resemble baboons, or perhaps even be akin to illithids as baboons were to humans, with three-fingered hands with opposable thumbs, and skin that was generally white or black but occasionally red, grey, or violet in color. Saltors were sometimes classified into two types: the more typical argid and the larger and longer-limbed jendrids, which were faster on the ground than argid but not so good at climbing.</p>
<p>Saltors were of limited intelligence and psionic talent, known to use blur , magic missile , and haste . They sometimes used crude weapons or tools. Illithids bred enslaved saltors, for the creatures were unfailing obedient to their masters. Saltors were bold in numbers.</p>
