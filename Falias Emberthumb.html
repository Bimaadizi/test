<p>Falias Emberthumb was a halfling merchant who sold mundane goods, cloth, and dresses from Waterdeep in the city of Daggerford circa 1372 DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Falias Emberthumb was a portly halfling with a bold head, crow-like nose, dandy grommet mustache, and a small beard.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a nervous fellow who often sweated profusely when stressed, wrangling his hands. He was very polite and proper, and bowed according to customs even when interacting with his own employees.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Falias Emberthumb's regular caravan consisted of three wagons drawn by six oxen .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , Falias Emberthumb hired mercenaries to accompany his caravan from Waterdeep to Daggerford, a shipment of ladies' gowns. One of the hirelings was an experienced fighter , Talarenne , and the other would later become the hero of Daggerford, and another. They traveled along the Trade Way until the caravan was stopped by a recently fallen tree. This was a scene of an ambush by a group of mysterious bandits (in reality, Zhentarim agents). As the attackers were defeated, Falias assumed the attacks be simple foolish robbers who foolishly attacked a shipment of clothes.</p>
<p>Reaching the safety of Daggerford's walls, Falias made sure his surviving injured guard received the best care. The halfling merchant felt honor-bound to offer the hero of Daggerford one of his best dresses as a reward for the job well done, and opened up a stall in the city's marketplace, not far from the Daggerford Castle .</p>
