<h3>Faerlthann's Keep</h3>
<p>Faerlthann's Keep was the original stone tower on the hillside in Suzail and the historical seat of power in Cormyr . It was named after Faerlthann Obarskyr , the first king of Cormyr. It was built up from the original house that stood on the spot. During the reign of Boldovar the Mad , the windows of the keep were turned into barred slits.</p>

<h3>Attack by Thauglor</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , Thauglor , a huge black dragon , attacked the castle and demolished around a quarter of it, setting fire to the remaining structure and causing extensive damage. Thauglor withdrew before the military could launch a response to his attack.</p>
