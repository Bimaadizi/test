<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kardeera was a good-looking mountain of a woman with a jovial personality, beloved by all. Kardeera loomed over the troublemakers when a brawl was imminent, peacefully dissuading them from starting a brawl. She was an immensely powerful woman who could defend her tavern by hurling tables and patrons with ease; however, she much preferred to joke and chat. She was a capable swordswoman but used her knuckles in a brawl. She fought dirtily and cunningly, using her tavern and the surrounding environment against troublemakers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite her intimidating exterior, Kardeera Alaekynjack was a hopeless romantic who dreamed about being swept off her feet by a bigger and more muscular knight with a heart of gold and a hidden tender streak. Several adventurers tried their luck at courting Kardeera, but none has been successful as the late 14 th century DR.</p>
