<p>A sword of wounding was an enchanted blade that caused additional physical harm to a target.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These blades were available for every type of sword .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Any harm inflicted by a sword of wounding could not be healed by regenerative or magical powers. They could only be healed by natural means. Wounds suffered from these weapons caused additional harm in the form of bleeding that would continue until properly treated. This was a cumulative effect, so someone struck several times would bleed out at a faster rate.</p>
