<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of a set of bracers of artifice received a magical defense identical to that of a set of full plate armor but with no drawbacks. The bracers only weighed a fraction of plate mail's weight and imposed no restrictions on the wearer's gesticulations, making them perfect defensive items for mages . In addition to protection, bracers of artifice boosted the wearer's focus, allowing sorcerers to collect arcane energies more effectively and wizards to memorize an additional spell from the 8 th circle of magic per day. Lastly, bracers of artifice granted the wearer minor resistance to magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , bracers of artifice could be found on the wrists of Red Wizards of Thay at the Academy of Shapers and Binders .</p>
