<p>Darts of homing were enchanted projectile weapons capable of returning to the wielder's hand when thrown.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic enchanting these weapons made them more likely to strike true and cause more physical harm upon doing so. Upon successfully striking the intended target, a dart of homing would instantly return to the wielder's hand and could be thrown again without hesitation. However, if one of these darts missed their intended target then their enchantment was lost.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Donar Heremet , a thief inhabiting the city of Waterdeep , carried a dagger of homing .</p>
