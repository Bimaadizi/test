<p>Savengriff (pronounced SAY-ven-griff) was an apprentice wizard of Khelben Arunsun before he helped to refound the Covenant .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Savengriff was described as a gaunt man with pale skin and an unremarkable face. He possessed dark brown hair, a beard, and hazel eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Savengriff was loyal to Khelben and was always prepared to be attacked.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Savengriff was regarded as the weakest member of the Company of Crazed Venturers but he was personally recruited by Khelben to be a member of that band in the hopes of grooming him for the Harpers . At one point, he and fellow Venturer Tzarrakyn were both killed in a fight with a beholder . Savengriff's body was left in the beholder's lair but Khelben used a necklace he had gifted to him to discover the body's location, then led a sortie into the lair with Durnan , Mirt , Kitten , Piergeiron , Shalar Simgulphin , and several of Khelben's mage apprentices to retrieve it, killing the beholder as well. Khelben asked some cleric allies to bring Savengriff back from the dead, which earned him Savengriff's loyalty.</p>
<p>Savengriff became Khelben's apprentice and a member of the Harpers under Khelben's sponsorship. As a Harper agent, he was wide-ranging in his duties, traveling all over the North on Harper business. As time went on, Savengriff spent a good deal of his free time devising ways of avoiding fearsome beasts, like the beholder that had slain him, as well as means of avoiding death. These efforts led him to develop the wand of banishment , also known as a staff of banishment .</p>
<p>Eventually, some time after having created over a dozen wands of banishment , Savengriff started wandering the planes where he met Grimwald and Presper , formerly of the Covenant . He discussed with them the reformation of that organization and in 1372 DR , he returned to Waterdeep and set their plans into motion, based out of his room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger . Although he still had friends in the Harpers and Moonstars , he ceased working for either. Instead, he began the process of recruiting wizards to join his resurgent Covenant.</p>
<p>Savengriff and his wife Aleena Paladinstar were prolific writers. In 1479 DR , Renaer Neverember possessed their entire collection of their mundane works, which included the following books by Savengriff:</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Savengriff was the creator of around a dozen staves of banishment . Although he made gifts of ten of them to fellow Harpers, including one to his master Khelben, he kept one for himself and was rumored to have hidden one away somewhere.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Savengriff married Aleena Paladinstar .</p>
