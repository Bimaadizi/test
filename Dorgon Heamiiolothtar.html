<p>Dorgon "Stonecloak" Haemiiolothtar was the magister of Mystra during the 2 nd and 3 rd centuries DR , having enjoyed the longest tenure since the mortal Azuth . He served this post from the Year of the Troublesome Vixen, 177 DR to the Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dorgon was kind man with a peaceful disposition who, when necessary, was capable of acts of ruthlessness and unforgiving retaliation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dorgon ascended as Magister following the death of his friend and former-master Malanthus Stormstaern , who had died after being struck by a "falling star" that, may or may not, have been a malfunctioning spelljammer .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , Dorgon defended himself from a group of magelords who sought to challenge his authority.</p>
<p>When the old wizard was too weak to continue his service to the Goddess of Magic, he sought out the most unscrupulous mage from among his contemporaries, Sirdan Aulauger of Shussel and assaulted him. Both men perished in the ensuing spell -battle.</p>
<p>The office of magister was then offered by Azuth to Faerndel of Mourktar , who refused the Lord of Spells. Nelorth Broamshoulder accepted the tile thereafter, and succeeded Dorgon as the personal champion of Mystra.</p>
