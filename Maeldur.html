<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Maeldur was temple master at a certain Thayvian temple of Shar where the Red Wizard Azmyrandyr was quartered at the time. The Red Wizard was targetted for elimination by the Simbul in response to an attack on Silverymoon on which he participated. After she slew Azmyrandyr and all his apprentices, she proceeded to slay all nearby Red Wizards and the temple staff; Temple Master Maeldur called on his underling Staenyn to rouse two visitors, one of which he deemed mightier than Azmyrandyr.</p>
<p>Maeldur cast a few protections on his warriors and then a blade barrier , which the Simbul hijacked with a spellsnaring sphere . Finally, she used his spell to slay him.</p>
