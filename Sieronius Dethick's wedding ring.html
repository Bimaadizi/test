<p>This enchanted wedding band was affixed to the cursed vampire Sieronius Dethick 's pale desiccated finger. Several centuries before 1372 DR , Sieronius was a living drow agent of the Church of Vhaeraun . This ring was the physical representation of the marital bond he shared with his beloved wife. Eventually, Sieronius was trapped deep in the tomb underneath what later came to be known as Liam's Hold by Sunder Halyndliam and forcefully turned into a blood-sucking creature. Sieronius Dethick remained confined to the dungeon, unable to escape for centuries with only the wedding ring remaining to remind him of his wife, who was sure to have been dead for many years by the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>I 1372 DR, Sieronius attempted to escape the cursed confinement by forcefully marrying another woman. Even though Sieronius Dethick's wedding ring's fate remained unclear, it was either still on the vampire's finger as he left Liam's Hold, or taken of the slain creature's desiccated finger by the Hero of Daggerford .</p>
