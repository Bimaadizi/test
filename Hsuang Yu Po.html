<p>Hsuang Yu Po was a noble and general of Shou Lung in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hsuang was a noble and a general in the province of Chukei . There, he raised alone his daughter Hsuang Yu Wu , who inherited most of his qualities.</p>
<p>Around Shou Year 2598 (1348 DR) , Wu fell in love with Batu Min Ho , a soldier of Tuigan ancestry in Hsuang's private army. Hsuang opposed the marriage, hoping for a more suitable man for the daughter of a noble. Hsuang said that he would agree only when Batu became a general in Shou Lung. This was supposed to be a joke but Batu joined the Shou army and rose through the ranks, becoming one of the youngest generals of Shou Lung. Impressed, Hsuang agreed to the marriage and developed a true respect for the military abilities of his son-in-law.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2609 (1359 DR) , when Emperor Kai Tsao Shou Chin and the Minister of State Ju-Hai Chou asked Hsuang's opinion if Batu would be the right man to defeat the Tuigan Horde invasion, he guaranteed he was.</p>
<p>When Batu was put in charge of the campaign against the Tuigan, Hsuang was chosen to lead the personal armies of the nobles, the Twenty-Five Armies .</p>
<p>Batu and Hsuang devised a secret plan to defeat the Tuigan near the city of Shu Kuan . However, during the fighting, the rebellious tendencies of General Kei Bot Li and two other generals permitted the Tuigan to totally destroy the Twenty-Five Armies. Hsuang was killed and his head put at the entrance of the tent of Yamun Khahan , which Batu later saw when he went to discuss with the Tuigan spokesman Koja .</p>
