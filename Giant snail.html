<p>Giant snails were extremely large versions of the typical garden variety snail .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Much like the common snail, these creatures were quite slow and plodding in their movements.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures could see in areas of low illumination to total darkness . Much like the common snail, they could be harmed by salt , though owing to their size it took contact with 1 pound (450 grams) or more of salt to do serious harm.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These mollusks typically retreated into their hard shells when threatened. When forced to fight back, a giant snail would simply slam its body against its aggressor.</p>
<h2>Notable Giant Snails</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were known to be found naturally in the Feywild , the Great Bhaerynden region of the Underdark , and the swamp of Shibinuma on the island of Shinkoku .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Some creatures in the Feywild, like Agdon Longscarf and his band of harengon brigands, forced giant snails into service as pack animals.</p>
<p>The Witchlight Carnival kept a number of giant snails for the purposes of racing. Having their own dedicated, 480‑foot (150‑meter) circular racecourse, the racing of giant snails proved to be a highly competitive and crowd-pleasing attraction for the carnival. These snails were notably faster than the average giant snail. Each competitor was outfitted with colored caparisons and a numbered saddle strapped to their shell.</p>
<p>On an unknown world, the shells of enormous snails were harvested for the creation of nautiloids .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On one famed occasion the Company of the Cleaver delved into the depths of Undermountain , the grand dungeon underneath Waterdeep , and through some series of events their adventure concluded with the members of the group riding a giant silvery snail along the streets of the city's Castle Ward .</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The caves of Daerndar , in the Grand Duchy of Shantal of the Border Kingdoms , often produced outbursts of wild magic effects whenever magical discharges occurred within them. One such effect that could occur was a baleful polymorph , which had a high likelihood of turning a nearby being into a giant snail.</p>
