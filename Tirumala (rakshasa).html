<p>Tirumala was a rakshasa who founded the city of Tirumala in the Beastlands and ruled as its rajah through the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tirumala constructed their eponymous city upon the ruins of an old Durpari settlement, and declared it to be a holy site. Within the city, Tirumala required that all slaves be naked in public so that any weapons or tools they carried could be seen at a glance.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , one of Tirumala's servants was a fellow rakshasa named Devang , who had become a trusted vizier to the rajah of Estagund and helped to push Tirumala's interests.</p>
