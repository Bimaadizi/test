<p>Vaporighu were a race of foul creatures native to Gehenna and the Dismal Caverns</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A vaporighu was a hideous, bloated, waddling blob of slimy hairy flesh, vaguely humanoid in shape. Their skin had the color, and foul smell, of gangrenous rot and dripped with a poisonous slime. Tangled matted fur hung from their bodies, and a pair of small horns protruded from their heads. The skin underneath the fur were a mottled pink/purple mass with visible veins of pulsing bile. their breath came and went in great wheezing gurgles, with and occasional explosion of mucus. They reeked of all the decay and sulphurous stench that encapsulated Gehenna, and would linger for days after the vaporighu had passed through the area.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>All vaporighu were petty, sadistic and voracious, driven by an eternal gnawing hunger they could never satiate. They seemed to perform no other function in the ecosystem of Gehenna, other than to waylay creatures unfortunate enough encounter them, larva and lesser fiend alike. They would pick out hiding places near portals or the rare watering holes and wait for victims to approach, attacking anything less than a greater yugoloth . While they spoke both Abyssal and Infernal , they rarely if ever communicated with others, even their own kind. Whether they disliked each other or just respected their individual hunting grounds no-one can say, but no two vaporighus were ever seen together.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vaporighu were tenacious combatants, fighting without any subtlety or art, and to the death. They radiated a powerful aura of fear and horror that could overwhelm even the strongest of opponents, making their foes either flee, or better yet become paralyzed with terror. While they rarely bothered to try to run down fleeing opponents, they delighted in attacking those too terrified to move. They would strike out with their hands, covered in their natural secretions, that would be left behind on a victim. This slime would eat away armor and clothing, and within a few hours turn even the finest armor into pitted rags not worth wearing. They themselves were near immune to damage, only wounded by weapons made from cold iron , even the finest enchanted weapon did no damage unless it was made from that material, and even then the enchantments would do nothing, only the cold iron itself causing any damage.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some rumors abounded that the vaporighu was once a type of yugoloths that forgot how to leave the plane of Gehenna.</p>
