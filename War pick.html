<p>War picks , also known as military picks , were a type of pickaxe designed specifically for warfare.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>War picks generally consisted of one or two curved, heavy piercing flukes mounted upon a shaft. Some shafts were known to be spiked at the end. These thick curved flukes, also known as "crow's beaks," help to balance the war pick's hammer head.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>All war picks were designed to pierce through heavier armor types, from chain mail all the way up to full plate armor . However, they could get stuck if swung too hard. Some training was required to wield them effectively, thus they were often considered martial weapons.</p>
<p>Despite having a similar appearance, war picks were noted as being ineffective tools for climbing compared to ice axes .</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<h3>Footman's pick</h3>
<p>Footman's picks were the larger and heavier variety of war pick. Their name derived from the fact that they were most often wielded by infantry soldiers. They generally were 5 feet (1.5 meters) long.</p>
<h3>Horseman's pick</h3>
<p>Horseman's picks were the lighter variety of war pick, their name derived from the fact that they were most often wielded by mounted knights and heavy mercenary horsemen. They imparted less force than a footman's pick, but their smaller size allowed wielders to fight with greater speed and agility. They generally were 2 feet (0.61 meters) long.</p>
