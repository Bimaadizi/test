<p>Dwenthor of the Winds was a wizard from Cormyr who returned to serving along the Wizards of War sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR, a middle-aged wizard Dwenthor of the Winds courted Xanda Pennywell , a seamstress from the hamlet of Liam's Hold . Dwenthor, a worldly and aged man, made a home in a small stone cottage in the pastures close to the hamlet. Xanda ended up being swayed by the older man and fell in love with him. As a gift, the wizard enchanted a cape for his beloved, to protect her from harsh Sword Coast winters. However, the man was a coward and a deserter. The romance was abruptly cut short when a group of Cormyrean mercenaries came looking for Dwenthor and returned him to his service among the War Wizards. Dwenthor never returned to Xanda, and, eventually, she married another man, keeping Dwenthor's cape of bravery as an item to sell in case she ever needed coin.</p>
