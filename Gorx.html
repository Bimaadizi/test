<p>Gorx was a xorn at the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil during the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , while in his home plane , Gorx saw a gate to Toril . Intrigued, he passed through and arrived in the Fane. There, Keltar , a member of the Cult of the Black Earth , mistook Gorx for an emissary of the elemental lord Ogrémoch . Taking advantage of this, the xorn enslaved the cultist, saying that Ogrémoch needed tributes to be given to Gorx. However, some adventurers infiltrated the Fane and confronted him.</p>
