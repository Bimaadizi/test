<p>Queen Saraala Ithal was the first queen of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Saraala was the eldest daughter of the chieftain of Clan Tarseth of the so-called "barbarian" clans of Tethyr, but her mother was an elf , the daughter of Selanlar of the Tethir tribe, who was allied with the humans against Calimshan . This made Saraala a half-elf .</p>
<p>Saraala fell in love with and married the new king of Tethyr Darrom Ithal of Clan Ithal , becoming the country's first queen.</p>
<p>Darrom and Saraala had two sons and a daughter. The first son was named after his father; the second son was named Silvam .</p>
<p>Her brother, Amir Tarseth I , became chieftain of Clan Tarseth after her father.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Saraala married King Darrom in the Year of Bound Branches, −211 DR . Since Saraala was a member of both Clan Tarseth and tribe Tethir, the union helped maintain the unity of the fledgling country.</p>
<p>Saraala bore three children in the first four years of their marriage: first Darrom II, then Silvam in −209 DR , and finally a daughter in −207 DR . Sadly, little Darrom died from a fever in −206 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of Stonerising, −200 DR , Clan Bormul finished construction of a palace for the royal family, Ithalyr , located on the coast in the Purple Hills region. The queen moved with the rest of the court from Ithmong to this new location.</p>
<p>In the month of Eleasis of the Year of Larks, −183 DR , her own brother, Chieftain Amir I, became so angry with a decision made by her husband to pacify the elves of the Forest of Tethir that he orchestrated the murder of her husband by teleporting a deepspawn into his throne room.</p>
<p>In −170 DR , during the reign of her son Silvam, Saraala was strongly opposed to his decision to appoint his cousin's wife Zahyra Bardson-Ithal as Tethyr's first court vizera.</p>
