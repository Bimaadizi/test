<p>Deep Ale , also referred to as Fire Ale , was a popular Waterdhavian frothy alcoholic drink reinforced, or "warmed" with grain-based liquor.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>In Waterdeep , Westgate , Beregost , and many other places up and down the Sword Coast , taverns sold pre-mixed "warmed" drinks or mixed and served them to-order. "Warming" drinks was a common practice of adding various stronger liquors, usually grain-based, to a drink. That practice was born out of the commonly watered down drinks served in the taverns of the Coast. The spirits used to "warm" drinks most commonly were clear distilled potato alcoholic drinks of no color or taste.</p>
