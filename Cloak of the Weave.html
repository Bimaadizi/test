<p>The cloak of the Weave was a magical , protective cloak that allowed the wearer to absorb and harness elemental energy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Twice per day, the cloak of the Weave could be used to absorb elemental energy and partially negate any harm they suffered from its effect. That energy was then redirected to the wearer's own powers, and allowed them to inflict a portion of that energy against foes during any next attack they made.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cloak granted the wearer inherent protection against magical spells and their effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the cloak remained in the possession of Helsik , the diabolist trader who operated the Devil's Fee arcana shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate .</p>
