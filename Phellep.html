<p>Phellep was a self-proclaimed prophet who followed the philosophical teachings of providential rejection, who lived long before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phellep preached the philosophical belief that no person's actions had any consequences on humanity, rejecting concepts of good and evil. To apply his beliefs, Phellep created a powerful enchanted weapon he called Inconsequence . The hammer was used to enforce indifference and "encourage" political, social, and moral abstinence. Phellep used Inconsequence to break down the doors of "the dens of fools and mindless men," more commonly known as churches and temples. Phellep likely died some years before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , as Inconsequence left his side.</p>
