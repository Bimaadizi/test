<p>Speed was a weapon quality that, when applied to a weapon, allowed the user to strike at a heightened pace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wielder of such a weapon could strike more quickly than usual, and as such, it allowed them the time to cause an additional hit. However, if already under the effect of a spell that increased the amount of times they could strike, such as haste , the wielder would not have an additional attack on top of that.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A spellcaster needed the haste spell to create a weapon with this ability.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Some veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of speed .</p>
