<p>The Oracle of Nasmen , also called the Sumbar Oracle , was a mysterious being found on the island of Sumbar in the Pirate Isles in 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The oracle appeared as a large well atop a ridge.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Oracle of Nasmen would answer a single question provided a proper offering was made. Though the Oracle's answer was often confusing, it was never known to lie once the entire prophecy was understood at a later date. A querent would toss the proposed offering down the well. It appeared that offerings of higher value yielded answers with more clarity and accuracy. A voice would rise from the depths of the well with the answer to the question. Answers were often given in the form of riddles or poetry.</p>
<p>Interacting with the Oracle was not without its risks. There was a chance that, after receiving an answer to their question, a querent would then enact events to bring about their own demise.</p>
