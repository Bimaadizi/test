<p>A belt of stone giant strength , also known as a girdle of stone giant strength , was a magical belt that granted an individual tremendous physical might.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These belts were rather plain-looking in appearance made of thick leather and metal studs. They were considered amongst the less powerful variations of belts of giant strength .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The belt or girdle would imbue the wearer with the strength, though neither size nor girth, of a stone giant . Furthermore some belts and girdles also allowed the wearer to throw rocks and bend metal bars as if they had imbibed a potion of giant strength of the stone giant variety, such that one could throw a 198 lb (89.8 kg) rock for 16 yd (15 m).</p>
