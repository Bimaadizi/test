<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Feg was an albino , its most notable feature was its leathery bat -like wings, that made Feg unique among other winged monkeys.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

The magic enchantment of the monkey allowed its master to send the creature out as his spy and see through its eyes, similar to a wizard 's familiar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kaverin Ebonhand purchased Feg from a wizard in Tantras .</p>
<p>In 1362 DR , Feg accompanied its master on board of the Narwhal , the vessel of Captain Bawr , from Baldur's Gate to Chult , in search of the Ring of Winter . The flying monkey served as an invaluable asset in the sweltering heat of the jungle as it constantly fanned its master.</p>
<p>As Kaverin Ebonhand ventured into the jungle, trying o locate the artifact ahead of his nemesis, an ex- Harper adventurer Artus Cimber , the villain stroke a shaky alliance with Chultan Batiri goblins and their beautiful queen M'bobo . The partnership came at a price, however. Kaverin Ebonhand gave his provisions up for the goblins' service and gifted Feg to the queen, to Feg's utter disgust. Ebonhand still reserved the right to use his albino monkey as a spy in the quest for the Ring .</p>
<p>Soon after, Feg was sent to be Kaverin's eyes, spying on Artus Cimber and his activities in the hidden city of Mezro . The flying monkey was caught and instantly slain by Neyobu , a guardian panther of Ras T'fima , one of Mezro's Bara . Feg's body was used for Ras T'fima's witch doctor magic. He used quartz crystals to track Feb's connection back to its master, allowing Artus to track the villain.</p>
