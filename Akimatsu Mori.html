<p>Akimatsu Mori was the semi-mythical first human Emperor of Kozakura , whose ascent marked the first year in the Kozakuran Calendar and the founding of the Akimatsu Dynasty .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Prior to becoming the first Emperor of Kozakura, Mori led the Akimatsu tribe as their chief, in ancestral lands that were later known as Shizume Province . In ancient Shou Lung texts, he was referred to as a lesser barbarian prince.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Kozakuran legends, the islands of Kozakura were once ruled by the Earth Spirit emperors, demigod offspring of the Eight Million Gods and mortal humans . They supposedly received such titles from the Heavenly Deities, but were more likely dubbed emperors by the rulers of later eras so as to legitimize their own rule. As the Earth Spirit emperors continued to breed with humans over the course of this era, their bloodline lost its might and almost disappeared completely. Strife arose among the varied human tribes of Shinkoku , who warred amongst themselves and the korobokuru over territory. The Kozakurans, still honoring their gods, beseeched intervention and for them to take sides.</p>
<p>Over the course of many years a descendant of the last Earth Spirit emperor, Akimatsu Mori, would garner influence and the support of several tribes through conquest and diplomacy. The latter largely revolved around strategic marriages between Akimatsu women and the nobles of other powerful clans, then making moves to ensure that the children of those marriages would end up assuming control of the other clans. Eventually, recognizing his claim to the throne of Shinkoku, the Eight Million Gods answered the prayers of their people and selected Mori to lead the Kozakurans.</p>
<p>When Mori and his tribe presented their claims of divinely given authority to the other tribes, the gods supported his right to the title with several displays of divine power. Mori's ascent to power in Kozakuran Year 1 (−73 DR) would mark the beginning of recorded history in Kozakura. In the widely used Dalereckoning calendar of Faerûn , this was the Year of Swift Courtships, −73 DR , whilst Shou Lung marked it as Shou Year 1177 (−73 DR) . Mori would settle his court and government in the ancestral lands of the Akimatsu tribe, in a settlement that became known as Fukama .</p>
<h3>The Reward of Tomy</h3>
<p>One legend surrounding Emperor Mori's early reign, immortalized in a stylized noh play called The Reward of Tomy , told of an incident in which he nearly died from an improperly prepared fugu . The story goes that he was visiting the inn Nami No Hana to celebrate his recent victory in the Battle of Kyoki . He was presented with the inn's specialty, a dish of raw tiger fugu and daikon that had been sculpted into the image of a flying crane . However, the inn's master chef saw this as an opportunity to avenge his brother, a man who had died fighting against Mori in the Battle of Kyoki. The chef saw fit to poison the Emperor by chopping up the fugu's toxic liver, then mixing it into the radish sauce that was to be used in sculpting the crane's crest.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Tomy , a young apprentice chef descended from generations of master chefs, noticed something peculiar about the dish Nami No Hana's master chef had prepared and recklessly chased after it. Shoving past Mori's imperial guards, he barely managed to grab the Emperor's hand just moments before a strip of fugu, generously coated in the poisoned sauce, could reach his lips.</p>
<p>Emperor Mori felt compelled to recognize Tomy's courage and show his gratitude by making the man a daimyo . As for the head chef that nearly cost him his life, the Emperor had him sit as a guest of honor at his table and personally fed the man his own poisonous cooking.</p>
<p>Whilst openly grateful for the Emperor's kindness, Tomy turned down his offer on grounds that ennobling him would dishonor the memory of the countless master chefs in his family. He preferred instead to continue his studies and one day realize the dream of the Sumitomo founder, that of a descendant one day owning their own kitchen. The Emperor in turn would come to the realization that Kozakura would be better off with more chefs and fewer daimyos. So whilst Tomy worked away at finishing his apprenticeship, he issued an imperial decree to have two roads built in the young man's home province of Maeshi and at their junction had an inn constructed from expensive material, that of stone, rather than the more common building material of wood.</p>
<p>On the day that Tomy finished his apprenticeship, a company of imperial troops under orders of the Emperor apprehended him and escorted the chef to that inn. When the man stood in awe of the edifice and wondered where the inn's keeper was, the captain of the troops handed him a ring of keys and informed him that it was a gift from Emperor Mori. Moreover, along with the keys came an imperial writ of protection, one that would stand long after the first Emperor passed away, making it a crime punishable by death to violate the hospitality of the inn or harm its owners. To commemorate the event that brought this all about, Tomy would name the inn Doi No Fugu , meaning "Inn of the Globefish" in the Kozakuran tongue .</p>
<p>At some point, Emperor Mori was said to have journeyed to Doi No Fugu, on the anniversary of the Battle of Kyoki, just to visit with Sumitomo Tomy and partake of the dish that nearly cost him his life.</p>
