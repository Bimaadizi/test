<p>A Heward's handy haversack was a magic backpack that offered three compartments of extradimensional storage space.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The haversack looked like an ordinary backpack and always weighed 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) regardless of its contents.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The backpack contained two side pouches that could hold up to 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms) at a maximum volume of 2 cubic feet (56.6 l) each, as well as a main compartment capable of storing up to 80 pounds (36 kilograms) at a maximum volume of 8 cubic feet (226 l). If overloaded or damaged, the haversack was destroyed, its contents lost forever.</p>
<p>As with many other magic storage objects such as bags of holding or portable holes , placing a Heward's handy haversack inside the extradimensional space created by one of such items destroyed both and opened a temporary portal into the Astral Plane that pulled through it any creature within 10 ft (3 m) of it.</p>
