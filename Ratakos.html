<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Ratakos was ambushed by the vampires Moria and Ryanna at the Journey's Rest inn. He used his powers over the undead to hold them at his mercy, and they quickly negotiated a much better deal. While he pretended to be a customer at the inn, he created undead that would harass travelers on the road nearby and cause them to stay the night at the inn. The vampires then feasted and killed the victims, supplying him with their fresh corpses.</p>
<p>When the vampire's plan eventually went awry, Ratakos stay uninvolved and unconcerned, and moved on to new ventures.</p>
<p>He later found himself working for Lord Vorik Aris at Wyvernwatch Castle , helping to manage his undead cohort.

He participated in the battle at Darkenshield and was not particularly impressed by the legion of murderous ghosts raised against Lord Aris, though he eventually fled when the tide turned against him.</p>
