<p>Dymondheart was the Nentyarch 's sword. On 1373 DR , he bestowed it upon the Nentyar huntress Elowen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dymondheart was a sword made of a single block of gleaming wood. It appeared as if darkly oiled, with the wooden grain running with the length of the blade. When it was swung, the air whistled as it parted. The grip was solid and warm to the touch, and sunlight hitting the blade scattered off as if it were metal. Its life force was perceptible.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The sword's edge was hard to dull. Its touch was anathema to twig blights. Against some demons, the blade strobed green, causing their hide to erupt in green flame by simply brushing them. Against greater demons, their skin peeled itself back on contact. The blade had defensive powers as well, being able to prevent attacks with a flash of light, but such things caused it to expend its charge. The sword became far less effective after using its defensive powers, but it could regain its charge by being exposed to sunlight. The blade also had the power to launch rays of powerful radiance like that of the sun, down to the ability to annihilate vampires.</p>
<p>For a wielder with some knowledge of history, fluency in the elven language, and fair skill at arms, Dymondheart could also progress differently, showing other powers. Its lesser powers were available for a wielder who planted a tree and protected it. They included the ability to cast protection from arrows and daylight , as well as block an incoming ranged attack, all once per day. If the wielder slew a treant turned to evil while using the sword, that unlocked its lesser powers, improving the blade's enchantment, and casting a green flame upon those whom it struck, akin to faerie fire ; finally, the blade also gained the ability to protect its wielder with a shielding beneficence, granted by the green powers. Those who unlocked the final level of its powers, which required meditation upon its revealed history, allowed the weapon to reach the pinnacle of its enchantment, as well as unlocking powerful healing abilities, a ward that granted resistance to many kinds of attacks, and at the apex of its power, the sword gained the power to banish extraplanar creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dymondheart grew fully formed out of the trees in The Close . This was a gift from the green powers, gods of the wild, a signal of favor and approval. The blade was passed down from Nentyarch to Nentyarch, being instrumental in keeping the Nar fiends beneath Dun-Tharos sealed. At some point, one Nentyarch lost it in the ruins beneath; the Nentyarch in 1373 DR had recovered the sword in his youth, almost at the cost of his own life. In 1373 DR , the Nentyarch gave the sword to Elowen before sending her to accompany Marrec and Araluen in their quest against the Rotting Man .</p>
