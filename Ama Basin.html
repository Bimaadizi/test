<p>The Ama Basin was the southern part of the land called the Northern Wastes in Kara-Tur . This land was called the Ama Basin in honor of the great river Ama that originated here and ended in the Celestial Sea . Also in these lands were the Koryaz Mountains , which were home to many tribes.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ama Basin was a large, mostly unexplored area consisting of woodlands and swamps, rich with game.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that the least explored part of the Ama Basin's great forests grew on the land that was the site of collapsed expansive mines used in the ancient times.</p>
<p>In the decades following the Spellplague , several powerful onis living in this basin enslaved hobgoblins from the nearby Land of the Snow Spirits , posing a constant threat to the human villages scattered around the region.</p>
<p>Spellscars became unusually prevalent among the hengeyokai of this region. Over time this phenomenon attracted the attention of various sages and wu jen across Kara-Tur.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Ama Basin was home to the Pazruki , Tayanuchi , and Issacortae tribes, as well as bakemono , several korobokuru clans, numerous spirit folk enclaves, and the largest concentration of hengeyokai in all of Kara-Tur. The human barbarian tribes of the basin accorded them a great deal of respect, believing the hengeyokai to be powerful manifestations of the spiritual forces of nature.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Deep within the Ama Basin lay Panjuis , an ancient pixie fortress constructed from three massive trees. The fortress was left to rot and decay for hundreds of years after its ruler, the Pixie King Teremon , passed away, and the other pixies left. By 1359 DR , it was inhabited by a tribe of bakemono, who were repairing the fortress for their own use.</p>
