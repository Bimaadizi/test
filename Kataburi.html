<p>Kataburi was a medium-sized river-port town in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>A bustling port in the midâ€“14 th century DR , Kataburi saw much of the silk from Banda pass through it. Its fishermen caught giant crayfish in the river and sold them to communities up and down its length.</p>
<p>There was also an illicit trade in abducted women, who were kidnapped from T'u Lung in cross-border raids launched from Mhou in Laothan and trafficked by caravan south as far as Kataburi. There, these women were sold in a hidden market by the waterfront and taken to serve as consorts in the households of the immoral people who bought them.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A nice temple here was dedicated to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its giant crayfish. The priest of the temple was Devuri , himself a crayfish hengeyokai .</p>
