<p>The South Wood , also known as the Southwood , was a forest within the Triangle of Trees in the Savage Frontier . It was one of the satellite woodlands that were collectively called the Moonwoods by some local folk.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The forest was relatively young, but still dim and foreboding. It contained the same varieties of trees as the High Forest .</p>
<p>It was a popular stomping grounds for the outdoorsmen of Gray Vale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The South Wood was nestled into the western region of the Delimbiyr Vale just north of Highstar Lake . It served as a border between the Gray Vale to the north and the High Moor to the south.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the mid–14 th century DR , the treant Turlang sought to restore the High Forest to where it reconnected with the South Wood.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , it was populated by a large tribe of aggressive goblins . They attacked caravans—creating an abundance of work for guards and adventurers —and frequently stole everything from supplies to cattle to children from Loudwater and the outlying farms. Their presence made woodcutting a dangerous risk, but one that some daring lumberjacks still took on.</p>
<p>The forest was home to a group of ghosts that hunted spectral boars that appeared among its trees on certain nights. This event inspired the name of the Nighthunt inn.</p>
