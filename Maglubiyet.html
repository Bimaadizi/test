<p>Maglubiyet ( pronounced : / m ɑː ˈ g l ʌ b ɪ j ɛ t / ma-GLUB-i-yet ), known as The Mighty One or The High Chieftain was the chief deity of goblins , hobgoblins , and Dekanter goblins , as well as an exarch of Bane . He was a god of war and leadership who ruled over all the goblinoid deities with an iron fist. As a god of war and a great general he was also known as The Battle Lord .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Maglubiyet appeared as an 11 feet (3.4 meters) tall goblin with black skin and flaming eyes, with strong arms ending in sharp talons.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Maglubiyet's divine realm was Clangor , located in Avalas , the first layer of the plane of Acheron . The mightiest goblin city in Clangor was Shetring , a fortification with five bridges spanning the River Lorfang . Maglubiyet lived at the bottom of a waterfall of the river in a cavern of magnificently carved steel dripping with moisture. He also kept a retreat in the fortified sacred site of Grashmog , which translated from the Goblin language meant the "Heart of Battle."</p>
<p>From his throne of flaming iron, Maglubiyet commanded the souls of goblins, hobgoblins, and worgs to wage eternal war against the orcish petitioners of Gruumsh . He also employed baatezu to bolster his armies.</p>
<p>Maglubiyet allowed the gods Khurgorbaeyag and Nomog-Geaya to live in his realm, if only just to keep an eye on them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>M'Khiin Grubdoubler , a goblin shaman, claimed that Maglubiyet ate whole cows.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Maglubiyet was served by Khurgorbaeyag , goblin god of slavery, oppression, and morale, and Bargrivyek , the god of co-operation and territory among the goblins. Nomog-Geaya , patron deity of the hobgoblins, also paid fealty to Maglubiyet.</p>
<p>Maglubiyet was an unpopular deity with many gods, including those of the elves , dwarves , orcs , and others. Maglubiyet coveted the fertility portfolio of Kikanuti , the good - aligned goblinoid goddess of the desert goblins.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The priests and shamans of Maglubiyet were his mouthpieces on the Material Plane . They fulfilled his demands for blood sacrifices by dispatching victims with an axe. They believed that these sacrifices strengthened Maglubiyet. His clergy was almost always drawn from the goblin and hobgoblin races. The tasloi also worshiped an aspect of Maglubiyet.</p>
<p>Maglubiyet communed with his priests through omens. Blood flowing from the edge of an axe, abnormal behavior in worgs and wolves, and speaking directly through shamans in a trance were all ways he made his will known.</p>
<p>Maglubiyet's holy day was the new moon and his holy weapon was the battleaxe . His goblin worshipers were sometimes referred to as the "sons of Maglubiyet."</p>
