<p>Neremyn Proris was a learned historian and member of the Cormanthor Elves during the reclamation of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Neremyn had light blue-green eyes, long blonde hair, and wore a pale yellow robe decorated with signs of the sun. She carried a short staff or walking stick made of a length of gnarled wood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Neremyn joined the Myth Drannor outskirts camp to help reclaim the city. When they fought with the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul , Tarathiel Miastina learned of the importance of the long-dead Earynspieir Ongluth , who was tied to the mythal in some way. Neremyn's knowledge of Myth Drannor led her to task some adventurers to look into the Throne of Thought and adjacent Mythal Consortium for clues into the mystery, leading to a bout of time travel and historical alteration that resulted in Earynspieir surviving to the present day and being able to assist with the mythal situation.</p>
