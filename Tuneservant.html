<p>Tuneservants were the specialty priests serving Milil , the Lord of All Songs .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tuneservants were among the most adventurous members of their clergy, and would join adventurers on their quests in order to compose ballads narrating their exploits. Others embarked on solitary expeditions, trying to find rare instruments or recover forgotten songs from ages past. They would also protect or rescue musicians who were facing dangers, from the common minstrels to the greatest bards.</p>
<p>Some Tuneservants commanded over temples in remote areas. Such temples were easily recognizable by the modern—sometimes disconcerting—music and songs played inside.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Most tuneservants were skilled singers, poets, musicians and songwriters. They were usually quite wise and charming.</p>

They gained several spells they cast using their musical abilities, including music of the spheres , unearthly choir , shout , forgotten melody , harp of war and Melisander's harp . They also learned several magical songs such as song of compulsion , song of suggestion , were able to speak with rocks and could trap short tunes into rocks to create singing stones . The tuneservant affinity to music was such that they were also able to dispel silence .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Tuneservants tended to train with and favor bludgeoning weapons such as clubs and maces , and could be seen wearing any kind of armor .</p>
