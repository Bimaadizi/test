<p>Abysm was the fortress and palace of the demon lord Demogorgon , located in his realm in the Abyss .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Abysm was located in the ocean portion of Gaping Maw , the 88 th layer of the Abyss . It lay about 100 miles (160 km) off the shores of the city of Lemoriax in the middle of a turbid, briny ocean filled with rocky prominences.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The fortress consisted of two serpentine towers topped with skull-shaped minarets. The towers extended deep below sea level until they reached an opening into the Shadowsea .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of Abysm was marked by twisting stairways and halls.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Demogorgon walked the halls of Abysm meditating on the mysteries of the Abyss and forming his plans. Demogorgon also used the towers to channel his arcane abilities in order to acquire secrets of the Abyss.</p>
<p>The underwater portion of the fortress was used to work experiments and pacts with the obyrith Dagon , which sometimes resulted in sentient creatures that walked the towers' halls.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The maddening presence of Demogorgon induced powerful latent magic effects within Abysm. Some manifested spontaneously, while others were available at the demon lord's will. For example, Demogorgon could summon illusory copies of himself within his lair and could cast the darkness spell a number of times. Continuous latent effects included the spontaneous manifestation of lizards , snakes and other poisonous creatures. The environment could drive beasts aggressive and insane and could also bring madness to humanoids that lingered too long.</p>
