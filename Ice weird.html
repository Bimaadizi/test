<p>Ice weirds were a frozen and crystalline variety of elemental weirds , elemental creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water who possessed an uncanny ability to prognosticate future events, outcomes of various struggles between law and chaos, and esoteric arcane knowledge. Some sages erroneously identified them as fey .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ice weirds were elementals composed of clear ice and shaped to resemble a large and statuesque beautiful woman. Their eyes were lit with flame and their bodies were wrapped in evaporating vapors. Their lower bodies were columns of ice that merged into the large bodies of ice underneath.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ice weirds were creatures of keen intelligence, who lived in constant fear of melting and disappearing. This fear coupled with their intelligence made ice weirds unerring predictors.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They possessed darkvision and heat sense within 60 feet (18 meters). As elementals, ice weirds were completely immune to poison , sleep , paralysis , and being stunned. They could not be flanked nor had any weak spots vulnerable to lucky and deadly attacks, could not be raised , resurrected , nor reincarnated . An ice weird constantly regenerated any damage sustained, however, fire and head made them vulnerable.</p>
<p>They also possessed impressive spellcasting abilities. They could produce divine spells from the chaor , cold , and law domains and had access to sorcerous spells of up to the 9 th circle of magic. Some of the arcane spells in their hands were: mass hold monster , polar ray , dictum , dream , feeblemind , solid fog , wall of ice , and whispering wind among many others.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Unless they or their elemental ice home were threatened, ice weirds did not engage in combat. Their physical attacks left freeze burns on the targets. Otherwise, ice weirds could summon powerful water elementals from the pools of elemental ice they dwelt in with the magical power of the summon monster IX spell. They also could control any and all ice or water elemental creatures within 100 feet (30 meters). Once the control was established, it could only be ended with the elementals' or the weird's deaths.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Their habitats were locations of utter cold, such as glaciers, icebergs, or special ensorcelled chambers that kept the temperatures frigid. When they were not kept by wizards venerating law or chaos to be used for their prognostication, ice weirds were found living a solitary life, in couples or in small charms of three of four individuals. In the wild, their homes were pools of elemental ice that the weirds fully controlled. Any unwanted creature that entered such a pool was instantly and irrevocably transformed into ice.</p>
<p>Weirds spoke Aquan , Auran , Common , and their own language , and used tongues magic to communicate with others.</p>
