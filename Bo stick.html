<p>A bo stick was a type of wooden staff commonly used in the land of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These hard wood staves typically measured around 5​ to ​7 feet (1.5​ to ​2.1 meters) long, though lengths of 7 feet (2.1 meters) were not the norm. The hard wood used in their construction made them hard to break. They greatly resembled quarterstaves in terms of length and balance, but lacked the iron -shod bands one would find on some.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The skills necessary to wield a bo stick were comparable to that of a quarterstaff, though the style in which they were fought with was distinctly different. Commonly classified as a " martial arts weapon", some martial artists made swift blows and twists with their bo sticks to break an opponent's sword .</p>
<p>Due to their length, bo sticks often struck slower than the comparatively shorter jo sticks .</p>
