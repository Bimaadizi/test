<p>The River Fir was a rather nondescript waterway located in the nation of Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Fir originated in the granite mountains of the Running Rocks and extended south a ways until it connected with the great River Rasha , before emptying out into Lake Tirulag .</p>
<p>While not nearly as long, it ran roughly parallel with the north-south road that linked the trade city of Mulptan to the great "City of Warriors" Thasunta .</p>
