<p>Eltoora Sarptyl was the guildmaster of the Many-Starred Cloak in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR and as late as the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She seemed calm and assured of herself. Her clothes were immaculate, as though the dust in the air was repelled from them. While in Port Llast , she used to stare at the sky contemplatively; her eyes were glassy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the outbreak of the Wailing Death , Eltoora would offer the Hero of Neverwinter membership in the Many-Starred Cloak if they were able to retrieve four reagents guarded by mephits across the city, and then defeat a minogon .</p>
<p>She accompanied Aarin Gend - Nasher Alagondar 's spymaster, and Aribeth de Tylmarande to Port Llast on behalf of the guild. While supporting them, she was seeking out five arcane tomes from Imaskar detailing the construction of ancient magical items; she may have recruited the help of the Hero of Neverwinter. Those tomes were the Imaskarran Tome of Death , the Imaskarran Tome of Life , the Imaskarran Tome of Resonance , the Imaskarran Tome of Fire , and the Imaskarran Tome of Ice .</p>
<p>After Aribeth de Tylmarande joined Maugrim Korothir , one of the commanders serving the Old Ones , Eltoora Sarptyl continued providing support to Aarin Gend. During that time, Eltoora maintained a small laboratory in Beorunna's Well â€“ the center of Aarin's search for artifacts to be used against the Old Ones.</p>
