<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Sharantyr followed the tracks of Shandril Shessair through the Tombgate into Tsarn Tombs , she came across some brigands. One of them attacked her with a sword, which was prevented from killing her thanks to an ironguard spell; believing her to be a ghost, the man ran, which Shandril responded to by caving in his skull with a stonemaiden . A fellow brigand chastised the dead man, identifying him as "Helve".</p>
