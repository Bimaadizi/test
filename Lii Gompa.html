<p>Lii Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language ) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot . It was nicknamed the Left Hand of U'Chan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood in central Tabot, at the southern edge of the Po Yul Dzayul Range . Its position north of the capital U'Chan Gompa gave it its title; it stood opposite Pokarr Gompa , the Right Hand of U'Chan.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lii Gompa was the primary rival to neighboring Pokarr Gompa. This might be why Pang , a monk of Pokarr, spoke little of it to Mei Lung when the Dragon visited Tabot circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>It housed over a thousand lamas and novices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lii Gompa was known for its two large annual festivals and its many bells . A legend held that when a true oracle of Tabot died, every bell in Lii Gompa would spontaneously ring nine times to help their soul travel to the Celestial Heavens .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded some time between Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) and Shou Year 640 (−610 DR) , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Lii.</p>
