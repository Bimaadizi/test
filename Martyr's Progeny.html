<p>The Martyr's Progeny was the generation of people in Tantras in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR who'd been orphaned when the deity Torm absorbed the souls of his followers in the city or been spared from sacrifice themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he battled Bane 's avatar over the city of Tantras during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Torm absorbed the souls of his faithful so he might have the power necessary to defeat the Black Lord, even knowing that those whose souls had been taken would die instantly. This soul transference was voluntary, but it was popular in the heavily Tormtar cityâ€”thousands were taken and whole neighborhoods emptied. But at the risk of not gaining enough power from the available souls, Torm would not ask the children (aged up to 14 or so) to do the same, for most could not fully understand. Regardless, Torm died defeating Bane.</p>
<p>Afterward, Torm was restored to life, but all those martyrs, of course, were not. Many children had been left orphaned by their parents' sacrifices and Torm had assured their martyred parents they would be well looked after. They were adopted by the Tormtar temples and they became known as the Martyr's Progeny.</p>
<p>As of 1372 DR , they were aged between 14 and 28. Many had joined the clergy.</p>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>The views of this generation varied. Some zealously embraced the church of Torm , particularly those who'd been too young to remember their parents. But others resented the god for taking their parents, and put up with their church education only until they could go out on their own and decide their own path in life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In the years after, some of the Progeny displayed powers linked to courage and strength. Certainly, they tended to have militia training, a strong will, or acting quickly, even being pushy.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Well equipped by the church, adventurers tended to receive a master-crafted greatsword or banded mail with heavy steel shield , or a scroll of silver dragonmail .</p>
