<p>Urthag the Knife was a infamous pirate who preyed on the Dragon Reach in north Faerûn around the early 7th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Urthag somehow got his hands on Galathos , a magic sword forged during the ancient empire of Raumathar and lost many centuries before.</p>
<p>He spent some time in the city of Chessagol in the Vast , and boldly caroused for several hours at the Bloated Gargoyle Inn . Finally, the Royal Constabulary discovered him and tried to arrest him. Urthag fled across the rooftops of Chessagol, but was forced to drop Galathos. Urthag escaped and his sword was given to King Lamoth .</p>
<p>Legend had it that Urthag the Knife buried his treasure on the island of Two Rocks in the harbor of Harrowdale Town in the Dalelands . However, not a trace of this hoard was found by the mid–14th century DR .</p>
