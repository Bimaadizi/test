<p>Thoben Midler was a young member of the extended Midler family in the mid-1480s DR , who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thoben was a young man with blond hair, and wore a gray tunic .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Thoben was the second son of Ricnan Midler and Jandove Midler , and younger brother of Normon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave . Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.</p>
<p>Thoben was kept in the cellar of the house under guard alongside his grandparents Wilaver and Caryn .</p>
