<p>Dragonfire adepts were wielders of draconic magic and arcane power although not in the conventional sense associated with draconic sorcerers . Rather than arcane magic , or even spells , dragonfire adepts emulated draconic powers by infusing their very souls with the raw magic of dragons, allowing them to draw upon a direct link with the nature of draconic existence and channel it through invocations akin to those of warlocks .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dragonfire adepts divided their time between practicing their dragon breath , studying arcane invocations, and working to build a strong base of friends and allies. They kept in mind the nobility and grace of the dragons they sought to understand and acted in all ways as they would expect a dragon to, thus making them fierce friends as well as terrible foes, and confident in their every action. However, while they saw the value of treasure, they were not defined or slowed by their property, considering self-improvement the only kind worth their time, and taking every opportunity to test themselves against the challenges of the world.</p>
<p>However, the concerns and biases of their own people colored the perspectives of dragonfire adepts. Their desire to prove themselves draconic layered over the more typical interests, rather than becoming an all-consuming obsession. No matter what kind of person a dragonfire adept was, they were universally imposing figures. Hearty, learned and cunning, they could be be masters of war or lore with equal ease. They remained alert for new sources of draconic knowledge and investigate likely leads or promising instructors.</p>
<p>Dragonfire adepts could be of any alignment , often acting similar to dragons that shared their general outlook. Good adepts were bold champions of justice and freedom who brought the power of dragons to aid those in need, nobly defending the weak, frightened and downtrodden. Evil adepts were cruel tyrants and merciless raiders who imposed their wills on others, built strongholds and dominated lands, and always sought riches and power, uncaring of who was hurt in their hungry pursuit for more. Adepts of good, evil, law and chaos were about equally common, although they were frequently found among good creatures and less so among evil ones. Neutral adepts meanwhile were rare, the urge to delve into the mysteries of draconic energies coming more easily to those with strong beliefs and the will to pursue them.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Dragonfire adepts spent their lives learning the secrets of a race older and stronger than their own, studying arguably the oldest and most powerful force a mortal could manipulate, that of a dragon's breath. They were devoted to understanding and emulating the ways of dragons, an interest strong enough to motivate years of difficult study, practice and experimentation. Such focus was likely rooted in a life-changing event involving a dragon, whether their breath brought salvation or tragedy.</p>
<p>Yet the quest for dragon-like powers never eclipsed in importance what the adepts wanted to achieve with that power. They remained steadfast in their goals, typically something simple but grand that required years or even a lifetime of work. This could be righting an ancient wrong, founding their own school, community or kingdom, eliminating an entire group of foes, or just being acknowledged by true dragons as one of their own.</p>
<p>Dragonfire adepts could be found in all manner of civilizations, from primitive tribes, where they acted as mystics not dissimilar to dragon shamans , to noble families of draconic descent.</p>
<p>Most dragonfire adepts paid little attention to religion, focusing more on dragons than deities. Among those with religious tendencies, members of the draconic pantheon were popular choices they were willing to worship even where such faiths were rare (and could very well be the source of their powers), or they were drawn to the same gods as sorcerers. Furthermore, adepts were aware of their constant struggle to become more like another species, and revered figures in history who accomplished this to impressive degrees.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The source of the power used by dragonfire adepts was sometimes similar to that of sorcerers, where they accessed the innate power of their own blood. In such cases, the adept was either descended from an extremely powerful dragon of their homeland or rediscovered a long-lost link to an ancient, powerful wyrm. Sorcerers, especially half-dragon ones, could duplicate many of the abilities of dragonfire adepts such that it could be difficult to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the power of a dragonfire adept could be acquired by forging pacts with powerful draconic beings, such as dragon deities or dragon ascendants . Dragon gods were the most common sources of such pacts, with Tiamat and Bahamut making the most. The next most common sources were powerful users of draconic magic and augmented dragons with extraplanar or otherwise unusual power. In Faer√ªn, such dragons include the likes of the pseudonatural dragon Arsekaslyx , the most powerful sorcerer of true dragonkind, Nexus , or the dracoliches Alasklerbanbastos or Dretchroyaster .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Dragonfire adepts could achieve with their breath weapons effects that not even dragons themselves could match. On the lower end of their abilities, they could unleash blasts of elemental energies in lines or cones, but as they gained power they accessed the secondary breath weapons of metallic dragons and other exotic powers. At their mightiests, adepts could unleash the discorporating breath of Bahamut, which disintegrated its targets, or the fivefold breath of Tiamat, which unleashed five breath weapons at once. Yet, while their breath weapon was their most obvious draconic link, dragonfire adepts learned many powerful abilities as they grew, tapping into new powers the deeper they delved into the draconic magic in their souls.</p>
<p>The magic of dragonfire adepts was more primal, if not less tricky, than that of true spells, a repertoire of spell-like abilities known as "draconic invocations", which allowed them to focus the energy that suffused their souls. Invocations existed on a scale of least, lesser, greater and dark, each more powerful than the last. The invocations an adept chose to learn strongly shaped their abilities, and all invocations at an adept's disposal could be used at will, but like spells could be disrupted if their concentration faltered or they wore armor , and all of them required somatic movements.</p>
<p>As they gained power, dragonfire adepts gained thick and scaly skin that provided them natural protection, usually but not always of the same chromatic or metallic hue of their outlook and alignment, and would eventually start to resist magic. They would become immune to paralyzing and sleep -inducing effects just as dragons were, as well as to their unnerving presence, and more easily fraternize with draconic creatures.</p>
<p>Dragonfire adepts were heavily invested in combat prowess due to the confrontational nature of breath weapons, but had some versatility due to their invocations. They could be bottomless sources of arcane destruction, help provide support, confuse and weaken foes, or bring sage wisdom. They served best at hitting several foes from a middling distance, generally relying on allies to keep enemies at bay, and while they lacked the sheer offensive, defensive, or ranged abilities that others brought to the table, they had a unique resistance to magic and ability to improve the prowess and circumstances of those around them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The reception dragonfire adepts received from communities corresponded to how their cultures regarded dragons, and those who would emulate them. In places that suffered from draconic depredations, the people were often fearful or hostile towards anyone with their powers, regardless of their moral alignment , whereas in areas where dragons were perceived as defenders or sages, they were more likely to be seen like sorcerers, as great manipulators of magic. In any case, dragonfire adepts were often feared and misunderstood, for they carried the same aura of awesome power, mystery, and terrifying intensity found in true dragons . They were dealt with most savvily in places where they were common.</p>
<p>Dragonfire adepts were tolerant of all manner of peoples, professions and paths to power, so long as they were respected and had compatible personalities and outlooks. They valued study, discipline and raw power in particularly however, and could most appreciate those who showed similar traits. They got along well with spellcasters for example ( bards and druids in particular), because they could see them delve into the essence of their focus (such as music or nature) just as they delved into the essence of dragonkind. They were similarly impressed by fighters and monks , who had devoted themselves to mastery of combat and self-improvement, although monks themselves were often puzzled by the adepts, seeing them as fools seeking to become something freakish at best and monstrous at worst. It was sorcerers who were strongly drawn to dragonfire adepts however, for they oft-shared a primal link to dragonkind .</p>
<p>Most dragonfire adepts were humans , elves , or half-elves , since the study of dragonkind was not unlike that of arcane magic . A surprising number of them were half-orcs , who sought either a place for themselves or to create one by force. It was not uncommon for dragonborn of Bahamut to become dragonfire adepts, their reawakening by Xymor granting them the innate power to manifest dragon magic and breath.</p>
<p>Dwarves were rarely dragonfire adepts, and in fact were extremely suspicious of them; they had an ancient enmity with dragonkind, and viewed dragonfire adepts as two-legged versions of the greedy, treasure-loving monsters that often raided their settlements. They were especially doubtful of dwarf dragonfire adepts, who they saw as traitors to their own race. Most halflings and gnomes lacked the burning drive needed to become dragonfire adepts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>There were a few notable figures who appeared in the legends of dragonfire adepts. One was Gannon Darkheart, a human whose ancestry had the blood of black dragons mixed in generations prior. Born into noble life, his avarice and wild temper led to him becoming an outcast, and so he sought to become more dragon-like to punish his community for their scorn. Not actively evil but unconcerned with morality, he could never be trusted to keep his word and willingly allied with anyone that could help him with his goal. He charged heedless into battle with the most destructive powers, assuming he could kill anything before it got the chance to harm him. Ultimately he earned his place beside true dragons by defeating the gold dragon Aghutyr in single combat and taking his tower, turning it into his own kingdom and turning the area around it into a dread marsh.</p>
<p>By contrast, Vorelei Frilltips had no initial draconic leanings. She began life poor and homeless on the streets of a large elf city, but with an innate sense of fair play and concern for those in trouble. Her bravery drew the attention of Gaulirden, a silver dragon secretly living in the city who took her under his wing and raised her with his older children, where she learned draconic ways and assumed their powers to help the less fortunate. She destroyed the Circle of Fire, a vile school for evil wizards , and ultimately gave her life defending a town from a blackguard 's army long enough for the innocent to escape. A council of good dragons buried her as one of their own, the honor she never asked for in life granted to her in death.</p>
<p>It is unclear if these stories are legends from the ancient past, brought over from other the dragonfire adepts of other worlds , or fictional altogether, allegories used by dragonfire adepts to explore their philosophies and beliefs.</p>
