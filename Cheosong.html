<p>A cheosong was a type of dress worn by cosmopolitan women of Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A cheosong was a narrow, form-fitting dress. The slitted skirt typically reached almost to the ground. The tight bodice had a high collar and front buttons. Most cheosong were made from fine silk and embroidered in gold or silk thread depicting mythological imagery that wrapped around the woman from chest to hem.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>A cheosong had two slits in the skirt that extended as high as even the hips, making the dress too revealing for many women to feel comfortable wearing in public. It was not, therefore, worn in other Kara-Turan lands outside of Shou Lung, and even within Shou Lung it was popular only among high nobles, sing-song girls and other entertainers, and the women of the Wang Kuo province.</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>Older women were known to wear a less-revealing version of the cheosong called the cheo-sam . A cheo-sam did not have the slitted skirt and was a looser garment, much like a robe. It maintained the high collar of a cheosong but added extra-baggy sleeves.</p>
