<p>By Uktar of the same year, Duke Entar was back with the rest of the council, guiding the city through another crisis. The Shining Crusade emerged as a new threat to the Sword Coast. As the Grand Dukes dedicated 100 Flaming Fist soldiers to the Coalition army, Entar's daughter Skie attempted to secretly join their ranks. Fully aware of her actions, Duke Silvershield had his daughter looked after by the Flaming Fist corporal, Bence Duncan .</p>
<p>Following the last battle of the War of the Shining Crusade at Dragonspear Castle , a horrific event occurred that shook Entar Silvershield to his core. A mysterious hooded figure murdered Skie in cold blood and framed the Hero of Dragonspear, Abdel Adrian for the crime.
