<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lydia was a halfling woman with a light skin tone and light brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death ravaged Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Lydia's home district, Beggar's Nest, was hit the hardest. Those who died of the plague were burned on the city streets, and, to make things worse, the district erupted in a zombie infestation. Lydia managed to evacuate from the district before it was quarantined off by the Neverwintran militia. Now homeless, Lydia had to sleep on city streets by a beggars' campfire in the City Core , where she mourned her old home and the fact that she couldn't wait for the plague to take her in the comfort of her own bed.</p>
