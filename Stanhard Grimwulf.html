<p>Stanhard Grimwulf was an Uthgardt human chief of the Elk tribe of the Evermoors in the Savage Frontier in the late 14 th century DR . Notably, he was a possessor of the helmet of disjunction , a relic with the power to break all magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR , the Elk tribe battled the black dragon Rakor and the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction . Although Stanhard's Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, Rakor more than up the different by flying overhead and vomiting acid on the barbarians' ranks. Stanhard gave the helmet to one of his men, Toke Horgath to carry to safety, but Toke was abruptly slain by a Dragon Cultist. Ordering a retreat, Stanhard retrieved the helmet and entrusted it to his fastest rider, Ven Salafin , to get it away from Rakor however he could before the chief was dissolved in acid as well. The fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a sacred burial ground on the site .</p>
<p>A century later, in the late 1490s DR, the body of Stanhard Grimwulf was exhumed by Edgin Darvis , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Holga Kilgore (a member of the Elk tribe herself). Using Simon's deathly token to speak with the dead , they questioned the long-dead chief over the fate of the helmet of disjunction .</p>
