<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Z'rell visited the Shattered Sanctum , one of the strongholds maintained by the cult of the Absolute. Z'rell "complimented" its goblin members, saying they may not be worthless if they killed humans as well as they chased chickens . This garnered Z'rell the affections of Klagga , a goblin raider with a stumpy leg and a bad eye.</p>
<p>Under the orders from Ketheric Thorm, Z'rell handpicked an envoy to establish contact with the Shadow Druids â€“ an important tool in distracting, weakening, and corrupting the Emerald Grove and the Cloak Wood druidic circles . Z'rell's pick was to coerce, threaten, and bribe the Shadow Druids, and eventually, infecting them with illithid tadpoles.</p>
