<p>The Six Shields was a rough and dirty rooming house located in Ashabenford in the late 1300s DR . It provided housing and food for the field hands, drovers, or other laborers of Mistledale , but did not discriminate against those who simply could not afford the Ashabenford Arms or White Hart Inn .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located east, also downwind, of Lhuin's tannery within the town. Most of the tenants would spend evenings on the porch; this was rather ironic given the malodorous scents wafting down from the tannery.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>A bed for a night cost 1 cp , or 6 sp for a tenday; the latter included use of the stables and two daily meals of milk, cheese, and hard bread.</p>
