<p>Adamarondor was an ancient gold dragon who served as the steed and messenger of the Magister at Azuth 's behest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He spent some time in the town of Sambryntyn in Turmish , disguised as a female human barmaid named "Liliatha," and working at The Adept's Choice tavern. When called into the service of Azuth, Adamarondor left town, but not before informing the tavern's patrons about a key that would lead them to his hoard. Though they initially dismissed it as a tall tale, several townspeople unsuccessfully searched for the hoard. Unfortunately, the key ended up lost in a stream following a fight.</p>
