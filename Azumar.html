<p>Azumar , later known as the Necropolis of Azumar , was a city found in Anauria , one of the three survivor states established in Anauroch after the fall of ancient Netheril . It was ruled over by the benevolent and selfless Prince Hamukai .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city comprised once-grand stone buildings between which ran winding roads.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>For centuries, Azumar served as the resting place for one of the Nether Scrolls . It was safeguarded by the Consortium of Three , Netherese wizards that dutifully served Prince Hamukai.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Azumar was destroyed by the Zikzorishka , a blue dragon that sought to seize the Nether Scroll from Prince Hamukai. Fortunately, the Consortium of Three led survivors of the city away and found refuge in the cliffs of Haruun . The Consortium of Three sealed the prince and the Nether Scroll away in a tomb deep beneath the city, protected in a state of magical stasis.</p>
<p>Over time it was swallowed up by the sands of the desert. Zikzorishka underwent the transformation to lichdom and made the ruined city her lair, determined to outwait the obstinate prince.</p>
