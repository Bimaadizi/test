<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gorge was deep and dark. On one side of the canyon, the walls were sheer granite cliffs, against which the Wyrm River flowed. On the other side was a road full of ruts that led to the mines of Earl Radborne Wynn . Small footpaths led up a steep, rocky slope to the various silver mines from the road. Pine trees used to cover the slope, but were cut down because of the mining.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
