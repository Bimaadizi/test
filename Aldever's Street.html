<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Aldever's Street began at the south wall of the city at Captains' Court , which sat on the north side of the road opposite the Hall of Warriors temple.

It then turned north between Captains' Close on the east side and the Ruins of Illusk on the west before ending at the city market. The road continued eastward as Setting Sun Street .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Aldever's Street was a notably safe road by Luskan's standards, owing to the Luskanite soldiers standing guard at Captains' Court and the Hall of Warriors. Whenever Luskan mustered for war, Aldever's Street was the site of soldiers marching in formation as they made their way to the temple for mandatory prayers to Tempus .</p>
