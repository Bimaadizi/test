<p>Thurnas Netmaster was the head of the slaver ring based on the Oasis of the White Palm that had taken over the Sandvoyagers' Guild in 1356Â DR , at the time of the release of the efreet Khalitharius .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Thurnas wielded an enchanted plate armor, and both a shield and a longsword with a stronger enchantment. His office had a small trap door which led to the Temple of Set , underneath the Oasis.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Thurnas possessed some level of heroic strength, and an optimum level of health and endurance.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Thurnas was the leader of the slaver ring; he had replaced the guildmaster of the Sandvoyagers, Tolnus Granicus, modifying the guild ledgers to hide his actions and was currently working with drow allies. He believed the sheik's adventurers were not just wanderers who came across the oasis, and would have preferred to capture them for sale, but preferred to keep a low profile at the moment, since the dervish fanatics he had tried to deal with had grown upset with him and he was under constant threat of discovery from the Sheik. Korus Eikoth , in particular, was known to grumble about his untrustworthiness. Per Hogan Underwood , Thurnas possessed a sand sled and used it occassionally.</p>
<p>Netmaster had sent an assassin to capture the bride, Zorath Blackblade ; he had not found her. The slaver was still looking for her, though he believed the dervishes were holding her already and were trying to back out on their agreement.</p>
