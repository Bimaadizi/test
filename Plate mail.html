<p>Plate mail (sometimes known as half plate , but not to be confused with the half-armor style of that name ) was a form of heavy armor used in Faerûn and beyond. It was a type of plate armor widely used by warriors, and valued for its protection and versatility.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though subject to countless variations and styles, plate mail broadly consisted of partial chain mail combined with solid shaped steel plates that covered vital areas. This included a cuirass , armored gauntlets , greaves , tassets , elbow and knee guards, and epaulettes , held together by buckles and straps (a helmet was also well-advised). This loose-fitting, modular design meant that the whole ensemble was easier to fit to new wearers, especially compared to suits of field plate and full plate which were custom-made and fitted. Brigandine could also be used instead of chain mail, though it was less flexible and less popular. In addition to steel, less common forms of plate mail could utilize bronze , special woods, chitin , and dragon scales .</p>
<p>Barding for animals and mounts could be made with a style similar to the mixed plate and chain worn by people, and this too gave good protection at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Thanks to the addition of plate pieces, this form of armor was more protective than splint mail , banded mail , chain mail, and the rare bronze plate mail , and withstood heavy use and abuse better too. It was especially effective against slashing and chopping strikes, and had no particular weaknesses or vulnerabilities. As it used less advanced techniques to make than elaborate full plate or field plate, it was much cheaper and more accessible for warriors, though still an expensive investment. Because of its balance of qualities, this form of plate was among the most popular and standardized forms of armor used by professional soldiers, knights, mercenaries , and sensible adventurers . A rare form of this plate was dwarven plate mail , a design that offered superior protection.</p>
