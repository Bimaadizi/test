<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book collected several stories, with the tale titled The House on Drench Lane being its flagship work. The story told of a woman who had unnerving dreams of her neighbor standing outside naked in the rain. The woman's vivid dreams became reality when, one rainy day, she looked out of the window and saw the entire community outside, naked in the rain. She witnessed their familiar faces with the blank stares of stuffed animals, all looking at her, calling to come out. Despite being terrified, something alluring was in their calls. When she stepped outside, the nude community stripped her naked, wet and cold, and gave the woman to her neighbor, who smiled at her with an unnerving smile. And then the woman suddenly woke up, everything being seemingly ordinary. But several tendays later, she discovered she was pregnant and was gripped by terror and paranoia. She unsuccessfully tried to end the pregnancy and, in the end, was left with just terror and dread.</p>
