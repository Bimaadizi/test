<p>Master Kendai Kousra was a great warrior from Kara-Tur , whose spirit inhabited their ancestral katana called the Sword Saint Legacy .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that a master warrior's ultimate challenge was death so many noble heroes sacrificed their mortal shells and placed their spirits within ancestral katanas, making them as powerfully-enchanted as the warrior's spirit that inhabited the weapons. It was believed that the great Master Kendai Kousra performed such a ritual sometime long before the late 14 th century DR , placing their spirit in the Sword Saint Legacy katana. Legends claimed that the blade became so powerful that a deity claimed it as his favorite weapon.</p>
