<p>Mashers , also known as coral mashers , were an uncommon large species of fish .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures had rusty-red, worm -like bodies, that grew to be around 12​ to ​15 feet (3.7​ to ​4.6 meters) in length. On their backs were around four to eight dorsal spines that were 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length or longer and bright blue in hue.</p>
<p>Mashers swam at a very leisurely pace, though they could maneuver themselves very swiftly when needed.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Mashers were not aggressive creatures, though they could easily be surprised.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>The dorsal spines on mashers had poisonous secretions. The poison secreted by their dorsal ridges was very complex and there was no known natural antidote for it, thus only spells like neutralize poison could save those affected by it.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Mashers typically attacked in self-defense. When feeling threatened, they flared out their spines in order to dissuade perceived threats from attacking, They also maneuvered themselves to parry attacks or stab opponents and poison them, twisting and rolling their bodies to further injure them.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>The alternative name of these creatures was derived from the fact that they primarily crushed up and ate the coral found in their habitat.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were typically found in coral reefs in tropical regions.</p>
<p>On Toril , mashers were primarily known to be found in the waters around Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Due to their poison having no known natural cure outside of magical means, some tried to hunt mashers in order to obtain it.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some adventurers claimed mashers were relatively helpless if one positioned themselves in front of or below them when attacking.</p>
