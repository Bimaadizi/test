<p>A mineral mephit was a mephit from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mineral mephits were bulky and rigid, as were earth mephits . Their metal wings glittered with shiny pieces of silica, but didn't actually function during flight. These odorless mephits were very clumsy during such flight.</p>
<p>These creatures could pass through stone walls up to 1 foot (0.3 meters) thick, as if they were insubstantial. Oddly enough, these mineral mephits didn't breathe at all.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Such mephits were self-centered, stubborn, and greedy, an attitude typical of those of their home plane. They guarded their own treasure vigilantly, and may have guarded valuables belonging to other creatures.</p>
<p>They were known to generally have an enmity towards any creatures who tried to take minerals from the plane.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>During combat, mineral mephits attacked with their claws, and used glitterdust to blind and reveal their foes. They could also gate in other mephits, but only their own type and earth mephits .</p>
<p>They were immune to all gas-based attacks and spells , such as those that filled areas with stinking gas . Non- magical weapons that pierced did not affect them, but transmuting rock to mud would instantly morph their shape, killing them. When in contact with rocks or jewelry, they could regenerate quickly, but consumed gems in the process.</p>
