<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fenthaza belonged to a cult of yuan-ti that had founded the Fane of the Night Serpent , a temple hidden beneath the palace of Omu . As high priest of Dendar, Fenthaza performed the ritual to transform Ras Nsi into a yuan-ti malison , though she later began doubting his role as cult leader. This led to Fenthaza planning a coup to end Ras Nsi's rule.</p>
