<p>Hare hengeyokai ( pronounced : / h ɛ n g ɛ j oʊ k aɪ / hen-geh-yo-kigh ) or simply hares were a hare -based subrace of the hengeyokai , a race of intelligent natural shapechanging animals able to adopt hare, human , and hybrid forms. They shared all the common traits and habits of hengeyokai, plus those discussed below.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In human form, a hengeyokai had some feature reminiscent of their animal form. For a hare hengeyokai, this might be wide brown eyes, and more subtly, lightning-quick reflexes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Compared to humans and the average hengeyokai, hares were slightly wiser but less strong, or they were more agile. They were adept in athletics skills.</p>
<p>Their tiny, quick animal forms were among the hardest to hit and they were the most swift-moving. Even in hybrid form, they ran much faster than any typical humanoid of their size.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>On the whole, hares were good-hearted. Like their namesake animals, they were peaceable by nature but easily surprised or frightened and they were quiet but alert for threats. They never consumed meat.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Some hares worshiped the god of the warren .</p>
<p>Hares, along with carps , cranes , dogs , and monkeys , were more likely to become monks than other hengeyokai.</p>
