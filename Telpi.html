<p>Telpi was a language spoken by the inhabitants of the Dragon Coast and the Pirate Isles , from Proskur in the north to Nathlekh in the south, and from Iriaebor in the west to the Pirate and Whamite Isles in the east.</p>
<p>Telpi was the only East Thorass language , but it included three dialects— Dragonsmere , Pirate pidgin / argot , and Whamite . The dialect of the pirates of the Sea of Fallen Stars was strongly influenced by other languages of the region. They used it as a sort of secret language for carrying on their illegal activities.</p>
