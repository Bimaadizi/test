<p>Kalmog was a grey orc warden in charge of the ancient dwarven prison in Undermountain , controlled by Horazak midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kalmog was the part of the marauding group of humanoids who operated out of Undermountain under the leadership of a cruel orc of devil blood Horazak. The orc leader was allied with Azurna , the High Priestess of Lolth who was plotting downfall of Waterdeep in 1370 DR .</p>
<p>Kalmog was a trusted warden in charge of the ancient prison complex taken over by the marauders. Under Kalmog's iron fist, the humanoids abducted slaves from above and below, forcing goblins and kobolds to work in the ancient mines under the prison and held the keys to the cells of the prisoners of value. Kalmog was blamed for any of the prisoners escaping of any trouble in the complex.</p>
<p>Khelben Arunsun sent his trusted agent, a lone adventurer, to investigate a sinister drow plot. Shortly after the hero arrived, the entire prison came under lockdown as Horazak, the only keeper of the main entrance keys, departed the complex. During that time, the marauders were distracted by two escaped slaves, Tryola Perrentine and Urkantor . Soon after, Kalmog was slain by the Khelbenite during his assault on Tia , one of the slaves and prisoners.</p>
