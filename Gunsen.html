<p>A gunsen , also known as an iron fan , war fan , or tessen , was a primarily defensive weapon used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gunsen was similar to a buckler , but it was held by a handle like that of a hand fan, and so it was not possible to also hold a weapon in that hand. Most were about 1 foot (30 centimeters) and weighed about 1 pound (0.45 kilograms). Most were made of iron. They were typically used as shields but could be used as weapons if the situation called for it. They were frequently used by geisha-ninjas .</p>
