<p>Mossbridges was a town in the Vast , lying where the Coast Road between Ravens Bluff and Tantras crossed the Fire River , over the bridge of the same name. Feldar's Trail began at Mossbridges and joined to Highbank Forest .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village of Mossbridges was divided into two areas known as New Town and Old Town. These were distinct from each other in terms of their inhabitants and the age of their architecture. New Town in particular hosted a variety of shops. Bordering Old Town was a pair of old, but sturdy bridges, which were said to be the namesake of the village.</p>
<p>The village's main landmark was a newer bridge built around the 1350's DR. This massive, multi-span bridge stretched across the Fire River and beared the Coast Road. Formerly called the Fire River Bridge, it was more generally known as "Mossbridges", and claimed by some to be the true namesake of the town despite the fact that no moss covered it like the older bridges. It was also known as the "Great Bridge", but the engineers and stonemasons who worked on it simply called it "the Bridge".</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was located roughly 8 mi (13,000 m) northeast of the city of Ravens Bluff.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , Mossbridges was home to Lord Thalmir , one of the wealthiest petty lords in the area. and the sole descendant of a long family line to have residence in the village. From 1370 DR, Mossbridges was incorporated into the city-state of Ravens Bluff, and held allegiance to it.</p>
<h2>Law & order</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR, Mossbridges was policed by Rulisqer of Tyr , a paladin of the god of justice Tyr , together with his fourteen followers. They believed that public safety and lawful behavior would bring happiness and prosperity to all. Through diligent, expert policing, they broke up brawls in the streets and kept out thieves' guilds . Those who drew a weapon would soon find themselves subdued, disarmed, and marched out of town. The Tyrrans seemed to always know when and where there was going to be trouble. Thanks to their efforts, Mossbridges saw very little crime.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Mossbridges in the 14th century largely served Ravens Bluff as a warehouse district, a staging area for caravans, and a center for horse trading and stabling, as well as through its stockyards. Consequently, a great deal of wealth passed through Mossbridges, but this was kept safe by the efforts of the Tyrrans.</p>
<p>The good security led to Mossbridges being utilized as a neutral, "no swords" meeting ground for those who would otherwise come into conflict, such as traditional foes who needed to trade or negotiate. Some merchants who preferred not to stay in Ravens Bluff—a few of who had made enemies there—based themselves in nearby Mossbridges instead. They arranged for clients and creditors to meet them in the town.</p>
<p>Both the Tyrran security and the neutral ground encouraged investment and even banking in Mossbridges. A fledgling but prosperous banking industry had sprung up by 1370 DR.</p>
<p>The civic authorities of both Ravens Bluff and Tantras paid a corps of engineers and stonemasons based in Mossbridges to maintain the bridge over the Fire River, which they simply called "the Bridge". They could never be persuaded to risk or sabotage the bridge, but were corrupt in other areas. For a hefty bribe, they would conceal bodies, treasure, and telltale items in the bridge pilings, where they might remain for a good long time. Both the corps and the stashing operation were led by the foreman, Klonalogh Umesker , in 1370 DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The bridge over the Fire River was built during the kingdom of Roldilar , a dwarven surface realm founded in the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR . The bridge lay a few miles upstream of the secure trading center of Sarbreen at the mouth of the river. Although Roldilar and Sarbeen fell to orcs in the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR , the bridge survived.</p>
<p>As humans began to settle the coastline of the Vast, Sarbreen remained dangerous but the river remained useful. So local farmers and merchants gathered instead at the Fire River Bridge, as they called it, where they traded their goods and coin. A settlement grew, and bridge and community came to be known as Mossbridges. Sarbreen was eventually resettled, becoming the city of Ravens Bluff in the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR .</p>
<p>Late in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , a rash of cow killings occurred in Mossbridges. The superstitious villagers all suspected Alice Clarkson , a retired adventurer and mage who was living in the village, of being responsible and believed she was a witch intent on using their cows in evil experiments. On Eleint 13 , the villagers stormed her home as an angry mob, pulled her out, and had her burned at the stake. When another cow disappeared later that night the villagers organized a posse to patrol the surrounding farms over the coming nights, until eventually a figure was spotted carrying away a slain cow. Tracking the figure down to a nearby cave, the true culprits were revealed to be two trolls led by a gnoll . Archers kept the three humanoids pinned down inside the cave whilst the rest of the villagers pelted it with Greek fire , eventually killing them. Afterwards the people of Mossbridges, feeling tremendous guilt and shame over what they had done to Alice, erected a tombstone for her in their cemetery and vowed never to speak of what happened to her ever again.</p>
<p>The part of the village that would become known as New Town would have most of its buildings constructed during the 1350's DR , as would the Fire River Bridge.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Ravens Bluff was working to establish a regional government in the Vast by taking a number of neighboring towns and villages under its control. Mossbridges and the newly settled New Hope were the two communities to be incorporated into the city-state. After suffering eight sudden attacks within three months, the people of Mossbridges pleaded with Ravens Bluff for protection. The town had barely enough time to rebuild between humanoid and mercenary attacks and was desperate for protection. Thankfully, Ravens Bluff and Mossbridges had longstanding friendly relations. Acting Mayor Belanor Fenmarel of the Bluff responded swiftly and pledged a force to Mossbridges' defense in exchange for a tariff reduction agreement for Ravenaar goods entering and exiting Mossbridges. The Acting Mayor assigned a group of mages to magically transport goods, supplies, and food in town's aid.</p>
<p>Following the Three Women War , the newly-elected mayor Amber Lynn Thoden presented Lorien Keltree Darkarrow with the title of Baron of Mossbridges, along with a title to the lands and estates of Fort Thoden.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Mossbridges was inhabited by a combination of farmers, wealthy merchants, and various workers related to the commerce that traveled through the village. The farmers, their families, and farmhands largely inhabited the area known as Old Town, whilst the merchants and various other workers inhabited New Town. The older generations among Old Town were superstitious of magic-users , which was cause for mockery among the far less superstitious people of New Town. The people of New Town also considered themselves to be Ravenians and petitioned for the city to annex Mossbridges until its eventual incorporation in 1370 DR. The two groups rarely intermingled, safe for inside The Blushing Gynosphinx.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumor had it that the only successful criminal in Mossbridges was a semi-retired smuggler who still dealt with pirates. Supposedly, she was some kind of amphibious shape-changer who would take the form of a giant octopus to swim out to pirates when they signaled from offshore. It was said she kept her loot stashed underwater, not far from land. One drunken fellow in a tavern claimed it was kept inside giant clams and that they snapped shut on and trapped unauthorized people, though this was given little credence, of course.</p>
