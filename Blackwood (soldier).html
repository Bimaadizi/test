<p>Blackwood was a human officer of the Neverwinter Guard in Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had long hair and a beard.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Blackwood owned a darksteel greataxe with a telescoping haft that was forged by Ghelryn Foehammer of Triboar . He cleaned it with boiled linseed oil once a month, but Holga thought this should be once every seven days or so to as it was displaying rusting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Blackwood became a loyal henchman of Lord Forge Fitzwilliam and his wizard advisor Sofina when they took power in Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR. After Sofina captured Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore in Castle Never , Forge ordered Blackwood to take them back to the Revel's End prison and collect the bounty on them. But Sofina whispered in Blackwood's ear that he should discreetly kill them instead. He and his soldiers led the pair into a shadowy back alley to execute them. But Holga recognized Blackwood's axe and keenly asked about its make, use, and maintenance, even criticized his laxness. All this bought time for Holga to pry loose a paving stone and use it as a weapon as she escaped and defeated the guards. Blackwood recovered and tried to get Holga from behind, but was clobbered by Edgin's reinforced lute . Holga caught and kept the axe.</p>
<p>Later, Sofina sent for Dralas and his band of six fellow Thayan assassins. Arriving by boat on the Neverwinter River , Dralas met Sofina, Blackwood, and some of his soldiers at the docks. Sofina ordered Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his soldiers because they had failed to stop Edgin and Holga's escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.</p>
