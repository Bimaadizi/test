<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369Â DR , Maervidal Iloster was caught as a double agent by the Zhentarim; he received three insistent invites to a revel at Warmfires House from three different Zhentarim agents he knew within as many days, deducing they intended to kill him there because of their insistence on the invite and their insinuations they would hurt other people if he weren't to show up. Desperate and not daring leave the Dale lest he trigger a massacre that way, he crossed paths briefly with Storm Silverhand , and was struck by inspiration to ask her for help. She heard him out, then cast a spell that transformed their bodies into the shape of the other's, giving him instructions to stand in for her at the Old Skull Inn that evening while she took over for him at Warmfires.</p>
