<p>Jarull Cartcoster was a young man of Yhaunn who fell afoul of a Sharran plot in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jarull was a large, powerfully built man. His orcish ancestry granted him heavier features and a grayish cast to his skin.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jarull's paternal grandmother was an orc, and his half-orc father had died early in his life on a foolish adventure. His only remaining family member was his mother Hane , who was perpetually worried that her son would also meet a poor end. He paid no heed to her worries.</p>
<p>He met Keph Thingoleir as a teenager, and the two of them became inseparable friends who caroused and brawled across the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR he voluntarily joined the secretive Temple of Shar , only to be held prisoner by Variance Amatick , who tortured him and denied him food and water. In this time, Variance stole his identity and used his persona to manipulate Keph into joining the cult and falling under her influence.</p>
<p>While he was missing from home, his mother had Keph arrested and interrogated on suspicion of his involvement, and had Strasus Thingoleir attempt to magically divine his location, to no effect.</p>
<p>When Keph refused to have any more dealings with the cult, Variance revealed the real Jarull and used him as a hostage to ensure Keph would continue serving her interests.</p>
<p>Jarull was finally rescued by Guard Captain Manas after two tendays, physically and mentally broken. He was then sent to the temple of Ilmater for treatment and recovery.</p>
