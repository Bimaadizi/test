<p>The Oathbreaker Knight was a supernatural figure who appeared before those paladins of the Realms who tarnished, broke, or even completely abandoned the oaths they made in life. He was once a mortal knight himself, before he was called to greater service.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Oathbreaker Knight wore a set of filgreed full plate armor, that featured interlocking, spiked plates and claw-like gauntlets. A blood-red cape was draped over his shoulders.</p>
<p>The knight's body—if even one still existed—was entirely shrouded by his armor. The eye slits in his helm revealed no portion of his face, rather fiery orange light and green smoke that radiated outward from within.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a stoic figure that did not necessarily judge the paladins before whom he presented himself. He remained objective in his dealings, merely noting misdeeds and crimes that were committed, along with their corresponding consequences.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Oathbreaker Knight was a fearsome combatant, one that possessed tremendous strength and undeniable charisma. When appearing before a mortal, he could grow to nearly twice his size, and conjure darkness and ethereal flames upon his body at will.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded a massive, enchanted greatsword .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>At times, paladins strayed from their divine purpose, whether to uphold righteous justice or defend the natural world. It was on those occasions the Oathbreaker Knight would appear. The knight would offer them a choice: repent and make right their transgression, or embrace the path of darkness . For those paladins that erred in judgement but wished to keep true to their oaths, the Oathbreaker Knight could reforge their oaths. For paladins who broke their oath for the first time, the Oathbreaker Knight charged a fee of 1,000 gold pieces to reforge the oath. If the oath was broken a second time, the fee rose to 2,000 gold pieces.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Oathbreaker Knight was once a mortal man who served a noble-born lord. He fought dutifully, raising his blade wherever directed. Over time the knight slew thousands in his lord's name, destroying whole communities in the name of some greater good. The Oathbreaker Knight's unwavering loyalty clouded his judgement and blinded him to the grave injustices they had committed.</p>
<p>Clarity finally arrived in the knight's mind, but unfortunately, it was some time too late. He tried to reason with his lord, but to no avail. The knight cut down his lord where he stood, finally and completely breaking the oath he had previously sworn. He understood the consequences that others would face if his lord was allowed to continue far outweighed those that he would alone come to bear.</p>
