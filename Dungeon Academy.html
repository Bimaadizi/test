<p>The Dungeon Academy was a secret school for monsters located in the Star Mounts .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Dungeon Academy was located in the Star Mounts . Specifically, Akhellon Ridge in the Veiled Mountains , which were in the Endless Woods . It was 10 miles (16 kilometers) from Horntree Village .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Dungeon Academy was an old building. Some parts of it were in poor condition. The first floor of the Academy was designed around a central corridor. Beneath that floor were the 'dungeon levels' for classes and other activities. The floors were connected by a large spiral staircase. Below, the Academy was connected to volcanic pools of magma. It had over eight subterranean floors in total, descending to caverns that were off-limits to students. The lowest floors held the secret</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Academy was filled with bats and old traps . Some parts smelled bad. while others were freezing cold. A large pendulum in the corridor was used to help mark the time. Some corridors were lined with chests , for students to use as storage. Some notable areas included:</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Academy trained young monsters in the ways of being monsters before they graduated and were ultimately sent out to dungeons . Students were organized into grades, of which there were at least six. Classes taught in the academy included: Advanced Sneakcraft and Skulkery, Bartering, Common Creatures and Crawlers, Ghostly Groaning and Other Unsettling Noises, History of Horrible Humans, How to Befoul and Offend, Introduction to Hoarding, Intro to Skulking, Taking Care of Your Hoard and something called PE.</p>
<p>Classes were held in semesters. Some classes were known to issue homework, in the form of essays. Students were also sometimes sent out into the outside world to practice what they had learnt. Some students organized in clubs, such as the Lurking Club . Students whose parents were employed by the Academy stayed on school premises. Students also took the summer off to return to their families. The Academy celebrated Baneday and held a Mid- Never Winter break.</p>
<p>The Academy had a particularly strong school spirit, which manifested in support for their goreball team, the Dungeon Academy Flumphs . The Flumphs, named for the school mascot of the flumph , had an ongoing rivalry with the superior Waterdeep Dragons team from the Waterdeep School for Dragons . The Flumphs were extremely inferior to their rivals. Bullying was rampant at the school. . This included scratching offending messages on other students' property, such as "BEWARE THE FART KING".</p>
<p>The rules of the school were outlined in The Dungeon Academy student handbook . The Academy had banned all forms of undead and necromancy along with it. The demilich Professor Gast was the only undead allowed on school premises. Even spells like withering touch were not allowed at school. Kindness was also banned, and when exhibited, punishable by detention. Different professors took turns monitoring students in detention. The Academy had a school council that held votes to decide on school policies.</p>
<p>The Academy had an exchange program with slaadi from the plane of Limbo . It participated the Tourney of Terror , a goreball tournament held every 50 years. During the Tourney, classes were suspended.</p>
<p>There was also a yearbook that assigned students positions such as 'least likely to change'.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The academy was secret and well defended. The Endless Woods, which surrounded the mountains in which the academy was located, only allowed passage to those that it deemed worthy, such as students of the Academy. It was also protected by the Nexus Marker , which existed below the school in the Akhellon Ridge . The Nexus Marker interacted with magical energies of three intersecting leylines and a rich deposit of diamonds and surrounded the school with a huge protective field that prevented teleportation and other magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mountainous location of the academy had previously been the lair of the blue dragon Akhellon , from whom it got the name Akhellon Ridge. Some time after she left, a clan of kobolds laired there, and then a necromantic order of wizards . Adventurers explored the natural caves, seeking the Nexus Marker , and the Academy was eventually built there.</p>
<p>The Academy was originally a school that included dragons among its other monstrous students. Impro Vice , Zxaticus , Noggin and Needler and Cedaver had been students there. They eventually inherited the school operations and became teachers. But Zxaticus and Cedaver had a series of intense disagreements, some related to Cedaver's advisor Elgred Morbide . A schism occurred, and Cedaver left to found the Waterdeep School for Dragons .</p>
<p>The Academy had existed for over 300 years. Its school mascot had previously been a bulette , until 200 years ago it was changed to the flumph after a bulette attack.</p>
<p>The human barbarian Mad Smithy had in the past tried to take the Academy. He died in the process, but his greataxe remained as the pendulum for the clock in the corridor on the first floor.</p>
<p>One winter, the necromancer Lord Carrion used magic to take control of some students who had been sent on an excursion to Horntree Village. He led some of the students, along with some villagers, through a portal. He was stopped by the newly formed Danger Club and the adventurer Allidora Steelstrike . Carrion was kept as a prisoner at the academy</p>
<p>Months later, the Tourney of Terror was held in the Academy. Carrion escaped, and threatened the school. In response, Dean Zxaticus moved the student population to outdoor tents and continued with the tournament. But the tournament was attacked by skeletons and undead treants . Carrion escaped with his ally Elgred Morbide through a portal. The tournament was suspended, the Waterdeep Dragons were declared winners, and the students spent the night outdoors while the staff searched the school for the necromancers. In the abandoned chambers of the old school, The Danger Club faced off against Carrion and Elgred Morbide, who revealed themselves to be servants of the dracolich An'Kizhek . Morbide escaped through a portal, escaping with the keystone of the Nexus Marker , abandoning Carrion. Without the barrier created by the Marker, the school was undefended. Zxaticus and Cedaver put some of their differences aside to protect their students.</p>
