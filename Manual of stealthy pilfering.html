<p>A manual of stealthy pilfering was a powerful magical tome that could take a thief to new heights of ability.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Manuals of stealthy pilfering were bound in black hide.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A rogue or bard who read the manual found that the text disappeared after reading, but if they practiced the skills detailed within for one month they were magically instilled with the experience they needed to take their sneaking, pilfering, and skulduggery skills to the next level and then a bit further. They could not benefit from reading the manual a second time.</p>
<p>Fighters and wizardss were unable to understand a word of the manual . Clerics , paladins and rangers who dared steal a glance at the contents found their minds assailed with damaging concepts, stunned and helpless as their high-handed experiences melted away. If they did not receive an atonement within a day, they also suffered a permanent damage to their common-sense and judgment.</p>
