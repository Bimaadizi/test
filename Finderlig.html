<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Finderlig considered himself a realistic and busy duergar. He believed that outsiders only caused problems, and informed Gorion's Ward that many others in the Underdark shared his beliefs. He did, however, wish Gorion's Ward and his party the best of luck in their journeys.</p>
