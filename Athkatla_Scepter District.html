<p>The Scepter District was an exclusive ward of Athkatla , home to the city's most wealthy, aristocratic families. Some of these rich mercantile houses owned magnificent sprawling estates within the district, some of which were the size of several city blocks. The scepter district was located in the southwest portion of Athkatla, along the Sea of Swords , walled off from the Center District . The Olemandur Gate led southward out of the city.</p>
<p>No Athkatlans of common birth were welcome within the Scepter district unless they were performing errands or tasks for residents who lived within its walls.</p>
