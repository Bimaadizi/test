<p>The Cliffside Cranny was a hole in Luskan's wall created by an earthquake that occurred around 1460 DR . The cranny was assessable by foot or boat and served as an unofficial city gate. In 1480 DR the cranny was guarded by Waterdavian guardsmen assigned to keep plague victims from leaving Luskan.</p>
