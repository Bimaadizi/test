<p>The bakery was owned by Urda Malo . When she reached advanced and frail years, she hired several assistants from among the local Evenor women. Her "daughters" helped run the business up until Urda became senile and unable to manage the business. While the Evenor women ran the bakery, they also took care of Urda up until her death. After that, they took over the Eveningstar Bakery and as of the late-15 th century DR, the children continued Urda's business.</p>
