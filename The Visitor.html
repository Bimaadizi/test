<p>The Visitor was a mysterious man who managed to infiltrate and escape Temple Darkmoon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Visitor was described to be, after his escape from Darkmoon, covered in mud and drained of strength. His clothes were soaked in blood, and his skin covered in burns and bite marks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , little was known of the evil Darkmoon temple until the Visitor informed the locals that he had been there. After leaving the temple, the man slammed on the door of a tavern in Waterdeep . The locals aided the wounded man back to health the best they could, and examined his numerous burn marks and bite wounds.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the Visitor became wild and irrational. He spoke of armies of undead from Darkmoon, and the conquering of Waterdeep. He started to ramble on about the history of Darkmoon, and the leader, Dran Draggore , as well as the dark elf minions.</p>
<p>Strangely, the Visitor left a few nights later, leaving a book and a note. The note just was a letter of thanks to the patrons who had aided him, but the book he had left contained many secrets about the evil temple. He requested it to be delivered to Khelben Arunsun , so that he could put an end to Darkmoon. Khelben later dispatched the Heroes of Waterdeep to take down the evils that lay inside the obscure temple.</p>
