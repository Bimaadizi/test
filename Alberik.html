<p>Alberik was the captain of the guards at the path leading to Adama's Tooth , posted by the Datharathi to protect the access to their mine. In 1374 DR , he allowed Eined Datharathi into the mine despite being under standing orders not to let anyone in, as he had not been notified her family wanted her captured. Alongside her, he allowed in Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor . The man had been a part to the indiscretions of the Datharathi heiress around the year 1369 DR , which made it more likely for him to take her statements at face value.</p>
