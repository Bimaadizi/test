<p>A cloak of fangs was an enchanted item that shot darts of force.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A cloak of fangs could be used as a regular all-weather cloak for any length of time, but its magic could only be used once when the command word "Feerond" was uttered. The magic of the cloak would release a continuous spray of invisible darts of force in all directions for seven minutes that would strike and harm any target within 3 feet (0.91 meters) of the wearer. The cloak would vanish forever after the darts ceased firing.</p>
