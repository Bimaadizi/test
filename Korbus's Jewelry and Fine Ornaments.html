<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located on the southern side of Daggerford's Money Quarter at the junction of the Trade Way , High Road , and Water Street .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>While the shop itself was only one story, there were gnomish living quarters within its basement.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Korbus crafted all manner of ornamental jewelry, from the usual earrings and bracelets to even bejeweled belts and bracers . While it was believed beauty of these pieces were enhanced by means of his magical abilities, his trinkets could not be detected by magic .</p>
<p>His custom pieces were in high demand among the wealthy Waterdhavian merchants, and even those individuals that worked for the city's masked lords .</p>
<p>Additionally, Korbus offered services of identification and appraisal for the small fee of 10 gp per piece examined.</p>
