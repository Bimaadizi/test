<p>Longswords were an extremely common and very versatile variety of sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The design and length of longswords varied between cultures, they could even vary within the same culture depending upon the era. For example, those made in Shou Lung often had a butterfly-shaped tip. However, the length of longswords generally ranged between 35​ to ​47 inches (0.89​ to ​1.2 meters).</p>
<p>Most longswords had a double-edged blade, though some had a single-edged blade, with a sharp point at their tip. They often had grooves known as "fullers" that ran the length of their blade, one on each surface, that made the blade both lighter and more flexible.</p>
<p>Most long swords had an ovaloid metal plate between the blade's base and grip, protecting the latter from getting damaged against the metal in the mouth of a sheath , in addition to offering the user's hand some protection. A second plate of metal, either circular or ovaloid in shape, would also be fitted on to the pommel.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Longswords were primarily designed for attacking opponents by slashing at them with the edges of its blade. Opinions varied on the feasibility or viability of dual-wielding longswords. Many eladrin rangers were seen to perform this feat.</p>
