<p>Bearpaw was an immensely strong and affable ranger who lived in northwest Faerûn some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bearpaw was a sort of man who made friends and earned respect wherever he went. During his time patrolling the Cloakwood Forest , to everyone's surprise, Bearpaw befriended a strangely benevolent ogre . This friendship earned the ranger a massive enchanted composite longbow called the Strong Arm . The weapon could only be wielded by a person of great physical strength, but luckily, Bearpaw was very strong. When the ranger died, his sons were unable to draw the longbow's bowstring . The best one son was able to do was to draw it halfway. Unable to use it, Bearpaw's wife sold the Strong Arm to a merchant traveling south. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the weapon ended up in the capital of Amn , Athkatla ..</p>
