<p>The Court of the Three was the self-proclaimed successor to Returned Netheril founded following the death of Lord Telamont Tanthul and the destruction of Thultanthar . It was named for its leaders— Lelavdra Tanthul , Manarlume Tanthul , and Gwelt —who referred to themselves collectively as the Three .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Three were ambitious and specialized in subterfuge, but in the short-term, they aimed to create a refuge for their fellow Thultanthan survivors. Their stated goal was to bring together Shadovar and to preserve Thultanthan culture in the face of the many foes that Returned Netheril had amassed. To this end, they advocated for a much more subtle presence than their predecessors, keeping to themselves and focusing on avoiding and identifying enemies while finding new allies. They sought out fellow Thultanthans and tried to integrate them into their faction, sometimes with manipulation or seduction.</p>
<p>While the Three claimed specifically to be the rightful heirs to Thultanthar, their future ambitions extended to the surviving cities of Returned Netheril and (perhaps) to conquest.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Court of the Three operated out of the Citadel of the Raven , specifically from one of the most well-maintained of its ruined fortresses. There they received new recruits and amassed supplies. They kept their activities magically concealed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Court of the Three had many enemies, and largely regarded all of Toril as hostile or potentially hostile to them.</p>
<p>They kept a close eye on the activities of the Zhentarim , especially once they too began efforts to reclaim parts of the Citadel of the Raven. Hidden by their magics, the Three used deception, manipulation, and assassination to keep the unknowing Zhents in check.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the fall of Thultanthar in the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , Lord Telamont Tanthul was dead and his princes were dead or missing. In this power vacuum, the Three came together and declared themselves the rightful heirs to that city: sisters Lelavdra and Manarlume were both granddaughters of Lord Telamont, and thus claimed rulership as their birthright, while the arcanist Gwelt had been a trusted lieutenant of Lord Tanthul, who had granted him extraordinary powers of command. Declaring themselves to be fast friends and allies—if not lovers—the Three agreed that the Princes of Shade had been foolish and prideful, and so designed their Court of the Three to avoid falling into the same trap.</p>
<p>From their base at the Citadel of the Raven, Gwelt ranged out to find and convince fellow Shadovar to join the Three's cause while the sisters used their wiles to cement the loyalty of the most critical new recruits. While their recruiting efforts were more successful than they had anticipated, a large number of arcanists rejected them, preferring not to follow a new master but to pursue their own ambitions.</p>
<p>As the stresses of leadership mounted, it was unclear whether the avowed friendship between the Three would last.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>By late 1487 DR, the Three had managed to rally about sixty Shadovar arcanists to their cause, largely of lower ranks. Additionally, they had been joined by twenty non-Shadovar former Thultanthans.</p>
