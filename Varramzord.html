<p>Varramzord , also known as Varram the White , was a male gold dwarf and the White Dragon Wyrmspeaker in the reformed Cult of the Dragon under Severin Silrajin .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Owing to his past experience, Varram hated the Red Wizards of Thay and despised the fact that Severin had allied with them. Varram was one of Severin's best friends, but had a weak personality and greatly feared the wrath of Severin. He could be easily convinced to betray the Cult in exchange for his personal protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Varram was captured by pirates during a trip across the Sea of Fallen Stars and sold as a slave to the Red Wizards of Thay. He managed to escape but retained a great hate for the Thayan wizards.</p>
<p>During the Tyranny of Dragons , a very competent Zhentarim thief stole Varram's white dragon mask and in fear of punishment from Severin he secretly traveled from the Cult's stronghold of the Well of Dragons to the Tomb of Diderius —the site of a powerful divination pool—in order to find the mask's location. However, in the Serpent Hills , Varram was captured by a yuan-ti clan.</p>
<p>Eventually an adventuring band opposed to the Cult rescued Varram in order to extract information from him.</p>
