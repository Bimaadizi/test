<p>Lord Leander Gist was a patriar of Baldur's Gate sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lord Gist was a portly snowy-bearded man, wrapped in layers of heavy and expensive satins and a frumpy hat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a portrait of Leander Gist painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. The picture aggressively yelled at observers, "Bastard bog goblin ! Get out!" Other copies of the same painting were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate.</p>
