<p>Pipe organs were unmovably huge and the most complex and of all musical instruments , consisting of a system of metal tubes, wooden shafts, usually controlled by two sets of keyboards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These huge and stationary instruments consisted of hundreds of metallic pipes that rose up from the organ's body. These vertical tubes varied in length, from a mere 0 feet and 1 inch (0.025 meters) to as tall as 32 feet (9.8 meters). Some of the pipes were controlled by upright wooden shafts and clogs that gave produced sounds increased tonal depth and range. The sounds were produced via a set of sizable bellows that pushed the air through the sounding pipes. The music was controlled via sets of keyboards (two to five), and each could be set to imitate different instruments or even a combination. The keyboard's connection to pipes and the produced sound was controlled by a set of pedals, or steps, that allowed the air to travel from bellows to a particular set of pipes.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>Pipe organs were considered to be the height of ingenuity and musical art. The instrument's numerous pipes and keyboards allowed for the widest range of sound compared to other instruments and even among their close relative instruments such as harpsichords . The pitch varied depending on the pipe's size. Smaller ones produced higher-pitched music and vice versa . Some exceptional pipe organs had pipes so large, their sounds were imperceptible by humans , and pipes so diminutive that only tiny animals could perceive their music. When the player stroke multiple keyboards at the same time, the organ produced a multitude of chords.</p>
<h3>Operation</h3>
<p>The organ player was positioned directly in front of the instrument after setting the stops directing the airflow from bellows to the pipes. In order to operate the ingenious instrument, bellows needed to be pushed through the entire performance. Some pipe organs had a pedal just for that operated by the player, but most, especially the bigger instruments, required at least one assistant.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1364 DR , a Harper agent Danilo Thann and the rogue elf Elaith Craulnober encountered a strange pipe organ assembled out of reeds on their way to Taskerleigh . The strange organ tuned itself to music and caused the surrounding swamp reeds to dance to the melody. The music echoed from the opposite side of the swamp. The music reached a crescendo in a loud and deep blast of sound similar to a hunting horn . These organs served to alert a tribe of bullywugs who dwelt in the murky depths of the bog.</p>
<p>Sometime after 1485 DR , a gargantuan coral pipe organ belonged to the storm giants of Malestrom , the stronghold at the bottom of the Trackless Sea .</p>
<p>During the Descent of 1492 DR , the magnificent ivory -keyed pipe organ of Elturel's High Hall , along with the entire city was transported into Avernus and back to Toril after suffering from relentless fiendish attacks on the castle.</p>
<h2>Notable Pipe Organs</h2>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Pipe organs were often most appreciated by human communities; however, because of their size, price, and complexity, only the most wealthy could afford them. Various hoarding dragons also knew the value of such instruments. Pipe organs were known to end up among priceless treasures in dragons' lairs.</p>
