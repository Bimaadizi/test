<p>A verdant shield was a type of buckler used in the Utter East during the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>These vine-wrapped wooden shields were associated with the wilderness and hence protected the user from attacks by creatures of nature. Furthermore, they were immune to the seductive lure of nymphs and the wail of local banshees .</p>
