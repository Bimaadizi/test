<p>Insurance , also known as surety , was a means of protecting from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, one party agreed to compensate another in the event of a contingent loss, damage, or injury. This service could be found in the cities of Baldur's Gate , Ravens Bluff , and Waterdeep , as well as to a lesser extent all over the Heartlands , along the trade routes of the Sword Coast , and parts of Wildspace . The entity who provided insurance was called either an insurer or underwriter, while the one buying it was referred to as the policyholder.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When buying insurance, the person or entity receives a written contract, presided over at a temple, called a "performance bond" or "insurance policy". This transaction was most often presided over within a Waukeenar temple. These contracts detailed the conditions and circumstances under which an insurer had to compensate the insured.</p>
<p>In Faer√ªn the insurers of these policies were moneylenders , some guilds , and increasingly over time governments and rulers. In some instances there existed businesses centered around this service, known as insurance companies. Government-issued performance bonds were provided to adventurers , costers , or guilds willing to undertake a risky task on behalf of the insuring ruler.</p>
<p>There existed a wide variety of insurance types, each devoted to providing protection against the loss or injury of a specific thing or in a specific manner. These ranged from particular items of property, vehicles like ships and spelljammers , the cargo on a ship, buildings, limbs, or even the death of a specific person. Fire bonds were surety for houses that obligated a guarantor to either put out a house fire or, more often, compensate for any lost goods. Tumbledown surety, also known as "windstorm surety", compelled an insurer in the cases of a building collapsing to pay for the construction of a new one and the compensation of all property. Theft insurance could protect a sailing ship from suffering a financial loss from piracy or dockside pilferage. And spoilage insurance could protect a ship from the financial loss of perishables going bad due to unforeseeable time delays, like dockworkers striking, bureaucratic port delays, or long periods without wind. However, performance bonds could not cover every unforeseeable form of loss, and it was up to buyers to be savvy of what coverage they might need.</p>
<p>For insurers, there was sometimes a risk of policyholders trying to defraud them, such as burning down their own insured building. When insurers have reason to suspect foul play was at work, they would hire investigators to prove the validity of their claims. A plaintiff might even have to submit themselves to magical scrutiny in order to prove their innocence.</p>
