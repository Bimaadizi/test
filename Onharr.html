<p>Onharr the Scalebright was the enchanter owner of a famed lavish festhall Serpentspires in the pre- Weeping War Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Serpentspires held Onharr's livelihood and his passion, most were reduced to rubble or buried deep in the cellars of the half-destroyed festhall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Onharr the Scalebright was a renowned wizard and enchanter from Myth Drannor who was told to have silver dragon blood running through his veins.</p>
<p>In 714 DR , during the last days of the Weeping War, the Army of Darkness broke through the city's barriers and swarmed over Cormanthyr . Onharr decided to stay and defend his Serpentspires. A powerful mezzoloth Yekschanivosk , the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls, faced off against Onharr the Scalebright, blasting the festhall open in the spell-slinging duel. It was believed that both Onharr and Yekschanivosk perished in the battle, even though there were theories that the mezzoloth was not banished, but instead trapped within a gemstone lost somewhere in the ruins of Serpentspires.</p>
