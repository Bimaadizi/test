<p>A jump dagger was a seemingly mundane dagger that possessed three magical abilities.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon grasping the blade, it affected the wielder with a constant feather fall –like effect.</p>
<p>The wielder could also, at-will, jump into the air as per the spell jump . Doing so would negate the feather fall effect.</p>
<p>By pointing the dagger, the wielder could also move a certain, small, nonliving object, under 3' in diameter and 100 lbs in weight, up to 30' away.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>One of the crafting methods of a jump dagger required the use of the spells feather fall , jump , and levitate along with a specific method of tempering. The oil used in this process contained the blood of a blink dog or displacer beast or the ichor of a beholder .</p>
<p>Another method involved the use of jump and mage hand spells.</p>
