<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith followed Marlel into the Stormy Tankard in 1357Â DR , they briefly overheard a woman from behind a curtain calling for the next. A man responded with "Fraea", strongly implying that was her name; she responded by demanding four gold pieces, strongly implying that was the price for some service. He asked to confirm the price, and she said it would be five if she disputed with him, strongly implying the price was set by her. Shandril and Narm left in a different direction within the inn, and did not see the rest of the exchange.</p>
