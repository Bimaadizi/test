<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the hobgoblin forebears of Razor Heart served the succubus demon lord Soneillon . When she was banished from Toril because of the Spellplague , she left behind the two Crowns of Whispers and the Greatsword of Impiltur , which were claimed by her former servants. One of the Crowns as well as the Greatsword both came into the possession of the Razor Heart tribe.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, under the leadership of their queen, Maaqua , the Razor Heart tribe managed to establish ties with Damara , granting it a veneer of legitimate rule and enabling it to charge a tax on travelers along the Long Road through the Giantspire Gap. At the same time, the tribe was steadily expanding throughout the Giantspires by assimilating other goblinoid tribes. Their greatest resistance came from the Black Wolf tribe, whose Chief Aruugan possessed the other Crown of Whispers .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The queen of the Razor Heart tribe was Maaqua as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . It was a mixed tribe of not only hobgoblins, but goblins , ogres , and even giants .</p>
