<p>Sumitomo Tomy was a master chef and first owner of the renowned Doi No Fugu , an inn in Maeshi Province on Shinkoku , Kozakura , early in that nation's history.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hailing from Maeshi Province and a family of master chefs, Tomy started his career as an apprentice chef at an inn located in another province, the famed Nami No Hana , or the Crest of the Wave.</p>
<p>The newly ascended Emperor Akimatsu Mori decided to stay at the Nami No Hana on the night following the battle of Kyoki in Kozakuran Year 1 (−73 DR) . However, the master chef there was brother to a slain soldier of the army defeated at Kyoki and wanted revenge. The chef prepared the first emperor's celebratory dinner—the house specialty, raw tiger fugu and daikon ( radish ) sculpted to resemble a flying crane—with the poisonous fugu liver mixed in with the radish sauce on the crane's crest. But Tomy spotted something off with the food as it was served, rushed past the guards, and stopped Mori before he could take the deadly bite. The would-be poisoner was invited to dine with the emperor, and forced to eat his own cooking.</p>
<p>Afterward, Emperor Mori offered to elevate Tomy to noble status in recognition and gratitude, but Tomy explained that all Sumitomos were master chefs and changing his status would be a dishonor to the previous generations. He only wanted to finish his training as a chef and maybe one day own his own kitchen, as the founder of the Sumitomo family had dreamed for one of his descendants. The emperor understood and departed but later still wanted to give a recompense to the valorous and modest Tomy. He felt the land needed more chefs than daimyos anyway.</p>
<p>Therefore, the very day that Tomy finished his training, he was surprisingly arrested by a company of imperial soldiers at the emperor's command. They escorted him to Maeshi Province, Tomy's home, where the emperor had decreed the construction of two new roads and a grand new inn at their crossing. Outside, the captain of the company gave the keys to the bemused Tomy and explained the emperor had granted him proprietorship of the new inn and marked him as a master chef. Moreover, the inn would be always protected by an imperial decree punishing anyone who harmed the owner or violated its hospitality with a death sentence, and the Sumitomos would not have to pay taxes. Tomy named his new inn Doi no Fugu, "Inn of the Globefish", after the incident and went to work.</p>
<p>A year after, on the anniversary of the battle of Kyoki, Emperor Mori went to eat a dish of fugu prepared by Tomy.</p>
<p>Since that time, Sumitomo Tomy endeavored to establish Doi no Fugu's reputation as a place of peace and the inn prospered. He became one of the greatest chefs of Kozakura and even nobles of court followed the emperor's example in journeying to Maeshi Province simply to dine at Doi no Fugu.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>After Tomy's death, ownership of the inn remained in the Sumitomo family, passed from father to eldest son down through the centuries and the generations. Tomy had instituted a rule that the eldest son and any family member who would become a chef must be sent away to undertake his apprenticeship elsewhere, not with their parents at the inn. This was so they would learn and bring back new cooking techniques, saving the menu at Doi No Fugu ever growing stale.</p>
<p>The tale of Tomy and Mori was related in a stylized noh play titled " The Reward of Tomy ", which would later be performed at the inn.</p>
