<p>An Ollamh harp ( pronounced : /ˈ ɑː l l ɑː m / AL-lam ) was a masterwork magic harp and the most powerful of the Instruments of the Bards .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ollamh harps were superior in every way to ordinary harps. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards , and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bards wielding an Ollamh harp had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic, in the same way that Anstruth harps did.</p>
<p>Like all Instruments of the Bards, these harps had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing an Ollamh harp could invoke the spells fly , invisibility , levitate , protection from evil and good , confusion , control weather and fire storm each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first Ollamh harps were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . He used them to test and reward the students of the Ollamh level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.</p>
<p>Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.</p>
