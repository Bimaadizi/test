<p>For unknown reasons, the young Chaathuuladroth destroyed Nezram's tower and looted it for treasure, killing or driving off most of the wizard's descendants; the powerful Nezram himself was not living in the tower at this time. Chaathuuladroth then carried off most of Nezram's treasures away somewhere to the west.</p>
