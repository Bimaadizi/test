<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , shortly before the armies of the Cult of the Absolute attacked the city of Baldur's Gate, Lady Winstra Hullhollyn was a Parliamentarian of the Gate and voted in support of crowning lowborn Lord Enver Gortash as the city's Archduke. Lady Hullhollyn was present for Gortash's coronation that took place in the audience hall of Wyrm's Rock . Following the coronation, Lady Winstra Hullhollyn conversed with a fellow Parliamentarian Lord Randolf Vammas , lamenting cancelations of social events die to the armies of the Absolute advancing on the Gate. She believed that the new Archduke would be a more fun leader and a charismatic, unlike boring old Ulder Ravengard .</p>
