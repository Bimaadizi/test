<p>Malasarr's Wayhouse Inn was a ramshackle inn located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inn consisted of a number of different homes, stores, and stables linked together with shabby catwalks and stairs. The rooms were sparsely decorated with a simple cot and lantern. A single outdoor privy was provided for the entire compound.</p>
<p>Each room featured a doorbar for security, but criminals had been known to simply break through the thin walls to rob guests.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Malasarr's Wayhouse Inn was attractive only to travelers on an extremely tight budget since rooms could be had for only four coppers a night. Meals were not included with that price, but washwater was sent to the rooms.</p>
