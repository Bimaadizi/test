<h2>Lair</h2>
<p>Larendrammagar had a lair in the Galena Mountains , and it was rumored that he also had another lair in the Desertsmouth Mountains .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was 500 years old, Larendrammagar dedicated his life to the study of magic, and over the years developed most of the unique spells only dragons could cast.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , when Lareth convened a conclave in the Galena Mountains to inform the metallic dragons of the incoming Rage of Dragons , Larendrammagar devised a spell that would bind them to sleep until the Rage subsided. He also put his friend Protanther to sleep , to protect him from the ravages of the Rage.</p>
<p>When Lareth and his lieutenant Tamarand challenged each other over whether to help humanoid races against the Rage, Larendrammagar was awoken from his sleep to be one of the witnesses of the duel, the other being the captain of the Talons of Justice , Havarlan .</p>
<p>After the duel, Larendrammagar agreed to help Dorn Graybrook and his companions in researching the Dracorage mythal . Using lore from the Monastery of the Yellow Rose , the great wyrm managed to reconstruct the elven high magic rite used to curse dragonkind and devise a counterspell that would wipe the enchantment away, but only if cast in the right place.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Sammaster , who had used an ancient elven citadel as his headquarters, Larendrammagar completed the allied force's victory by casting a potent spell of banishment that returned the Sammaster dragon allies to their native planes of existence.</p>
<p>After the last Dracorage, he and Tamarand helped the Talons of Justice in some of their missions. Their last mission was to help the Talons locate a former member of the order who had become a rebel, the dragon Arendelonthos .</p>
