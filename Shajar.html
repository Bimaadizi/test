<p>Shajar was the savage god of the Nogaro River in east Zakhara , depicted with the head of a hippopotamus , and was the consort of Ragarra .</p>
<p>Largely forgotten after the fall of the ancient kingdom of Nog and the rise of Enlightenment , his worship was continued by secret cults scattered throughout the Cities of the Ancients area. As the embodiment of the great Nogaro, Shajar represented both its benevolent, life-giving qualities and the destructive character present during the river's recurring floods. Thus the deity was called upon at births and deaths.</p>
<p>The greatest relic of his cult was the Talisman of Shajar .</p>
