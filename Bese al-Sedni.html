<p>Bese al-Sedni was a marid who inhabited Huzuz , the City of Delights, in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Bese was tasked with helping incoming ships to the Trade Harbor find their docks. He hated his job but knew that to disobey his master would have dire consequences. The only joy he found was in the form of particularly wild sea rides to the docks, usually at the expense of foreigners, since any complaint they made would be ignored.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bese was bound in service to Sardi al-Danafi as a gift from his parents. The term of his contract was 100 years plus a day. As of 1367 DR, he still had many decades left of servitude.</p>
