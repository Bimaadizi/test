<p>Lord Sunang was a ruler in Kara-Tur in the midâ€“12th century DR .</p>
<p>When the forces of a mighty wu-jen laid siege to his lands, Lord Sunang was forced to make alliances and purchase magical weapons, such as the blade of the elements , which was designed to slay elementals . However, this strategy proved very costly: Sunang was near-bankrupted and his influence waned, while his enemy continued to grow in power. Ultimately, Sunang's realm collapsed from its own weaknesses, not to conquest. It was supposed that the profit-hungry merchants supplied arms to both sides, but proof was lost to history.</p>
