<p>Palisade, the Ward of Karliath was a powerful magical large shield found in the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shield was generated from unholy energy into a form of steel and dragonscale , but in a peculiar twist of fate it took the appearance of a typical relic of Myth Drannor; an ornate silvery elven shield decorated with leafy designs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Palisade's powers were drawn from the red dragon dracolich Karliath . It made the bearer much more durable and resilient, and absorbed any curses thrown their way. It also gave them a touch of supernatural mobility, letting them dodge more easily even in heavy armor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This shield was created as a by-product of the necromantic rituals and undead energies tied to the dracolich Karliath. It may have been found by the Elves of Cormanthor when they raided the Cult of the Dragon base in Myth Drannor that was later taken over by the Red Wizards of Kathul Sep , who sought to enslave the dracolich.</p>
