<p>Gnomengarde was a tunnel network located in the Sword Mountains that was home to a small kingdom of reclusive rock gnomes famous for their magical inventions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The settlement was carved out of the sheer cliffs on either side of a narrow waterfall. This fed a pool in which sat two small islands covered in 2‑foot-tall (0.61‑meter) blue, green, and purple mushrooms . The mist and roar of the waterfall blanketed and hid the area from outsiders, but also emanated into the Gnomengarde cave network. Gnomes inside the echoing tunnels had to shout to be heard over the noise unless they had a door or barrier between themselves and the waterfall, and most of said doors had rusted likely because of the waterfall's mists. The tunnels themselves were quite spacious for a gnome, averaging 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide and 7 feet (2.1 meters) high, and were well-lit by lantern light.</p>
<p>The clan of gnomes who called Gnomengarde home lived quite simply, with simple furniture and amenities made of wood. The exception was their kings, whose bedchambers was richly appointed and whose thrones had been crafted from scrap metal. Most of the larger spaces in the tunnel network were dedicated to food and alcohol preparation or to workshop spaces.</p>
<p>The entire area was a zone of wild magic .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Gnomengarde was located in the north-facing slopes of the Sword Mountains about 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Phandalin .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Gnomengarde was ruled by King Gnerkli and his husband, King Korboz . The gnomes also looked up to and tended to heed the words of whomever was the best of their inventors, and at this time these were Fibblestib and Dabbledob .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The residents of Gnomengarde were consummate tinkerers and crafters of magic items, which were the main draw for outsiders looking to do business with the gnomes. Such items included clockwork amulets , hats of wizardry , poles of collapsing , and wands of pyrotechnics .</p>
<p>The gnomes were largely self-sufficient thanks to the special types of red, green, and purple mushrooms that grew on the islands in the pool beneath their waterfall: the red mushrooms could be processed into fuel for lanterns and mechanical devices using a complex pressing contraption devised by the gnomes, the green mushrooms could be pulverized into a flour which could be kneaded and baked into bread , and the purple mushrooms could be fermented inside barrels to make mushroom wine .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Two sentries stood watch on a ledge overlooking the only approach to Gnomengarde. The settlement was naturally defended by the fact that its cave entrances were located 30 feet (9.1 meters) above the ground within sheer cliffs, and the tunnels were difficult to access for anyone unaware of the single narrow footpath on the northeast side of the waterfall. Ascending this path granted access to the kitchen and dining areas, but to go deeper into the caves required getting past an omnidirectional autoloading crossbow platform operated by the device's mad creator, Facktoré . Any invader would then need to cross a rope bridge above the waterfall and navigate a room containing two large rotating blade traps operated from the opposite side of the room.</p>
<p>In addition to these physical defenses, every member of the community had some training as a wizard . They all studied from the same old spellbook, called Magick of Gnomengarde .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The founders of Gnomengarde imbued the islands in the pool beneath the waterfall with potent magics that caused unique colorful and large mushrooms to grow there, which would serve as the backbone of the settlement's livelihood. Perhaps unintentionally, these magics also created a wild magic zone around the caves.</p>
<p>Around the time of Phandalin's refounding in the late 15 th century DR, Gnomengarde was home to twenty-two gnomes. A few years later, a mimic arrived in the settlement and developed a taste for gnome flesh, killing and consuming at least two of the inhabitants and nearly killing King Korboz. The attack shook the king so thoroughly that he went mad, imprisoning his husband and himself inside their bedchamber to wait until the shapechanger either grew bored of eating their subjects or was driven off. Around this time, the Townmaster of Phandalin, Harbin Wester , made overtures to the gnomes for magic items to assist in driving off the white dragon Cryovain .</p>
<p>Not long after this incident, the town of Leilon asked Gnomengarde for magic weapons with which to defend themselves from the green dragon Claugiyliamatar . In response, the gnomes invented the Gnomengarde grenade .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>During the incident with the mimic in the late 15 th century DR, Gnomengarde was home to exactly twenty rock gnomes , all of whom had some training as wizards and were generally friendly to but wary of visitors. They were:</p>
<p>Following this incident with the mimic, at least two more gnomes had become part of Gnomengarde:</p>
