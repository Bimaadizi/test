<h2>History</h2>
<p>Varen had been the Riders' leader from around 1464 DR and was a powerful warrior.</p>
<p>Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches , the young idealist Selinus accused Varen of managing a ring of horse thieves that stole Riders' horses, despite Selinus having no clear proof. This caused a schism among the Riders, but the accusation was true.</p>
