<p>Thaunder Galowglaive was an elderly dwarven cook that worked in the cookhouse of the Whistling Wizard inn located in Voonlar . He was one of the very few non-humans that resided in Voonlar circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thaunder was an atypical dwarf that kept himself clean-shaven, which did nothing to enhance his attractiveness. On the job, the cookhouse was hot and steamy from the boiling pots, fire pits, and ovens, and he wore minimal clothing for comfort.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He and his coworkers constantly groused and snapped at each other, but Thaunder was a dwarf of few words. They bickered amongst each other and berated the serving wenches constantly. Unfamiliar people entering the cookhouse risked their well-being and could expect to be welcomed with shouts, epithets, and thrown knives.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a competent cook, able to produce plain, wholesome farm cuisine without frills. He still retained most of his skill as a warrior but rarely needed to use it.</p>
