<p>Yulius was a domesticated displacer beast that remained in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The beast may have originally dwelt in Myth Drannor before its destruction as the companion of a resident, but one way or another (such as the rampant rifts through time in the temple) ultimately ended up in the ruins of the Throne of Thought in the 14 th century DR.</p>
