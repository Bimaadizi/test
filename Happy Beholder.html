<p>The Laughing Beholder , also known as the Happy Beholder , was a tavern on the Rock of Bral owned and managed by the famous beholder Large Luigi in the mid-to-late 14 th DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern stood in the Low City part of Bral , near the Docks. It lay in the heart of a wedge-shaped block of buildings neighboring Shou-town , defined by Dock Street, Dragon Street, and Eel Street. It stood behind the Griffon Company headquarters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a small yet flourishing establishment. Luigi kept a green parrot in the bar to bring good cheer to patrons.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Thanks to Large Luigi's great magical powers, namely charm person , charm monster , and sleep , trouble in the Laughing Beholder was stopped almost as soon as it started. In any case, thugs and thieves rarely started something here.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Thanks to the beholder's many eyes, Large Luigi hardly ever missed an order. He used his telekinesis eye ray to mix his drinks and to deliver them through the air direct to a patron.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Large Luigi bought the bar some time after he arrived on the Rock of Bral, having hitched a ride on a human tradesman from H'Catha after he achieved enlightenment and had to flee his fellow beholders.</p>
<p>The giff Commodore Krux of the Second Wind met a group of adventurers in the Happy Beholder to recruit them to fight against the astral elves of the Xaryxian Empire.</p>
