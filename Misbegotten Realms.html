<p>The Misbegotten Realms were a place somewhere.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was the site of the Verdant Desert, which was formerly known as the Verdant Forest before something Nimrod of Nump, the mage who made his lair there, did.</p>
<p>The realms had some unexplained, and possibly unwanted, connection to Earth , recording several strange and occasionally regrettable references to its popular culture of past decades.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>One of the realms was the Kingdom of Slumdudgeon. Within its borders stood the legendary House of Out, whatever that was.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The realms were home to such mages as Nimrod of Nump , inventor of spells and magical items and mishaps; Mooncalf the Monocular, who once cast Bigby's interposing eye without another eye handy; and of course the great sage Elkwhisker , who went to Earth and rambled on about all this.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>It was a silly place. [ speculation ]</p>
