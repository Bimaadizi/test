<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Guardian wandered Spiderhaunt. During the day, it only noticed travelers and walked away unless they recklessly harmed the forest. During the night, it lurked in the shadows and watched the fires of travelers' camps to be sure they were not using living wood. If the forest was harmed, the Guardian attacked after the fire went out.</p>
