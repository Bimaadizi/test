<p>Khaszlokhar was a great draegloth , a champion of Lolth that served her in the Demonweb Pits .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR , Khaszlokhar was assigned to guard the Abyss -ward side of the Rift Between Worlds and the orb of Lolth placed there. Seeking to prevent the destruction of Eberron and Toril , the sage Valana sent a team into the Demonweb to repair the hole in reality and sabotage Lolth's plans. They were able to use a sacrifice of life force to shrink the portal , though that meant that Khaszlokhar fell upon them while they were weakened. Despite the disadvantage, the fearsome draegloth was defeated, and the precious orb of Lolth stolen.</p>
