<p>Biaste Ganderlay was the mother-in-law of Lord Feringal Auck in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Biaste was a caring mother, but eventually became very ill with a condition known as the wilting . Such an affliction could only be cured by powerful clerics , and not by changes in mood. Her daughter, Meralda Ganderlay , used this as inspiration to marry the lord of Auckney, Feringal.</p>
<p>Around the time of her daughter's marriage in the late 1360s DR , the lord kindly hired clerics of Helm : High Watcher Kalorc Risten and his assistant, Watcher Beribold . Beribold was able to cure Biaste's difficult condition. Biaste was excited for the prospect of her daughter being the most beautiful wife in the village of Auckney , which eventually became a reality.</p>
