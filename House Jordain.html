<p>The word "jordain" originated from the Old Netherese language, the progenitor language to the Halruaan language . It meant "fool," however the meaning of the word was different in the days of the ancient empire. A fool was a counselor and entertainer of kings, an individual who advised their lord through witting satire of song and dance.</p>
