<p>Dust of tracelessness was an enchanted powder that covered up the tracks of its user and other nearby creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This power was typically found within finely sewn pouches , each containing around 13 to 24 pinches-worth of the substance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a pinch of this powder was into the air within an interior space, it caused a floor space of up to 1,000 square feet (93 square meters) to take on an appearance of decades of disuse, becoming dusty, dirty, laden in cobwebs. When used in an outdoor space, such as being sprinkled along a trail, a pinch of this powder would cause all evidence of the user and up to a dozen other human -sized individuals and horses to be
erased for as far back as a 1 mile (1,600 meters). Regardless of where it was used, this powder did not produce any dweomer .</p>
<p>Later iterations of this power in the late 14 th century DR were comparatively less potent, only affecting a chamber space of up to 100 square feet (9.3 square meters) and only removing outdoor trails as far back as 250 feet (76 meters) into the distance. However, these later iterations continued to leave no lingering aura after use.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creating some dust of tracelessness required use of the spell pass without trace .</p>
