<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aptem had tanned skin and short white hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Aptem was deployed to Eveningstar to aid the war effort there. One of his duties was interviewing the elven ex-slave Mirini Elemys , who had broken free on her own accord and reached Eveningstar. Aptem learned a great deal about the inner workings of the drow from her, especially that of House Avithoul , the premier slavers of Sschindylryn. Together, they created a plan to raid and sabotage Avithoul with a slave revolt, using Aptem's illusion magic to sneak Cormyrean agents in disguised as slaves.</p>
