<p>House Sahdein ( pronounced : /ˈ s ə ˈ d i n / Suh-DEEN was a noble family of the city of Procampur in the Vast . They were one of the younger noble families of the city, having originally emigrated from the far-off land of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sahdeins engaged in long-distance trade with a number of foreign lands, including their ancestral home of Zakhara.</p>
<p>In terms of faith, the Sahdeins revered the Cold Gods of the Elements , those who were known in Faerûn as the elemental lords . Their house's primary patron was Istishia , the goddess of elemental water . Over time, House Sahdein played an instrumental role in making worship of the elemental lords, primarily Istishia, acceptable in Procampur.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Sahdeins had neither any strong allies among the noble house of Procampur, nor any serious enemies. At the most they had a friendly rivalry with House Hannith , with the two houses always trying to outdo one another in being the most luxurious house in all of Procampur. They were relatively friendly with House Krimpach . And a disastrous failed effort of matchmaking with Seabury nearly led to war between the two houses.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>They had a house in the Nobles District of the city. Built with the funds of the house's founder, it was purposely designed with the intention of being the most ornate home in Procampur. Their manor had tan walls trimmed with gold and slender cylindrical towers, making it stand out against the more traditional architectural stylings of its neighbors. The inner courtyard had a garden with palm trees and other forms of plant life typical of oases.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This noble house's history in Procampur began roughly in the 1100s DR , when a Zakharan merchant vessel arrived at the city's docks. The eldest son of the vessel, Mustafa Sahdein , brought most of his family to settle in the city and over the next twenty years worked hard to build up both the respect and fortune necessary to be considered a Procampan noble.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, when Hamayarch Alamondh announced the dissolution of House Arawl , the Sahdeins were one of nine noble houses that offered to honor any unredeemed favors that the house had given out to adventurers .</p>
