<p>Shade was an half-elven rogue student of the Neverwinter Academy in Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shade was a half-elven man with a dark skin tone, piercing eyes, and shortly-cropped dark brown hair. He wore black clothes, rather than leather armor typical for a man of his trade.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Shade attended the same school as the person who would become the Hero of Neverwinter . He was a spy and assassin by trade and he felt the loneliness of such occupation. Shade may have had shown affection to the Hero of Neverwinter and agreed to acompany them to the graduation ceremony.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Wailing Death stricken the city of Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Shade resided and trained in the Neverwinter Academy, honing his roguish skills. Shade habitually spied on the Hero of Neverwinter, and, when they were ready to graduate, he was planning on changing the target of his voyeurism. Lady Hero Aribeth de Tylmarande was a candidate as Shade believed that she knew more about the Wailing Death than she made public, and the half-elf hoped to discover the naughty side of the famous paladin . However, that was not to be. His life was cut short in the attack on the Academy, that left most of its staff and students dead, and the school itself put to the torch.</p>
