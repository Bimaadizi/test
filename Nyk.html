<p>Nyk was a goblin who lived in the Lower Heart ward of Skullport in Undermountain around 1370 DR , and twin to Nok .</p>
<p>Nyk and Nok were a pair of enterprising goblins who swept up the dung left by the Raging Bull , a long-imprisoned minotaur suspended from the ceiling by The Deepfires inn. They used the dung as manure to grow mushrooms. They would tell stories about failed rescue attempts for a copper piece .</p>
