<p>The Council of Teziir was the leading body of government for the city of Teziir .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Council founded Teziir during the mid—14 th century DR with the hopes of attracting caravans with cargo bound for the Sea of Fallen Stars . The proximity to their arch-rival Westgate made this task difficult, though they did enjoy a degree of success. In 1359 DR the Council struck a deal with the Cormyrean Freesails where the Freesails would service Teziir's port once per week with a large cog for transport of caravan cargo. Caravans travelling to Teziir often were able to unload their goods onto a ship much faster than if they travelled to Westgate.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Harvas Peltsen was one of the original founders of Teziir and member of the Council in 1359 DR.</p>
