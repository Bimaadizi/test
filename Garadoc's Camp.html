<p>Garadoc's Camp was a small settlement of the barbarians of the Black Raven Tribe in the Frost Hills .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A band of Black Raven Uthgardt had established a camp on the top of Dhaemang's head , the most southern peak of the Frost Hills . From this breathtaking view, the Black Ravens spied on surrounding movements and they were able to make sudden attacks against the people of the south. The Black Ravens hunted in the woods and meadows of the Frost Hills.</p>
<p>The camp was the base of operations of a band of raiders. They were mostly warriors with no children; indeed, the barbarians' families were hidden in nearby safer villages.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>This camp was ruled by Garamel Talonhand , a female veteran explorer and a bandit who criticized outsiders as weak and decadent.</p>
