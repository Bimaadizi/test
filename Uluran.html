<p>Uluran was a mountainous county in Kamlann in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uluran also went by the names Shepherd's County , since most of its inhabitants were shepherds, and the Tomb Hills , since most of the royalty of Tethyr were buried somewhere underneath its mountains. The latter tradition came about to prevent the looting of the graves of the royal families.</p>
<p>In addition to shepherds, many among the population of Uluran were hunters and trappers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This long and narrow county of Kamlann was occupied primarily by the Starspire Mountains . To its west, on the Starspire Peninsula was its sister county of Starspur . To its north was the great forest of Wealdath , while across the Sulduskoon River to the south were the Purple Marches and the Crown Lands .</p>
<p>Hawkwing's Brook , a tributary of the Sulduskoon, divided the county—and the Starspire Mountains—in two.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>By 1370 DR , former member of Company of Eight , Silvanus Moondrop , ruled Uluran from his county seat at Uluran Keep .</p>
