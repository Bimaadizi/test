<p>The Cult of the Absolute was an organization that followed The Absolute .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cultists of the Absolute took many forms, from mangy goblinoids and ex- Lolthite drow , to cloaked humanoids .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The cult had several followers: those in high positions were known as True Souls , though Disciples were above them in the hierarchy. Many of the followers of the Absolute appeared to be stationed in Moonrise Towers . Those of the cult appeared to have been branded.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1492 DR , many important residents of Baldur's Gate appeared to act strangely. This included the high priest of Kelemvor , Father Alby , as well as the Head Librarian of Knowledge-Hold , Hayley Kroe . The former believed he had found insights into existence, whilst the latter was hoarding magic materials. It turned out both had joined the Cult of the Absolute, and at least Alby had become a True Soul . After a ritual, Father Alby slew Hayley Kroe with a dagger resembling a mind flayer . The Heroes of Baldur's Gate had been spying on the cultists, and were soon revealed. They were told that they would have to join the cult or be destroyed.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Absolute appeared to accrue followers in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 th century DR . Several groups of goblinoids pledged allegiance to the Absolute, to the point where they even abandoned worship of the chief of their godly pantheon, Maglubiyet . Drow, gnolls , and other beings also joined the cult. Some time later, it was claimed that the cult had taken Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard to Moonrise Towers.</p>
