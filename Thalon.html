<p>Thalon was an ancient lich.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thalon's appearance varied by the body he inhabited, but he generally had white fire behind the eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Thalon appeared to be familiar with music, and to be keen on being remembered, as well as somewhat sadistic and theatrical.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>During his duel with Laeral Rythkyn , Thalon employed a number of spells akin to sleep , charm person , lightning bolt , telekinesis , fireball , magic missile , and an unidentified spell that made eyes blur and water.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he later claimed to have the ability to subsume a target's knowledge not just by making them sit on his throne, but also by cooking and eating them, as well as the ability to breathe dragonfire.</p>
<p>He also displayed some posthumous ability to alter the writing in Laeral Rythkyn's library, rewriting her entire list of apprentices to contain his own alone.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Of note, Thalon was the beneficiary of the effects of Thalon's Throne , through which he could acquire fresh bodies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He generally waited at his tower, where he attacked mages who came in and collected their skulls. However, he had plans of going out for a bite someday, and eating all of the greatest mages of Faerun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thalon remained at his tower for an unknown length of time, fighting all people who came attracted by the legend of his throne until Laeral Rythkyn entered his tower in mid- Kythorn of 1357Â DR . The lich challenged her, but was destroyed. After her apprentice Blaskyn betrayed her, incapacitated her and sat on the throne instead, Thalon was reformed in Blaskyn's body. Laeral managed to narrowly slay him before he cooked and ate her.</p>
<p>Posthumously, Thalon somehow made his name the only one in Laeral's list of prospective apprentices; Laeral resolved to annihilate his throne as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Thalon's Throne , presumably created by him, was the subject of a popular rhyme.</p>
