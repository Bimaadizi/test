<p>Zeltaebar Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Vaelan . He became embroiled in Pandorym's re-sealing while he aided his nephew Warian Datharathi during his return to Vaelan in Tarsakh of 1374Â DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Zeltaebar Datharathi was tall and wiry, with thinning dark hair. He wore a black and gray tailored robe, as usual for businessmen.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>According to most of his family, Zel never told the whole truth. He was a master of disguise who had passed up on becoming a plangent, despite his family's insistence. He suffered, or rather the people around him suffered, from heroic snoring.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zeltaebar came across his nephew Warian while the latter was trying to visit his sister Eined Datharathi , who was missing, and in the process came to fight several of his uncle's men. He brought his nephew with him to the family meeting, in which his siblings insisted Warian go see his grandfather later that evening, though they were being puppeteered by Shaddon Datharathi . He stowed away in the ship where Sevaera Datharathi accompanied Warian, disguising himself, and there he shared with his nephew the observations he had made as to the family's behaviour after taking the plangent.</p>
<p>When Warian met Shaddon and refused to have his prototype removed, Zeltaebar, still in disguise, attempted to brain the patriarch with a crowbar. They barely escaped, pursued by Sevaera, herself possessed by Shaddon and then by Pandorym . He and his nephew had no choice but to flee into the Celestial Nadir , where they were saved from a possessed Sevaera by Ususi Manaallin and Iahn Qoyllor . From them, the two Datharathi would learn of Pandorym, and of Eined's death.</p>
<p>Zeltaebar chose not to join the fighting against Pandorym in the Imperial Weapons Cache of the Palace of the Purple Emperor in Tarsakh 19 , judging his strengths lay elsewhere.</p>
