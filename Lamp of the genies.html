<p>A lamp of the genies was perhaps the most common form of genie prison .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>As with all genie prisons , the lamp of the genies was used to snare a genie and force it into servitude. The maker of the lamp dictated the exact conditions that needed to be met for a genie to be freed once captured. These lamps could be used to trap dao , efreet , marids , and djinn .</p>
<p>Though used more often by humans and humanoids , these items were sometimes used by genies to punish their kin.</p>
