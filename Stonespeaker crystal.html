<p>They emanated strong auras of conjuration and divination magic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While in someone's possession, a stonespeaker crystal granted them increased insight when investigating any subject matter. Each crystal possessed ten charges with which to create certain magical effects, a number of which were replenished each day.</p>
<p>It could be used to cast spells that allowed the wielder to speak with different living (or once-living) beings, including animals , plants , and the dead .</p>
<p>Anyone that attuned to one of these crystals would be receptive to visions of events that played out in the past, were currently ongoing, or could happen in the future.
