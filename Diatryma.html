<p>The diatryma ( pronounced : / d i ɑː ˈ t r aɪ m ɑː / dee-ah-TRY-mah ) was an ancient large, flightless bird native to the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gigantic bird was about 8​ to ​12 feet (2.4​ to ​3.7 meters) tall. Its short wings rendered it flightless. It had a thick neck and a deadly powerful hooked beak.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The drow used their hugely plumed feathers for decoration. The mercenary Jarlaxle sported one of these on his wide brimmed hat, as both an ornamental and a functional magical item known as a feather of diatryma summoning . By blowing into the feather, Jarlaxle was able to summon a diatryma bird.</p>
