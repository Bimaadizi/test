<p>Watchway Tower was one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeep 's Trollwall , located in the city's graveyard district, the City of the Dead .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tower was located at the northeastern corner of the City of the Dead. Outside of the City of the Dead, in the North Ward of Waterdeep , its exterior stood at the southern end of the walkway known as the Cliffwatch .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Watchway Tower stood four stories tall. It was directly connected to the eastern Trollwall and was situated at its northeast corner, right where it ended before the Cliffwatch as a gap, a sheer 100 feet (30 meters) drop that presented a grand view of the countryside east and south of the city.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>Being a torchtower, Watchway Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Watchway Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch, who carefully watched over the edge of the Cliffwatch for any sign of invasion. Four members of the Watch were always stationed inside of the tower, while one was posted outside to watch for any trouble in the nearby alleyways abutting the City of the Dead.</p>
