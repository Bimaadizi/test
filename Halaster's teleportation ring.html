<p>Halaster's teleportation rings were magic items that allowed the wearer to teleport without error .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once relatively common, these rare rings could teleport the wearer from their current location to a predetermined location on the same plane upon speaking a command word or through sheer force of will. However, Halaster cursed these rings to transport the wearer to a location of his choosing. To make matters worse, all of the equipment carried by the wearer, including the teleportation ring , would be stripped from them during the teleportation and scattered throughout Undermountain .</p>
<p>The command word for these rings was "Athlas", which meant "lost" in an ancient northern dialect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These rings were placed throughout the ruins of Undermountain.</p>
