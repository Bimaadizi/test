<p>Firestars , also known as moondancers , were a species of small, aloof glowing nocturnal beings.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When active, a firestar was a fist-sized mote of light, ranging from as bright as a torch, all the way to total darkness if they so desired; they were often mistaken for will-o'-wisps . The body of a firestar was a 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) ovoid object, covered in a spiderlike web of glowing nerves; when they retracted their nerves to rest during the day, this object was sometimes mistaken for an ornamented egg of sorts.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A nocturnal creature, firestars would dance intricate patterns while exploring the landscape and ignoring nearby creatures or people. During the day, they would rest in elevated, unreachable areas and absorb sunlight and heat. They never initiated combat. Firestars were secretive about their own reproduction, and only conversed with creatures that employed telepathy or speak with monsters . Drawn to light, firestars often investigated campfires during the night, and they sometimes sought these out to heal themselves. They traveled up to 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) to investigate fire, and up to 200 yards (180 meters) to investigate magic. Firestars could understand some words of Common and sometimes other local languages.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These illuminated beings could willfully control how much light emanated from their bodies, from pitch black to as bright as a lit torch . They would use their radiance to communicate, changing both their patterns and intensity of flashing.</p>
<p>They were immune to most magic, excluding magical detection, cold-based spells , and magic missile . They could also absorb energy from natural or magical flames, and used this energy to heal themselves. If exposed to enough thermal energy the excess would bolster them instead; a firestar that absorbed enough heat could endure combat for about four times as long.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Firestars fought by unleashing a jolt of electricity, resembling a small lightning bolt . This jolt could be shot up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) away and was conducted by metal.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They generally ignored travelers. Moondancers had an intrincate language of their own, using a pattern of flashing lights accompanied by fluctuating luminosity and movements; they spent the evenings dancing with their peers.</p>
<p>Firestars sometimes served the will of Brandobaris , Corellon Larethian , , Chauntea , Hanali Celanil , Lurue , Marthammor Duin , and Finder Wyvernspur , as well as Selûne in her aspect of Bright Nydra .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Firestars were known to live in the Shalhoond forest on the southern Endless Wastes , and along the Tethyamar Trail road in Daggerdale .</p>
<p>Firestars possessed organs that were valued in several aspects of arcane spellcasting, worth between one to five gold pieces . One organ was used as a material component in the spell dancing lights . Other organs could be harvested for the production of magical inks used in scrolls of control flames , dancing lights , and detect magic .</p>
<p>Firestars could be trapped as part of the creation of spell mirrors .</p>
