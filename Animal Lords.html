<p>The Animal Lords were near- godlike spirits inhabiting the Beastlands that had dominion over all animals of their type across the Prime Material and Upper Planes .</p>
<p>The Animal Lords were anthropomorphic representations of their animal kinds, as animals in humanoid shape. There was a lord for every kind of natural animal. Thus, in the Beastlands lived countless animal lords. Each Animal lord had two possible shapes: that of an animal and that of a beautiful humanoid with subtle characteristics of the lord's animal.</p>
<p>Animal lords were immune to charm effects and they had innate telepathy and the ability to foresee perils to a certain degree.</p>
