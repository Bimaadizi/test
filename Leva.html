<p>Leva was one of the engineers that worked at the logging camp by the Lantan-Samarach portal in the jungles of Samarlogh in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leva had a youthful face and hay-colored hair. He wore his facial hair in a trimmed goatee.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Leva was among the gnomes who staffed the illegal logging operation in the Samarlogh. A fellow engineer Tamith Timekeep created an improved logging machine design that sparked Leva's greed. He wanted the blueprints for himself to gain acclaim and a hefty bonus pay. Leva convinced lonely Tamith he sought her affection and lured her into the jungle to be murdered. Leva lied to Dall Nickleplate , the camp's overseer, blaming Tamith's death on a dinosaur attack. He burned and buried her body in secrecy outside the logging camp. However, the violent death created a vengeful ghost who sought justice appearing outside the camp every night</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers hired by merchant Sa'Sani of Samargol arrived at the Lantan-Samarach portal , they helped the gnomes in dealing with several incidents, including the poisoning of the camp's main engineer. They came across Tam's disoriented ghost and followed the undead's directions to her charred body with a distinct melted necklace. When Tamith Timekeep's body was presented to Dall Nickleplate, he immediately recognized the jewelry and realized Leva's guilt. As Leva was being interrogated, Tamith's angry spirit attacked and killed the murderer. Her spirit found peace, as Dall sent both bodies back to Lantan for burial.</p>
