<p>Hide n' Hair was a tannery in the Upper Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Hide n' Hair was a one-story building in fair condition.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the shop consisted of crude wooden shelves stacked floor to ceiling with skeletal remains of varying sizes, ages, and species.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Hide n' Hair processed and worked hides of all species, with no apparent restriction based on race or origin. The walls were adorned with a diverse and sometimes disturbing array of finished pelts, contributing to the establishment's eerie ambiance. Pricing was determined by size, quality, and the time required for preparation, with medium-sized animal pelts starting at 1 gp .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Hide n' Hair's shopkeeper seemed to change with each visit. In 1370 DR , the shop was owned by Norm Flendur . He ran the business as though nothing was unusual. When questioned about his predecessors, he offered only vague recollections, as did all who had managed the shop before him.</p>
