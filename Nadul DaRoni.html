<p>Nadul Da Roni was a gnomish artist and inventor who lived as a hermit near High Horn . He was undoubtedly a genius, but also quite possibly a madman (which may be one of the factors involved in his natural ingenuity).</p>
<h2>Activites</h2>
<p>Some of his inventions were not always foolproof and some were quite risky to use. His furnace wagon , for instance, had a one-in-ten chance of spontaneously combusting per hour of constant use.</p>
<p>He sketched portraits on commission and had drawn Elminster , Azoun IV , and Aurora (a copy of whose portrait appeared on the cover of her catalogue ). If someone sent him their name and location, he would eventually come and find them.</p>
<h2>Inventions</h2>
<p>Some of Nadul's novel creations included:</p>
