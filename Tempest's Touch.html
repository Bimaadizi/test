<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before the late 14 th century DR , a tribe of reclusive wood elves inhabited a small unnamed island on the Sea of Fallen Stars . They were responsible for creating numerous Tempest's Touch bows. Sages said the elves learned to harness the fiercest storms that passed the sea into these weapons through strange rituals. However, the wood elves were forced to abandon their island home after several years of abnormally calm weather. It was theorized that Thayan wizards were responsible for the weather manipulation, protecting the Red Wizards' merchant vessels.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one of the Tempest's Touch bows was sold by one of the exotic weapon dealers in Westgate 's Market Triangle .</p>
