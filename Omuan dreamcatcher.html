<p>Omuan dreamcatchers were wondrous items that trapped nightmares, found in the ruins of the Forbidden City of Omu .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Omuan dreamcatchers were enchanted woven trinkets of woven nets and feathers that were used by the ancient Omuans to trap the nightmares that plagued the city's children, granting them restful sleep. The nightmares and fears trapped within Omuan dreamcatchers were less of an esoteric nature and more of nightmarish beings that, when trapped together, mixed, blended, and empowered eachother and, when given opportunity, "went bump in the night."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime during several decades of imprisonment before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the cambion spawn of Mephistopheles â€“ Raphael, used an ancient Omuan dreamcatcher full of nightmares to torture Hope , in attempts to break her will and force her into servitude.</p>
