<p>Screeb was a drunkard and a ruffian who frequented the Black Eye tavern of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Screeb was a middle-aged man with fair skin and gray hair. His facial hair was trimmed into a thin pencil-like shape.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Screeb and two of his drunkard friends stumbled across Mantides , a disgraced paladin of Lathander who was drowning his sorrows in ale at Black Eye in Westgate's Harbor Loop . The drunkards accused Mantides of being a washed-out drunk, insinuated he lost his holy sword and that the church took Mantides's manhood when it stripped him of paladinhood. Despite harassment, Mantides did not stoop to violence. Screeb accused the ex-paladin of being a coward, and his group stumbled out of the tavern, leaving Mantides alone.</p>
