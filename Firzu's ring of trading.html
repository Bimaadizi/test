<p>Firzu's ring of trading was a unique enchanted ring that once belonged to the lady merchant named Firzu , who did business in the Chionthar Valley in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Firzu's ring possessed a simple enchantment that improved the wearer ability to lie, bluff, and mislead – invaluable for merchants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Firzu was a notorious merchant who regularly tried to sail past Reithwin's toll house without paying the toll for the trade goods he transported. Firzu's life ended sometime before the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , when the town was plunged into the darkness and turned into the shadow-cursed lands . His charred body, still wearing his enchanted ring, was stored in the House of Healing 's morgue – likely murdered by the wicked Sharran Thorm family for avoiding the tolls.</p>
