<p>Eldelorr was a sparsely-populated and almost ruined fishing hamlet on Cape Raeth to the southwest of the Cloakwood .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eldelorr stood on Cloak Bay 's north-westernmost top where the Cloakwood reached the waters of the bay. By the 14 th century DR, Eldelorr was a collection of single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Eldelorr.</p>
<p>Inhabitants of Eldelorr survived through salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs , silverfins , and laethe , a species of eel -like creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Eldelorr, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 th century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks.</p>
