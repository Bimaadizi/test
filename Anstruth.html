<p>The College of Anstruth ( pronounced : /ˈ æ n s t r ʌ θ / ÆN-struth listen ) was a traditional bardic college in Sundabar .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Even centuries after Anstruth's closure, the city of Sundabar remained famous for the quality of its musical instruments.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Anstruth harp , one of the Instruments of the Bards , was named after this college. It had been created by the legendary bard Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the Anstruth level of skill.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The College of Anstruth was one of the seven elder bardic colleges, dating back to Falataer, who had established it as the penultimate level of his bardic college. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, with Anstruth being the sixth, after Cli and before Ollamh . However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined. The College of Anstruth ceased its operations sometime after 1067 DR .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , the only remaining structure from the original college was a concert hall that had been converted into a warehouse.</p>
