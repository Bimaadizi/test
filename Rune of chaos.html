<p>A rune of chaos was a magical symbol representing chaos . There were at least nine runes of chaos.</p>
<p>The runes of chaos were a key part of the operation of the dread artifact Thakorsil's Seat . The horrid ritual of twin burnings —which involved the sacrifice, body and soul, of a good mage —created a crystal pane bearing one of the runes of chaos around the Seat . With all nine runes of chaos in place, a victim trapped in the chair was eternally bound to it and enslaved to the will of its owner.</p>
