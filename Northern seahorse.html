<p>Northern seahorse was a sub-species of seahorse or tropical pipe fish that dwelled in the Sea of Moving Ice in Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike their tropical cousins that were never found further north than the Shining Sea , northern seahorses inhabited the warm waters in the vicinity of underwater thermal vents in the Sea of Moving Ice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A small population of the northern seahorse was discovered in the late 15 th century DR by the northern ichthyologists. This species perplexed the sages, who never expected to see the species that preferred warm waters in the frigid ice-covered seas. One theory suggested that in the ancient past, Toril 's oceans were much warmer, allowing a population of tropical pipefish to migrate north.</p>
