<p>The Hallow-Halls , or The Small-Temples , was a scenic city block in the Altarside neighborhood of Ravens Bluff 's Temple District , home to numerous small temples or shrines dedicated to deities of the elven , dwarven , halfling , and gnomish pantheons . Both of the names the block was known by were unofficial, though widely used.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The block was encircled by Manycoins Way to the north, Raven Way to the east, Crothmar's Lane to the west, and De Villars Ride to the south.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The small temples that filled the Hallow-Halls were of beautiful make, with smooth curving walls of stone. They had magical protections cast upon them. And at the heart of the block stood a splendidly well-kept grove of trees with a spring-fed pool in its center.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Hallow-Halls complex was a popular public space among elves , often quietly crowding it, taking in the atmosphere of the forest groves before moving on with their day.</p>
<p>Each of the temples were tended to by priests , such as Alysia Rosebud who oversaw the shrine of Hanali Celanil , Fiona Starlight a priestess of Sehanine Moonbow , and Jackie Fancytoes who oversaw the shrine of Sheela Peryroyl .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR , in the month of Uktar or " The Rotting ", a cult dedicated to the dead power Moander and backed by the deity Ghaunadaur chose The Small-Temples to be the second site in their series of attacks with an experimental gas weapon that had been made near Dark Hollow . They narrowed it down to the shrine of the Seldarine, as they were rivals of Ghaunadaur. A Moanderite in green robes tried to enter the shrine, but was stopped at the door by temple guards. He chose to drop the vial there, unleashing the gas weapon and killing dozens of innocent Ravenians, as well as a nearby unit of City Watchmen that had rushed over to aid the temple guards. All exposed to the green gas were disintegrated, leaving behind no bodies.</p>
<p>A group of adventurers working for the Scout Rangers arrived shortly on the scene, alerted to the attack by the sounds of screaming and a panicking crowd. Most of the shrine's wooden entrance had been decimated, there were holes in the its ceiling, and one side of the complex had caved in due to disintegrated wooden pillars. The pillars displayed clean, smooth cuts from the gas. But overall, the shrine was still standing and not likely to collapse anytime soon, thanks to its stone make and magical wards. Alysia Rosebud stood transfixed at the sight of her Hanalian shrine, even as she stood the risk of being trampled by the throng of panicked people. The adventurers brought the priestess to her senses and consoled her, learning all that they could from her testimony.</p>
<p>Through further investigation of the scene the adventurers found the number of affects to imply over forty civilians people were disintegrated, the armor and weapons of six City Watchmen, two holy symbols of Corellon Larethian that had been dropped by the temple guards, and the holy symbols and personal affects of ten priests of various faiths. They also discovered, alongside the vial, a pin in the shape of the symbol of Moander, a right hand with an open fanged mouth in its palm.</p>
