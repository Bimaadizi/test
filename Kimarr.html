<p>Kimarr was an ambitious and power-hungry mage and traitor to the city of Phlan in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , mages Kimarr and Quil of Phlan were sent on an expedition to find the legendary Taydome's Keep , an ancient hold that guarded powerful magics . The keep was discovered in the Shaar just before the city of Phlan, and other settlements on the shores of the Moonsea were spirited away by the allied forces of the evil deity Bane . Council member Sasha and her bodyguards had left Phlan just before the city disappeared and were heading to Taydome's Keep after receiving a word from the two mages. The Council of Ten hoped to take the keep and use it as a stronghold.</p>
<p>The keep was found to have once been home to Lord Taydome , who weaved a magical contract with ogres and giants of antiquity into the castle's walls. Kimarr discovered a scroll penned by Taydome that allowed for the use of the contract and its magic for enslaving giants with whom the original agreement was struck. Seeing an opportunity, Kimarr recited spells several times daily, enslaving more giants with each casting. Under his control, the keep's giants captured Councilmember Sasha once she arrived to inspect the new holding.</p>
<p>Kimarr knew of Sasha's value and used her as a bargaining chip in dealing with Bane's forces. However, Quil, still loyal to the Council, stole the spell scroll from his old ally and hid away within the keep's hidden passages and tunnels. Subsequently, Sasha was freed by the heroes of Phlan, with Quil's aid, while Kimarr was presumed slain after he transformed himself into a fierce blue dragon .</p>
