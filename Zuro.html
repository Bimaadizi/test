<p>House Zuro was a mercenary company and noble family of one of the city-states in the Blade Kingdoms . The Zuros possessed a significant number of troops, granting the leader of the House the title of Blade Captain and the privilege to vote in a Blade Council.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the "white war" of the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , between city-states of Colletro and Sumbria , the Blade Captains of the Blade Kingdoms gathered in Sumbria or the annual Blade Council that involved all voting Princes and Blade Captains of the realm. During the council, Blade Captain Zuro passionately advocated for the use of smoke powder in military of the Kingdoms. This motion was brought times and times before, crating a point of contention between captains. Most notably, House Toporello 's Orlando Toporello , who considered "guns" to be childish and unreliable. Blade Captain Zuro's goal failed, even after sharing the young inventor Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomarta 's advanced concept.</p>
