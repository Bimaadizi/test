<p>The lake was connected to the Lake of Shadows by a river, which flowed in the direction of Lake Thoroot. The lakes were about a tenday apart.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lake Thoroot was a large and flat underground lake. It was surrounded by steep cliffs, a waterfall, and stalactites. An island in the lake housed the dwarven (formerly drow ) city of Zanhoriloch , and the lake boasted a colony of aboleths by the same name.</p>
<p>There were green-yellow-glowing jellyfish in the lake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 / 1373 DR , a drow expedition led by Quenthel Baenre camped on the shores of the lake near the waterfall while they sought for information about a downed ship of chaos . While scouting the lake, Valas Hune encountered a strange, mutated drow who urged him to flee. Valas was subsequently captured by an aboleth named Jooran , who used his slime to turn him into the same kind of mutated drow. Valas was able to escape back to his companions and Pharaun Mizzrym returned him to drow-form via a polymorph spell.</p>
