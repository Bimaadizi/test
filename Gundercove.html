<p>Gundercove was a ramshackle lodging for sailors, found in Tulmene on the Tethyr Peninsula in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was once a fish shed, evidenced by its persistent stench and the constant dampness of Tulmene's docks, built atop wharves with the waves crashing against the inn's dining room. The building's roof was a patchwork of rusting metal and white whale oil and seal hide sealants that kept the ceiling from leaking.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Gundercove was drowned in raucous of unruly sailors, bawling of seabirds, smashing and moving of barrels , and stacking of the docks. The sound became a thunderous cacophony every time it rained as the drops banged on the metal roof plates.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn offered simple lodgings to sailors. Its humble private rooms were furnished with straw and rope mattresses and hammocks, clothing pegs, a single chair, and a candle lamp . As for hygiene , each tiny room came with a nightbucket and a jug of water for washing up. In comparison to more cosmopolitan places, Gundercove was cheap; however, its prices were comparable to other sleeping arrangements found in Tulmene.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gundercove was mentioned in Volothamp Geddarm 's guide to the Lands of Intrigue , and the author warned any decent-looking female guest to expect to be mistaken for a companion by its sailors and asked for her price.</p>
