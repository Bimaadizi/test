<p>Jondar the Valiant was a paladin of Helm , who was active in Tethyr in the early 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jondar was a renowned hero of Ithmong , the town later known as Darromar. She famously defeated a medusa in the Starspire Mountains of Tethyr in the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , the deed for which the stonecutters' guild of Ithmong carved a life-size statue in Jondar's honor. Or so the story went. Her statue was placed on a large fountain at Ithmong's center, atop a cube pedestal carved with medusae heads. With generations passing, details of the statue's creation became obfuscated, and her deeds in dealing with medusae forgotten. The statue of Jondar the Valiant remained atop the fountain, growing moss and collecting pigeon dung . However, to everyone's shock, the mage named Mibbet the Meddler , in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , decided to cast the stone to flesh spell on the paladin's carving. His hunch turned out to be true as Jondar herself stepped down from the pedestal, thanked Mibbet, and walked into the sunset.</p>
<p>What was left of the statue became known as The Pedestal of Jondar the Valiant . It was removed from Ithmong, and, by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Jondar's pedestal was a part of the curio collection of Mintassan's Mysteries in Westgate .</p>
