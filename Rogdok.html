<p>While Rogdok's goblins considered him their king, he saw them in much less favorable terms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , a tribe of goblins came to worship a wild mage by the name of Adoy , who they believed was Bargrivyek the goblinoid deity of cooperation and territory. Curious as to why a large number of goblins appeared so suddenly, Rogdok went to investigate.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity, Rogdok imprisoned Adoy and used his control over the goblinoid "deity" to appoint himself as the king of the tribe.</p>
<p>At some point he and his hobgoblins killed a local ranger by the name of Rilsa .</p>
