<h2>History</h2>
<p>Due to her faith in a dragon god, Vishva had been casted out of her clan.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, Vishva became the leader of the Platinum Cadre after the death of the previous leader, the paladin Patrin. Although other dragonborn shunned them, Vishva led the remaining members of the Cadre who still wanted to serve her country.</p>
<p>She convinced Medrash to help the members of the Cadre by cleansing them of the power they had gained from Tiamat .</p>
<p>When Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about Tchazzar plan's to invade the dragonborn nation, Vanquisher Tarhun assigned to the Platinum Cadre the mission to destroy Gestaniius and liberate High Imaskar from her forces, so the Imaskari would lend their aid to the thymari . Vishva took part in this operation as one of the high-ranking officials of the Cadre.</p>
