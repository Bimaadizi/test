<p>The wizard Martek had foreseen the need for the gems in order to completely defeat Khalitharius, and thus hid them throughout the Raurin . The wizard had enchanted his own sanctum so that as soon as all the gems were brought there, he'd be brought back to life, to defeat the efreet.</p>
<p>The Star of Mo-Pelar, he gave to the pharaoh Amun-Re. The Star of Shah-Pelar, he gave to an unnamed pharaoh of the desert, before it was stolen by Badr Al-Mosak . The Star of Aga-Pelar, he used to personally bind Khalitharius , giving it then to the Lord of Pazar to keep the efreet prisoner. Martek hid the Star of Melos-Pelar in the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon, and the Star of Shah-Pelar in an abandoned temple beneath the Oasis of the White Palm .</p>
