<p>Arglath was a massive elder orb beholder from Ooltul , presumed to be alive in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arglath was a beholder of monstrous size from Ooltul, and one of the mightiest beholders to escape the city's destruction.</p>
<p>At one point, it tried to conquer the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in Shadowdale but was destroyed by Elminster Aumar . Afterward, from time to time, Elminster disguised himself as Arglath, aided by the fact that nobody else knew of the death of the elder orb. In that role, Elminster foiled Manshoon 's plot to take over Zhentil Keep and received in exchange a list of true names of powerful beings, including the phaerimm Triumvirate ruling Ooltul.</p>
