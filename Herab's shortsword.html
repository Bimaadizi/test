<h2>History</h2>
<p>Herab's shortsword was a typical weapon and an implement of torture used by many officers of the Zhentarim . These weapons had the ability to absorb spilled blood and transfer its healing power to the wielder. Many owners of such blades became addicted to the daily bloodletting of their prisoners and slaves. At some point before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Captain Herab pried the sword from the hands of a dead Zhent.</p>
<p>Captain Herab wielded the blade during her time working for the Black Network , transporting smuggled weapons and supplies of an orcish army that menaced the city of Daggerford . She used the shortsword when faced the Hero of Daggerford and his allies in the pirate hideout of the Crab's Claw Coast . With her life likely being forfeit, the fate of Herab's shortsword was unknown after that point.</p>
