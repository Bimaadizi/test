<p>Milo Dudley was the dwarven bartender of the Dragon's Jaws tavern and inn in Suzail .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Milo was a friend to everyone who came through the doors. He was very observant and quick to notice anyone in need, offering to help in anyway he could, often before a patron even had recognized the needâ€”whether it was simply a refill or something more serious like a need for a bodyguard.</p>
