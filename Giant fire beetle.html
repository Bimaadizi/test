<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Giant fire beetles were the smallest of all the giant beetles known to scholars. They grew to be about 2​ to ​2.5 feet (0.61​ to ​0.76 meters).</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>

<h2>History</h2>

That same year the Harper agent Ulvira Snowveins was running a pet store in Skullport that offered, among other creatures, giant fire beetles for sale.</p>
