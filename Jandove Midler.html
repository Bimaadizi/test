<p>Jandove Midler was a member of the extended Midler-Chandler family in the mid-1480s DR , who lived together in the Midler farmhouse near Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jandove was a middle-aged woman with a bob of brown hair, dressed in a long gray dress.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jandove was the child of Wilaver and Caryn Chandler , and sister of Graven . She was the spouse of Ricnan , and mother of their sons Normon and Thoben .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave . Unknown to the drow, the houseservant Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.</p>
<p>Jandove was kept contained by magical paralysis in the master bedroom with her brother Graven, under the watch of a few disgruntled drow. When saved, she showed the rescuers a passage into the attic space that would allow them to better sneak around the prowling priestess.</p>
