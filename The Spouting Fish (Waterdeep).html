<p>The Spouting Fish was a popular tavern in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located on the east side of the Way of the Dragon , at the corner where it turned north after branching west from the High Road at the Waymoot . Its popularity was largely due to its strategic location, which prompted many travelers entering the city from South Gate to stop there for a drink.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The tavern was characterized by a large water fountain shaped like an upright spouting fish. The large building had several floors built with a labyrinthine structure.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the Spouting Fish was brightly lit. All of the tavern's booths and benches, as well as the building's structural beams and posts were unpainted and, for that reason, very flammable. As a result of the fire hazard, two members of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors were hired to remain constantly on guard within the tavern.</p>
<p>The tavern's cellar contained an entrance to a surface shaft that led to a small junction in the Waterdhavian sewer system.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Spouting Fish was notoriously noisy and boisterous.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The tavern offered numerous drinks, including zzar , wines , and beers . The food, which included roast fowl, sausages, and bread , was heavily salted to induce patrons to consume more beverages.</p>
<p>Another reason for the tavern's popularity was intense advertising performed by street criers across the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the sewer intersection that connected to the Spouting Fish's cellar was an access point to one of the Xanathar Guild hideouts. It was guarded by a gazer .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the midâ€’14 th century DR , the Spouting Fish was owned by the fearless human Janess Imristar .</p>
