<p>The Raor Dynasty was the first of the four dynasties of the Third Age of Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Like the dynasties of the previous age, the Raors ruled as bakkal priests over Calimshan.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The seat of power of the Raor bakkals was located in the city of Calimport .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Raor Dynasty saw the empire of Calimshan expand to include Calimshan proper, Tethyr , Iltkazar , and Mir , stretching as far north as the Snowflake Mountains . The lands outside of Calimshan were collectively known as the Calishar Emirates .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little is remembered about the Raor Dynasty, beyond the fact that it ushered in Calimshan's Third Age and the greatest extent of its empire. The dynasty was founded in −1900 DR .</p>
<p>During the Raor dynasty, the Caltazar Hills became a place of constant conflict with the Alimir Hive of beholders , which would escalate for many centuries.</p>
<p>The dynasty's short time was brought to a swift end in −1838 DR by the red wyrm Ylveraasahlisar the Rose Dragon. Calishite adventurers had killed one of her offspring in a raid of her horde. In revenge, she attacked the city of Calimport, destroying nearly two-thirds of the city, including the Caleph's Court . The army was decimated before her wrath, and the bakkal was slain. Ylveraasahlisar took the throne of the empire for herself and reigned for over a century.</p>
