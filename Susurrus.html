<p>The Susurrus was a Lolth-touched fiendish wendigo monstrous hunting spider of enormous proportions that ravaged Shadowdale 's geographical backroads for millennia.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Its maddening whispers and diseased bite turned all fey who encountered it into cannibalistic wendigos.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Appearing as a gigantic arachnid covered in matted white fur and hateful glowing eyes, the Susurrus floated towards its prey with the charred bloody stumps of its legs outstretched. It bore the faint emblem of a spider on its brow.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Susurrus was unleashed upon the fey of Shadowdale in −2549 DR by the drow of Maerimydra when they turned the surrounding woodland into the Land Under Shadow . Eventually, the fey decided to make a pact in order to trap the horror and vowed never to use the region's crossroads and backroads while the Susurrus lived. This ensured the monster could never escape into the real world but also cut off many fey from Faerie , causing their numbers to dwindle over time.</p>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , guided and prepared by the goddess Mielikki , Azalar Falconhand lured the Susurrus back to the real world, where the monster was finally slain by him and a band of adventurers . With this act, the fey began to return in numbers to the land of Shadowdale.</p>
