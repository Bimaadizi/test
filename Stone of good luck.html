<p>A stone of good luck , or luckstone , was a small, magically imbued stone that granted its wearer good fortune.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stones of good luck were usually made from polished agate , frost agate , carnelian , or alexandrite , though other minerals could also be used. If viewed through a detect magic spell, a stone of good luck gave off a faint evocation aura.</p>
<p>A luckstone was originally said to appear exactly like a philosopher's stone or loadstone . In fact, discerning a philosopher's stone from a luckstone seemed to require some destructive testing: placing a suspect stone in molten lead would destroy a luckstone , but not a philosopher's stone .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>They were said to originate in the halfling country of Luiren , with the "luck of the hin" having rubbed off on the stones.</p>
<p>Gold dragons of adult age and older (meaning older than a century) could give any gem the properties of a luckstone for 19 hours to 39 hours depending on age. These temporary luckstones gave their benefits to every good creature within 60–120 ft. (18.3–36.6 m) depending on age, if owned by the dragon but only to the holder if given to another creature.</p>
<p>A crystal dragon who was very old or older could enchant one of its own scales as if it was a stone of good luck for 9 to 12 hours according to its age. They gifted these to especially friendly visitors.</p>
