<p>Gnasher was an enchanted club created by the druid only known as Makal of the Pine some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Gnasher possessed a +2 enchantment that increased the weapon's damage and improved the wielder's aim. Additionally, its sharp splinters caused the target to bleed after each successful bash embedded them into the target's flesh.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the weapon was carved by Makal of the Pine, and enchanted via boding the spirit of Makal's fierce wolverine animal companion to the Gnasher . This dangerous weapon remained in Makal's hands and served him on several occasions against orc loggers who threatened the druid's forest. Makal of the Pine was presumed dead by 1369 DR, when Gnasher was wielded by the Shadow Druid named Dalok who plagued the town of Trademeet .</p>
