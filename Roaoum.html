<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Roaoum held the Locathah Seat on the Nantarn Council by 1370 DR . However, out of all the councilors, he spoke the least and gave his thoughts only if requested. In fact, he considered most of the political discussions to be pointless and irritating and he cared only for the kelp harvest, fish hunting, winter food storage like all his fellow locathah. He was actually useful in advancing kelp production and food storage after the Twelfth Serôs War . In truth, Chief Cuvis waited to gain better weapons in trade for his tribe's woven nets and fish stores before he would help the alliance more.</p>
