<p>Elturian Grey was a strong-tasting and smelling sheep -milk cheese crafted in Elturel in the Western Heartlands , also known as stonework or dwarfcheese . It was also sold through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This heavy whitish cheese was streaked with black or blue veins, giving it the appearance of stone, hence its other names. Despite its appearance and unappetizing nicknames, this pungent cheese was a tasty treat. Elturian Grey was fermented using a certain species of mold that grew on grass and clover . The fermentation process took months but it left the cheese stable and able to be kept in open air without spoilage for almost a year. Matured cheese had a pungent aroma reminiscent of vinegar and taste of hot-sauce-fried ham and pineapple .</p>
<p>The name dwarfcheese was given to it due to almost all dwarves 's love for Elturian Grey. Many stout folk hoarded this cheese and endlessly praise it taste on words and writing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The premier cheese of Elturel in the midâ€“14 th century DR , Aurora not only solid it via Aurora's Emporium but kept some in her own larder. She enjoyed surprising it on guests who complained about Elturel and other trade cities, and its reputation spread.</p>
<p>By the early 1360s DR, these other trade cities were producing imitations, often made from cow's milk and with close names like "Elturel Grey" or "Elturel Gray". In 1365 DR , Sir Rivaldo kept an assortment of fine cheeses, including Elturian gray, when he traveled in a coach along the Trade Way from the Way Inn to Waterdeep . Circa 1366 DR , "Elturian gray" was being sold in neighboring Scornubel , where it was quite popular among the cheese selection at the Far Anchor inn, but Volothamp Geddarm remarked he didn't see much of it when in Elturel. By 1370 DR , "Elturian Gray" was available at The Rising Moon inn in Highmoon , Deepingdale , among its wide selection of strong cheeses.</p>
