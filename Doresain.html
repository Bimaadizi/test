<p>Doresain was an exarch of Orcus and the ruler of ghouls .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Doresain took the appearance of a ghoul whose eyes glowed with vile green energy. He had hoof-like feet and wore an elegant coat over leather armor , which was adorned with skulls.</p>
<p>He was known for creating hordes of ghouls, as well as maurezhi , which he made to lead legions of ghouls and ghasts to the Prime Material Plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early history</h3>
<p>Doresain was once a mortal elf and a worshiper of Orcus. In order to honor his deity, he feasted on the flesh of his fellow elves. Impressed by the raw and savage act, Orcus turned Doresain into the very first ghoul. Some sages noted that Doresain, in some form, founded a kingdom and became the great ruler over the ghouls in the Underdark of Oerth .</p>
<h3>Rise to Divinity</h3>
<p>Doresain became a servitor to Orcus in the Abyss . There he was imbued with a shard of Orcus' divinity and became known as the Ghoul King. Here, he would create ghouls from the servants of Orcus. The King of Ghouls took command of the a layer of the Abyss, the White Kingdom .</p>
<h3>Conquered</h3>
<p>Despite his devotion, Doresain would not stay subservient to Orcus, though not by choice. Yeenoghu staged an invasion of Doresain's layer (421st layer of the Abyss), which was right next to the Gnoll Lord's own layer (422nd layer of the Abyss). Orcus did not intervene, leaving Doresain to became a vassal of Yeenoghu. Instead of serving Yeenoghu, Doresain instead turned to the Seldarine . They took pity on the demigod, who was then able to escape the Gnoll Lord's tyranny in return for granting elves immunity to the paralytic touch of his minions. Yeenoghu later lost the ability to fully control Doresain.</p>
<h3>Return to Orcus</h3>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR , Doresain retained the shard of divinity originally given to him by Orcus. He returned to Orcus' side, this time as his exarch , as well as his servitor. No longer holding his original layer, the White Kingdom, Doresain settled into the layer owned by Orcus, Thanatos , the 113 th layer of the Abyss. Here, Doresain began to rule over part of Thanatos known as White Kingdom , which had the same name as his former home.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Doresain had several followers, particularly undead and especially ghouls. He was known to venture to the Negative Energy plane and seek out necromancers that were meddling there with the goal of turning them into ghouls. Doresain's holy symbol was the skull of a single ghoul, and though many ghouls did not know of or worship deities, those that did were known to pay homage to Doresain.</p>
<p>The Temple of Filth , in the Shadowfell 's version of Neverwinter , was once a shrine to Bhaal and Myrkul . It later became dedicated to Orcus and Doresain.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The undead of Evernight believed that the Demon Pit led to the White Kingdom in Thanatos.</p>
