<p>Spell storing weapons stored spells and could deliver them upon striking their target.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As the name suggested, a spell storing weapon stored spells for later use. To store a spell, the spellcaster simply cast the spell as normal, but targeted to the weapon, and the spell remained intact within it. The wielder of the sword magically knew the name of any stored spell, and could release it upon successfully striking their target. Eligible spells were subject to some limitations, such as being able to target a single creature only.</p>
