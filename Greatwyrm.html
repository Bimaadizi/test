<p>Greatwyrms were dragons that had achieved godlike abilities, approaching the powers of the aspects of Tiamat and Bahamut .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Greatwyrms were massive, exceeding the size of any other kind of dragon and rivalling the largest creatures in existence. Although their exact powers varied with each type of greatwyrm, in general all greatwyrms had abilities that allowed them to return to near-full strength just before death. They also all possessed extraordinarily heightened dragonsight , which allowed them to be aware of events and activities across many worlds of the Material Plane . Many of their other abilities were more powerful versions of those of the normal chromatic , metallic , or gem dragon from which the greatwyrm had ascended:</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>According to Fizban the Fabulous (one of Bahamut's aspects), greatwyrms were normally created when ancient dragons, usually at least twelve centuries old, ate or ritually merged with their "echoes" from other worlds, or consumed their energies in other ways. A powerful dragon could be helped along this path by one of the dragon gods.</p>
<p>Becoming a greatwyrm was akin to achieving apotheosis, and thus many greatwyrms were considered deities and worshiped by humanoids and other mortal races. While other dragons respected the power of the greatwyrms, they did not worship them nor regard them as gods.</p>
