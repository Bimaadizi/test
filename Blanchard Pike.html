<p>Blanchard Pike was one of the outlaw mercenary band from Cormyr called the Iron Collar Band , active in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blanchard Pike was a human male who wore studded leather armor and a horned helmet . He was, appropriately so, armed with a pike .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Blanchard, just like his rowdy teammates, was a boisterous braggart who attempted to intimidate others with the Iron Collar Band's so-called "famous" status.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Blanchard Pike and his two heavily drinking comrades found themselves in the town of Targos as the city was being besieged by a goblin army that served the Legion of the Chimera . Originally, the trio came from the southern nation of Cormyr where they did mercenary work far from Icewind Dale . They fled the Forest Kingdom due to some unrevealed event involving plundering tombs and being shackled by Cormyr's Purple Dragons . The group did not regret the flight. Pike and his mates were not willing to comply with Cormyr's many laws and fees that ruled over adventurers there.</p>
<p>Black Geoffrey, Blanchard Pike, Kickshaw, and a priest named Koluhm Bonecutter , all traveled as an "adventuring band" named the Iron Collar Band and eventually reached the unruly city of Luskan . There, they met a raggedy wizard , secretly an agent of the Arcane Brotherhood , Phaen of the Rags , who joined the group and told them of "easy gold" to be made in Targos as the town put out a call for adventurers at the time.</p>
<p>The Iron Collar Band accepted the contract with Targos, the worst possible employment, as far as Blanchard Pike was concerned. On the day when a band of mercenaries, who would soon become heroes of Targos, arrived at Ten Towns, the settlement became attacked as goblins somehow found a way past palisades and fortifications pouring into the docks and warehouses. Geoffrey, Pike, and Kickshaw didn't care for the attack and spent their day drinking and boasting at The Salty Dog Tavern .</p>
