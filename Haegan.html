<h2>History</h2>
<p>Captain Haegan operated out of Athkatla circa the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR and slavers under his command were red- robed wizard , priests of Cyric , and yuan-ti . His stock was auctioned off in the black market backrooms of the Copper Coronet. Haegan slaves were captured as far as the town of Scornubel , and a group was captured from there in 1369 DR for a buyer from Calimport . A young girl was among the captured humans. The entire group was bound to be executed after the buyer decided to abandon the order, and the slaves were deemed worthless. Abdel Adrian and his companions may have ruined the illegal slaving operations, freeing the young girl and other captives, slaying Haegan in the process.</p>
