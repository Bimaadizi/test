<p>Malika Tahoun was an oinoloth who was sent to destroy Cube 1717 . There, it became a captive of the skull lord Vargo and planned to escape.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Malika's body was covered in plagues and diseases . While on Cube 1717, Malika's body was entirely covered by a magical leather outfit that included an apron , gloves , and a mask in the shape of a bird 's beak with goggles made from smoked-glass . This outfit protected it from the pixelating curse and others from its inherent diseases. While it wore this outfit, it was difficult to identify Malika as a yugoloth .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to its leather outfit, Malika once owned a censer of blood , a magic item that allowed it to create vampiric mists to serve it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While on Cube 1717, Malika was a prisoner of Vargo and was kept in its own room, guarded by two pixelated merregons . Malika wished to recover its censer of blood and escape Cube 1717.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vargo was unable to attach Malika's head to its own body because of the potent diseases it contained. So the skull lord hoped to get Malika to control one face of the Six-Face Throne if it could not find three more suitable heads for itself. Malika had learned almost all of Vargo's secrets.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The rulers of Acheron hired yugoloths to destroy Cube 1717, a part of Acheron that had become the source of the powerful pixelating curse. The yugoloths attempted to drown it in water from the Styx , but the cube escaped to the material plane and landed in the Sea of Swords on Toril . In order to finish the job, Malika was chosen to lead a group of yugoloths to finally destroy Cube 1717. They arrived on Face 5 of Cube 1717. A merrenoloth who commanded the group used ritual magic to summon water from the Styx in an attempt to isolate the Cube. Malika used its censer of blood to create seven vampiric mists and ordered them to kill anyone who tried to leave the Cube by flight. The yugoloths fought against the pixelated balhannoth controlled by Vargo and Sladek . In the fight, Malika lost its censer of blood .</p>
<p>However, the mission failed and most of the yugoloths were slain. Malika survived by surrendering to Vargo and three hydroloths remained in the Styx water still surrounding Cube 1717.</p>
