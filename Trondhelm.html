<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thelgaar Ironhand , the King of Oman for the first half of the 14 th century DR , was born in Trondhelm.</p>
<p>The castle of Caer Windlauer was once located along the coast at Trondhelm until sometime before the mid-14 th century DR when its occupant, Omar Mc Dauphin , used a ring of three wishes to wish for total isolation so that he and his family would never be robbed or harmed. Among other unintended consequences, the spell caused the entire castle and estate to be thrown into Realmspace . Once the estate was launched into wildspace , the ocean water filled the space left behind, creating Iron Keep Bay .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , King Dagdar of Moray was slain when he led an assault against Trondhelm.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The village was initially a stronghold of the Northmen , but like the rest of the settlements on Oman's Isle, Trondhelm was overrun and ruled by giants by the later part of the 15 th century DR.</p>
