<p>Petrylloc's Gambit was a spellcasting strategy that created various magic walls to surround and fall upon a target, using primarily defensive spells in an offensive manner.</p>
<p>Khelben Arunsun tried to get his father, Arun Maerdrym , to use the Gambit with him against a group of phaerimm that were attacking the elder's new elven family, but the older mage had no idea what his more educated son meant by the term.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years later, the Gambit was used in a group casting in 1374 DR by Khelben and the wizards Sememmon and Ashemmi to defeat a sharn at the Sleeping Dragon inn.</p>
