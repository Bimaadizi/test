<p>Vrestus Honore was a renowned poet from the city of Neverwinter , whose seminal works were written some years before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vrestus Honore was considered to be a prolific poet by some. One of his works â€“ a poem called Winter Enervation to Spring Innovation was kept in the grand library within the West Caraway Acres , the manse of a famous dragonborn wizard named Torlinn Shrake . It was said that the Winter Enervation was the pride of the mage's collection, so much so that it was recited for the bored guests during Torlinn's last grand ball in the late 15 th century DR. The recited poem was only three verse-long, a small excerpt from the grander work of poetry.</p>
<p>Vrestus' work was later used as a puzzle hint for the dragonborn's death dungeon underneath the West Caraway Acres, where some unwitting guests and staff members ended up at every party.</p>
