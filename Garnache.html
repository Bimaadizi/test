<p>A garnache was a type of outer-garment found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The garnache was best described as being a sort of long cloak with wide cape -like, elbow-length sleeves. It covered the wearer from their neck down to their ankles. The sleeve design of a garnache allowed bulky items (like pouches or weapons) to be hidden beneath them without attracting attention to the wearer.</p>
