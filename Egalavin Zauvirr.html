<p>Egalavin Zauvirr was a noble of House Zauvirr that joined Bregan D'aerthe in the early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Egalavin hailed from House Zauvirr in Ched Nasad . In 1018 DR , he was one of the few true followers of matron mother Sheeva Zauvirr that followed her after she was exiled from Ched Nasad. However, Jarlaxle , Arathis Hune , and Zaknafein were hired to kill Sheeva and lured Sheeva's group, including Egalavin, into a trap. During the fighting, only Egalavin and two other males survived and Jarlaxle offered them a chance to join the growing Bregan D'aerthe.</p>
<p>In 1488 DR , Egalavin, together with Braelin Janquay , acted as support for the resurrected Zaknafein at Bregan D'aerthe's meeting with House Hunzrin in the Waterdeep sewers.</p>
