<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Chamberlain Mercer, the man in charge of Lady Firelia Jannath 's staff, dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders. Mercer placed Cyrilla, the linen washer, Furbleston , Bailey , Jooli , Phubbs , and Chef Marjoram on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.</p>
<p>She worked hard scrubbing, polishing, and cleaning for Lady Jannath, hoping to eventually make the mistress's private maid. However, all the hard work was unnoticed.</p>
