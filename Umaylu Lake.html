<p>Umaylu Lake was a lake in the Alpuk region of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Umaylu Lake was a very shallow lake, with an average depth of only a few feet. The water in the lake was toxic, due to bacteria from rotting organic material and a high amount of minerals that seeped into the lake from cracks on the lake bed. The water was so toxic that even coming into contact with the oder-less water led to poisoning.</p>
<p>Scattered throughout the shallow lake were dull-green pingos. The pingos, rising from 10‒100 ft (3‒30 m) in height, were composed of frozen water from the lake. Due to this, coming into contact with a pingo also led to poisoning.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Due to the high toxicity of the lake, no animals lived within the waters and was toxic to all creatures except tirichik . Tirichik bathed and relaxed in the lake, rolling around so the shallow water covered their entire body. If a tirichik spent more than three hours in the lake, its skin absorbed the toxic water and took on a green tinge. Its skin became poisonous to the touch for the next twenty four hours.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While there were no settlements along the lake, the hunters from the nearby village of Imajuvisik frequented the shores of the lake. They collected the poisonous ice to be used as ammunition for their garnok .</p>
