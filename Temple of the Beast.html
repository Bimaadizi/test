<p>The Temple of the Beast was a secret temple to Malar , the Beastlord, in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the 13 th century DR . It was concealed in a hidden under-cellar.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , a beast-cult of Malar based at the temple smuggled caged monsters into Elturel and unleashed them in the streets one night. Then they launched a Wild Hunt , hunting and killing the monsters, common folk, and Officers of the Watch alike. The next day, the Malarites were themselves hunted down in revenge. Captured Malarites, living and dead, were examined with magic to locate their lair. It took several days of bloody fighting to root the cultists out of the Temple of the Beast. As authorities finally reached the unholy altar, the high priest—with the Book of Fangs and Talons in hand—escaped with a blood teleport spell powered by the lives of sacrificial victims. The justiciaries were left frustrated.</p>
