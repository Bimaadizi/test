<p>The Everlund Pass was the road from Everlund to Silverymoon , which crossed the western end of the Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The rough trail ran roughly on the eastern side of the River Rauvin , sometimes hundreds of feet above the river, and it snaked far away from the rushing waters into dangerous hills.</p>
<h3>Travel Times and Distances</h3>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A little over half-way between Everlund and Silverymoon was the Moonwyvern Inn , a cozy place that didn't ask too many questions.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many monsters roamed the area surrounding the valley, but patrols from Silverymoon and Everlund mostly kept the path clear.</p>
