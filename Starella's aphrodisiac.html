<p>Starella's aphrodisiac was a type of magical , aromatic oil with a charming effect.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When a dose of this oil was worn, any creature that was of a similar race and the opposite sex that came within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the wearer became thoroughly enamored as if under the effect of a powerful charm. They may regard the wearer as an ally, a trusted friend, or a romantic interest who had to be protected and whose words or actions were viewed in the most favorable way. It was possible for a person to became so enamored that they became incredibly jealousy, seeing other people as rivals.</p>
<p>Doses remained effective anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, eventually evaporating. The state they induced in people lasted so long as they remained within the vicinity of the wearer.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>One possible ingredient for crafting Starella's aphrodisiac was the tears of a jilted lover.</p>
