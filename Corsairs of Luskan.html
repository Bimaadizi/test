<p>Corsairs of Luskan was a book dedicated to the infamous rulers of the northern city of Luskan , the piratical groups known as "Ships," printed sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Corsairs of Luskan began by conducting a detailed cultural analysis of the city, eventually focusing on its trade and the city's de facto rulers: the most diverse, cutthroat, and fractured cabal of pirates broken into groups known as "Ships." The book continued detailing the pirate organizations in immaculate detail, including a little-known fact that Ship Kurth was secretly controlled by a drow mercenary company .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , copies of Corsairs of Luskan were sold by Nansi Gretta at The Bibliophile bookshop in the Lower City and another copy was found on the shelves of the Open Hand Temple in the Rivington neighborhood of Baldur's Gate .</p>
