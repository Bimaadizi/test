<p>Canopic jars were a type of container used across many parts of the Realms to store preserved internal organs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These jars were typically made from pottery, like ceramics or clay , or carved from limestone . Many canopic jars were made to have the likeness of some type of animal, but some simply had religious hieroglyphs painted on or etched into them.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Canopic jars were considered to be an essential item for the creation of mummies and mummy lords . After being used to store a mummy's internal organs, the jars had to be kept in the same tomb as it. Some sages claimed that canopic jars stored the life force of a mummy, a relationship akin to a lich and their phylactery , and that destroying the jars could in turn destroy the mummy whose organs they preserved. Though others argued that this was not necessarily true of all mummies.</p>
<p>Beyond mummification, some used canopic jars simply for the purposes of burial or keeping organs preserved for later magical research, as was the case with the ancient star elves .</p>
