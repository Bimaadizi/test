<p>The Steelsky Liberators were a group of rebel crusaders and dragon slayers who fought to free the lands of Abeir from draconic oppression since ancient times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Steelsky Liberators were founded in ancient times on Abeir, when a group of rebel crusaders learned to use the power of an ancient divine blessing on the arambar that was granted to mortals to combat dragons. The group vowed to free those under the yoke of dragons and to watch over and protect the lands that were free of dragons. These rebels operated mainly in the lands of Laerakond .</p>
<p>After the Spellplague of Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the practices of the Steelsky Liberators spread into Faer没n when some of the dragonborn and genasi crusaders that survived this catastrophe were transported to the lands of Faer没n. They were among the founders of the kingdoms of Tymanther and Akan没l , and passed on their abilities to individuals that were seeking more power and knowledge to defeat dragons oppressing their lands.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The abilities of the Steelsky Liberators were of divine nature , and were focused to kill dragons or creatures of elemental nature. The practices of the Steelsky Liberators also granted a degree of resistance against charm and fear abilities.</p>
