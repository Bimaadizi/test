<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, he was leading his tribe into Undermountain in search of a rumored dragon when the mad half-elf mercenary Zarr appeared and killed their chieftain. Most of the kobolds believed Zarr to be the dragon in half-elf form. Grelpin did not agree but said nothing to avoid being killed. He served Zarr until the mercenary ordered Grelpin to face a basilisk . Instead he hid in his chamber, planning a way to escape.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Grelpin wanted to overthrow Zarr and the alliance with the goblins and proclaim himself as the new chieftain. As the tribe's priest, he couldn't abandon his fellows.</p>
