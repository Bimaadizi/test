<p>Rock Strained Ale was a variety of ale created by the dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff named Bowser in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rock Strained Ale was a great-tasting libation with high alcohol content. An important part of its creation was being "washed" through the rocks of Bowser's homeland. It was down during the ale's fermentation process. This often left Rock Strained Ale contaminated with pebbles. Because of that, it was recommended to never chug this drink.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast . The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking â€“ Dark Maiden Wine , to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making, including Rock Strained Ale.</p>
