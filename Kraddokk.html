<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , Kraddokk heard that a shrine to Annam at the peak of the tallest of the Greypeak Mountains had been desecrated. He traveled there, and found that it had been discovered by members of the Cult of the Dragon, who had been killed by the ice mephits that lived inside. He arrived after adventurers following the notes of the murdered treasure-hunter Veradda Stoor had discovered the shrine, and spoke to them about Annam and the Ordning. He judged the adventurers on whether they took treasure from the shrine or not, but did not intervene.</p>
