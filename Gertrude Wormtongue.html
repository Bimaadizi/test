<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Sisters of Fury joined Iceblood, the mysterious priest of Arctus , a demigod child of Auril and Garagos , in his crusade across Icewind Dale . The hags of Gertrude's coven established lairs across Icewind Dale and began weaving their spells and expanding influence over local monsters. Gertrude Wormtongue joined a tribe of verbeegs serving Iceblood, led by chieftain Slabhead . Despite joining with the demigod's followers, Gertrude knew that the bastard godling's actions were the manipulations of Auril the Snowmaiden herself. With the verbeegs, Gertrude claimed the town of Termalaine , after it was evacuated following a supernatural deadly blizzard. Iceblood erected a tower made of ice at the center of town, leaving Gertrude in change. Soon after, a famed hero of Icewind Dale, the barbarian Wulfgar stormed the tower, but was turned into solid ice. The hag admired the man's muscles and attractiveness and could not wait to devour the human once he thawed out.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Sisters of Fury arrived in Icewind Dale, the night hag named Agaza took residence in the Lonely Wood and did not like other hags encroaching on her territory. When the famed Hero of Neverwinter found Agaza's lair, she convinced them to hunt Gertrude and the Sisters down. Subsequently, the Hero and their comrades stormed Gertrude's tower and ended her evil via decapitation. The Sisters's heads were used by Agaza as sacrifices to perform a ritual that, as the Hero was led to believe, would restore their memories, but, in truth, used to summon Gorgomorz , the Daggerford 's Devil , back to the Prime Material plane .</p>
