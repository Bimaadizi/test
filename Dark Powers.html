<p>The Dark Powers were an unknown mystical force that had the ability to pull complete regions into the Shadowfell as well as corrupt many individuals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While nobody knew who or what the Dark Powers might have been, it was certain that once one got trapped within the Mists it was impossible to get out unless the Dark Powers allowed it. A few individuals existed who could surpass the Mists, and the Dark Powers grasp, including Vistani and mistriders such as Allisa .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Dark Powers could grant individuals, among other terrible gifts, immortality and great magical possession. The Dark Powers tailored a Domain of Dread for each of the evil individuals got pulled into the Mists .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dark Powers first created Barovia , pulling it out from another unknown world, making Strahd von Zarovich the first darklord .</p>
<p>The Dark Powers later brought many different individuals from Toril and other worlds including Krynn and Oerth , into the Mists, creating Domains of Dread for each. These included:</p>
<p>In the mid-1360s DR , two incursions of the Demiplane of Dread occurred near the city of Elturel . The first incursion led to an assassination attempt against the city's ruler Lord Dhelt after which a pair of Hellriders were drawn into the domain of Barovia while pursuing the would-be assassin. A second, larger incursion caused Dhelt to order two more (possibly the same two) Hellriders to enter Har'Akir , a desert Domain of Dread.</p>
