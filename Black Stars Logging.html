<p>Black Stars Logging was a collectively owned lumber mill in the town of Velarsburg , Harrowdale during the midâ€“14 th century DR . Ownership was shared among all of the woodcutters who were not part of the Torsyld family.</p>
<p>They worked with furniture makers within the town, who would display their fine work within their showcased products. These finely crafted items were quite popular in the Dragon Reach .</p>
<p>As was the practice in Velarsburg, each logger that worked out of the Black Stars yard learned how to specifically harvest, cut, and season only one, or at most a few, types of wood. They would then brand their wood with the company's logo, an arch of three black stars.</p>
