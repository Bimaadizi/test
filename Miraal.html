<p>Miraal was an aquatic elf spellcaster who was slain and transformed into a banshee in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a banshee, Miraal was undead and appeared as a spectral, once-beautiful elven woman with gills and a mess of tangled hair framing her twisted face. Her hands and feet were webbed, and her ghostly tattered clothes floated around her as if she was underwater.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Prior to her death, Miraal was an accomplished spellcaster, likely a druid , who was capable of casting the spell, awaken . As a banshee, she was incorporeal but possessed a terrifying appearance and a potentially fatal wail.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Her spellcasting focus was a magnificent and valuable opalescent conch shell. When she was murdered, this conch became an object of fixation, and only by getting it back could she be laid to rest.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In life, Miraal was known to awaken sea creatures and earn their loyalty. In death, she was bound to the place in which she was murdered, a tunnel-like sea cave, and was unable to travel more than 100 feet (30 meters) from either entrance. While she was as hateful as any banshee, her hatred was mostly directed toward her murderer, Moesko . She remained rational enough to attempt to bargain with adventurers , offering them safe passage in exchange for their promise to kill Moesko and return her conch shell spellcasting focus. However, she would relentlessly attempt to kill any who refused this offer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Miraal was present at the lighthouse on the Sword Coast North that would come to be known as the Tower of Storms when she was attacked and killed in a nearby cave by an anchorite of Talos named Moesko . The anchorite took Miraal's precious spellcasting focus and left her undead form to guard the cave, which happened to be the only land route leading to the lighthouse. Moesko then claimed the tower, transforming it into a temple to Talos , and used his magic to bewitch the beacon and lure ships to their doom on the rocks below the tower. Meanwhile, Miraal remained bound to the site where she had been killed, and raged at the anchorite but could not reach the tower to enact revenge. During this time, a giant crab whom she had awakened on a nearby beach began seeking someone who could help to release her spirit.</p>
