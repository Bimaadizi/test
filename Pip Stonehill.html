<p>Pip Stonehill was a young human boy who lived in Phandalin in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Pip liked to imagine himself as a hero, and idolized adventurers who helped his family and friends. He also enjoyed playing in the fields southeast of Phandalin.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Pip was the son of Toblen and Trilena Stonehill , the owners of the Stonehill Inn , and he had a younger sister named Tamara . He was friends with Carp Alderleaf .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Pip's friend, Carp , told him that he had found a secret tunnel in the woods. The child barely escaped from the Redbrands , who had been terrorizing the town. Pip would sometimes talk to patrons of the Stonehill Inn, and may have informed them about the secretive place his friend had found.</p>
<p>Not long after, Pip went missing while off playing on his own in the fields outside of town. He had spotted three encephalon gemmules and, thinking he should keep on eye on the strange monsters, he followed them for 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) until they became trapped in an old ruin known as Marthungrim's Home . Pip became worried that if he went home and left them there, they might escape and—at the same time—he might get in trouble for wandering so far from home. He ended up hunkering down behind a boulder to wait until nightfall to wait for help.</p>
<p>By 1496 DR , Pip was old enough to help his parents run the family inn.</p>
