<p>Mhairhetel , also known as the City of Renegades , was a small city in Serpentes situated at the southeastern tip of the Mhair Jungles . It was considered to be one of Faerûn 's most notorious pirate ports.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Mhairhetel was ruled by the Rhaunister family, which was made up of junior yuan-ti pureblood members of House Jennestas . By 1373 DR , the city's High Lord was Istasfis Nsaran , who attained the position by marrying the previous High Lord's widow.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Mhairhetel was defended from the Mhair Jungles' monsters and overland attacks by patrols of human-sized snakes stationed on the eastern side of the Guth Mountains and the east end of the Dolsel Gap .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Banished Wisdom, −125 DR , Mhairhetel was founded by the Halruaan archmage Hetel Hastalhorn , who sought to take advantage of the Mhair Jungles' hidden treasures. This initial chapter of the city was short-lived, however, and by the following year , its founder had disappeared and nearly the entire population abandoned the settlement.</p>
<p>Despite this initial misfortune, Mhairhetel's population quickly started growing again, supplemented by consistent waves of refugees seeking to escape their homelands, and by 1373 DR it had grown into a small but viable city with a population in the thousands.</p>
<p>Since several centuries before the 14 th , especially before the alliance between the Rundeen trade consortium and House Se'Sehen was forged after the Time of Troubles , Mhairhetel was thought of as a useful asset to the yuan-ti tribes of Serpentes as a unique conduit for trade with outlanders. The port's role as a common starting point for humans from the coasts of the Great Sea who wished to explore the Mhair Jungles was also seen as a convenient factor for surveillance.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Although the Rhaunister family's yuan-ti identity was kept secret, rumors about their ability to talk to snakes and the conduction of experiments to turn people into human-serpent hybrids ran rampant.</p>
