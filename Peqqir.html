<p>Peqqir was a city in the Plain of Horses of northeastern Kara-Tur . It was the home of the Guychiang tribe.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Peqqir stood in the taiga of the northern Plain of Horses, near the foot of the Chigidi Mountains and with the Anai River flowing past. A road following the river linked it to Mount Or-Ghash in the west and the other cities of the Plain of Horses in the east. Peqqir was surrounded by green forests and rolling hills, and enjoyed some of the most fertile farmland in the region.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Expert farmers and employing advanced irrigation methods, the Guychiang grew grains , vegetables , cotton , and mulberry trees, the leaves of which were used in the production of silk . In addition, they mined iron and jade from the nearby Chigidi Mountains and craftsmen manufactured weapons , quality jewelry, and leather products. All in all, Peqqir was perhaps the most industrious settlement in all the Plain of Horses as of Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Defense of their city was paramount to the Guychiang. To enter Peqqir, a traveler must pass through a succession of sibege , heavily fortified gates in the city wall. A squad of well-armed soldiers stood guard on each sibege . A permit issued by city officials and payment of a gate tax were required just to pass through one sibege .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After he first appeared in the Plain of Horses around Shou Year 2592 (1342 DR) , the nomad lama Torgoja P'a stopped in Peqqir, where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful inhabitants offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a passed on it and continued on his way. He would become High Lama of Mount Or-Ghash around Shou Year 2597 (1347 DR) .</p>
