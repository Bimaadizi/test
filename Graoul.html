<p>Graoul was a dragonborn elder of the Inquest and one of the rulers of Xorvintroth on Abeir . Graoul and their colleagues enjoyed a second life as their brains were preserved in jars following their deaths. Like the others, Graoul's consciousness remained as a spectral echo in the Astral Plane , even after their brain was consumed by a gnome ceremorph whose ship crashed upon Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Graoul's brain jar was set in a green metal casing wrought to resemble a dragon 's claw.</p>
<p>In the Astral Plane, Graoul's spectral echo wore robes adorned with astronomical imagery and arcane characters. Like the other elders, Graoul wore a metallic necklace with a medallion featuring crown of green crystals. Hovering atop their heads were those actual crowns, each of which granted a form of non-detection that hid them from roaming astral dreadnoughts .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Along with their fellow elders, Graoul's consciousness was transferred to a brain in a jar after their death. While studying the forces of the Far Realm , the elders' minds somehow became trapped in the Astral Plane. Some time after becoming stranded, they arranged for their physical remains and still-living brains to be transported to a different location in Xorvintroth.</p>
<p>While Graoul and the elders were in the Astral Plane, the mysterious Emissary of the Nine Eyes shared with them a 'viridian planet', a possible new home for them to live free from the constant war on Abeir. With this revelation, the Inquest began construction on the bridge of stars , a device that would allow them to travel away from Abeir. Unfortunately, their work would never be completed.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , a two gnome ceremorphs piloting the Id Ascendant through Realmspace crashed in the wastes of Icewind Dale . While searching for psi crystals to repower their ship, they stumbled upon the ruins of Xorvintroth―which had remained on Toril after the Second Sundering ―and recovered Graoul's brain jar. They proceeded to split Graoul's brain in half and enthusiastically consume all of his remains. Interestingly enough, his spectral echo remained in the Astral Plane.</p>
