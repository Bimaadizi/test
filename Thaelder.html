<p>Thaelder was the house wizard of the noble House Spurbright of Cormyr , and secretly a War Wizard in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Thaelder was in the employ of Elvarr Spurbright of the Spurbright family. Like many of the house wizards that worked for Cormyrean noble houses, Thaelder was a War Wizard spy, the fact that Elvarr Spurbright was aware of. Thaelder used his magics to ream the minds of the members of the Spurbright family nightly for any information deemed important by the War Wizards. Elvarr acquired several enchanted pieces of magecloak jewelry, priced at more than an entire tallhouse in Suzail . Thaelder could not access the nobleman's thoughts nor magically listen to his conversation when magecloak was worn.</p>
<p>Elvarr Spurbright and his son Torsard Spurbright discussed the rumored corruption of the Dragon Crown â€“ Royal Family Obarskyr , shielded by magecloaks from Thaelder's surveillance.</p>
