<p>Annathe was a member of the Moonclaws gang of Athalantar during the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Annathe participated in the Moonclaws's burglary of the Trumpettower home after the wedding of Peeryst Trumpettower and Nanue Glarmeir in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR . However, a rival gang, the Velvet Hands , attempted the same burglary at the same time and Darrigo Trumpettower intervened and fought them. In the aftermath of the ensuing struggle, Farl , leader of the Velvet Hands, accounted for Annathe and others of the Moonclaws as almost certainly lost (whether he meant dead, injured, or captured was not explicit), thus thinning the numbers of the Moonclaws.</p>
