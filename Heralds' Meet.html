<p>Heralds' Meet was a plaza located in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Heralds' Meet was a large, open commons area paved with flagstones, distinguished by ten ship masts that have been firmly embedded to a depth of 5 feet (1.5 meters) to prevent tampering. Affixed to these wooden columns were a variety of scraps and full sheets of parchment and vellum , displaying notices posted by those either seeking employment or looking to hire workers. The details of these postings were often deliberately vague, particularly from prospective employers.</p>
<p>The Heralds' Meet served as a hub where individuals could join the crew of a ship, hire sailors or mercenaries for bodyguard duties, or scout for general employment opportunities. Given that a significant number of Skullport’s residents were illiterate, three or four professional scribes were regularly present, offering to read the notices aloud for a fee of one copper piece per page, or a dozen pages for one silver piece .</p>
<p>Individuals seeking mundane or adventuring work were often approached here by representatives of potential employers. Preliminary interviews typically took place over drinks at the nearby Black Tankard tavern, where negotiations and discussions about the job in question were further explored.</p>
