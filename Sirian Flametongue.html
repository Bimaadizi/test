<p>Sirian Flametongue was a hot-headed young red dragon , spawn of Tam , who, unlike his mother, willingly and gladly allied himself with Lolth in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1370 DR, the red dragon Tam was convinced to join the High Priestess of Lolth, Azurna , in Undermountain during her pursuit of Waterdeep 's destruction. Her hatchlings were used by the drow as powerful allies. One of the young dragons who gladly joined the malicious plot was Sirian Flametongue. Old enough to be a powerful agent, the dragon attacked the adventurer who infiltrated the drow stronghold while investigating the plot against the City of Splendors. The dragon was slain in the ensuing confrontation.</p>
