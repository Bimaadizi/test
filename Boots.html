<p>Boots were a piece of armor (or clothing) used for defending the feet and lower legs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boots came in several types (such as high, low, hard, and soft), and could be enchanted. Riding boots were used by adventurers when riding mounts.</p>
<p>Those who wore magical boots must wear the pair (one on each foot) to receive the benefits. Oddly matched boots provided no benefit.</p>
<p>Plate armor , which covered almost all of the body, included heavy leather boots. Climber's kits came with boot tips to make scaling mountainous slopes much more easy. Smuggler's boots had hinged heels with hidden compartments, where thin objects such as alchemical vials , maps or even slender daggers could be stored. The inside linen could also hold similar hidden compartments.</p>
