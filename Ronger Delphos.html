<p>Ronger Delphos was a merchant and the founder of an anti-thieves' guild of Waterdeep some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Ronger Delphos attempted to create an antiâ€“thieves' guild in the City of Splendors by hiring thieves as security experts for his organization, which involved guarding Waterdhavian merchants. Ronger Delphos's recruits were armed with magic wands that dispensed a hold person spell . To counter this, Waterdeep's thieves' guilds purchased many belts of agility . This led to an escalation of the guild war between the thieves and Ronger Delphos's guards.</p>
