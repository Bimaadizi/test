<p>Bone whelks were massive mollusks native to the plane of Avernus in the Nine Hells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They exuded an adhesive secretion that gathered debris from the path over which they dragged their body. All the skulls, bones, and other organic waste material they passed over collected on the topside of their body, forming a sort of protective shell.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other similar creatures, bone whelks could easily crawl along the sides of structures or on ceilings with ease.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Bone whelks pulled themselves along the landscape of the hells, in search of organic material to consume and assimilate onto their form.</p>
<p>When slain, bone whelks let out a horrifying screech that caused organic material to rot. This had the additional effect of often attracting scavenging fiends .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were regularly preyed upon by flying vrocks .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the late 15 th century DR , numerous bone whelks could be found scouring the surfaces of wrecked flying fortresses on Avernus.</p>
