<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , cloaks of protection versus good could be found in Neverwinter , all across the Sword Coast North , and in the Moonsea region. Many of these enchanted cloaks were commissioned by General Menthan Calcoler of the notorious Black Network . He planned on outfitting the entirety of Zhentarim army with these items but was assassinated by a Harper spy before he could roll the plan out. The deceased General's plan of marching into the Dalelands was not embraced by his successor and neither were these numerous cloaks paid for. The wizards responsible for the items' creation ended up selling them to recoup their hefty financial losses.</p>
