<p>Gulkuluster's deathstaff was an extremely powerful quarterstaff , that could create unique spell effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This artifact was created by Gulkuluster , one of the most powerful wizards of Halruaa , as a means to destroy any potential foe.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The deathstaff created effects that mimicked a fireball spell that had a larger area-of-effect and was exceptionally more destructive. It expanded this power with other elements, and could produce a frostball , electricity ball , acidball , sonicball in a similar manner. Using any of these abilities expended one of the staff's 50 charges.</p>
<p>It was also unique in that the deathstaff regained one charge every week. If all the charges were used, it became nonfunctional for one week.</p>
