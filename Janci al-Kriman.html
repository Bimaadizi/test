<p>Janci al-Kriman was a camel trader within the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Janci procured livestock for many of the animal dealers in the City of Delights. Though he specialized in camels, he branched out into other beasts of burden as well. If a customer had 10,000 dinar they could even purchase one of Janci's rare hippogriffs .</p>
<p>Janci always turned thieves over to the authorities, earning him a reputation that kept most from thinking twice about attempting the act.</p>
<p>Rare among merchants, Janci extended lines of credit to his buyers if they required it.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Janci owned an amulet of animal control that allowed him complete control of any animal he touched. His possession of this amulet was the only reason Janci extended credit to his buyers, knowing that he could recall one of his animals at any time, even from great distances, if the buyer was delinquent. He also used the amulet to return animals mistreated by their owners since they were warned that this would happen before the sale.</p>
