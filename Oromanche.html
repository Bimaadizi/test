<p>Oromanche was a wealthy merchant family from the walled town of Mosstone that laid along the Trade Way in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Oromanche family was known to be bombastic and flamboyant people. They had "dark, lush good looks," were bold and daring, and had whirlwinds of alleged and real romances and trysts around the House's reputation. Maerele Oromanche was the matriarch of the merchant family circa 1449 DR . She was good friends with Elminster Aumar . Maerele Oromanche had three significantly younger siblings involved in the family's trade: Elklund , Imraphar , and Odyle . Other siblings included Olora , Emruelle , and Haladeira . Two more family members of note were Maerele's female cousins Jhassala and Nurimbrue .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Oromanches made a fortune by importing a variety of goods from the cities of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep . All of these goods were exotic and not readily available in Tethyr, allowing the Oromanche merchants to charge exuberant prices. Some of the more prominent goods made available by the Oromanches were liqueurs , wines , cheeses , perfumes , and aromatics.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The family rose to prominence in the 15 th century DR , and by the Year of the Godly Invitation, 1449 DR , Oromanches had power, wealth, and status. They were rivals of the Alkaether merchant family that rose around the same time, however, neither of the two families had active enemies or ongoing feuded, and their rivalry was casual.</p>
<p>In 1449 DR, a mysterious flying Sword of Spells ended a life of a wizard hired by the Oromanche family. The weapon flew through a slot-like vent and stabbed the wizard in the process of ensorcelling the family's home in Mosstone with protective dweomers . Many similar murders were committed by the Sword of Spells until its reign of terror across the Realms ended in the spring of the Year of the Emerald Sun, 1454 DR and suddenly as it started.</p>
