<p>Jade Panther was an infamous monk from the nation of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur , active some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jade Panther's infamy came from the use of special gloves —the Claws of the Jade Panther —that were adorned with razor-sharp blades to savage his opponents more effectively. Finally, Jade Panther's consort, Li Mei , grew disgusted with the monk's cruelty, stole the Claws of the Jade Panther , and tasked her servant with destroying the gloves once and for all. But Jade Panther's torturous implements were not destroyed, and, instead, ended up on the black market.</p>
