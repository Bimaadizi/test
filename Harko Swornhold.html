<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harko was exiled from Waterdeep in the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , for attempting to bribe a magistrate. Three years later, he returned to the city illegally, where he began recruiting kenku thugs in the Dock Ward and using them to incite violence. He soon came to the attention of the Lords' Alliance , who suspected that he was on the payroll of the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . Thus, the Alliance's Jalester Silvermane planned to send an agent to quietly eliminate him.</p>
