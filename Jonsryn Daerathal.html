<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Magister Jonsryn Daerathal was a debauched man best known for hunting sorcerous rivals, and for other indiscriminate assassinations of mages, which spared neither senior court mages nor fledglings: he often resorted to poison, or to crushing them with translocated boulders in their sleep. He moved continuously throughout his career, and the killings did not stop nor slow down during his tenure as the Magister, which earned him the ire of Mystra . Despite her sending him nightmares of an afterlife where fiends would eat his limbs again and again, from which he often woke up screaming, he never slowed down until his death in 902 DR , when he was vaporized by Taline Telgara . He smiled as he died.</p>
