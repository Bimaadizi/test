<p>The Watch was the civil constabulary of Baldur's Gate who patrolled and protected the citizens of its Upper City . They were headquartered within the Watch Citadel , the grand keep that served as their logistical launch point and housed their training grounds, located in the appropriately named Citadel Streets district.</p>
<p>Unlike the Flaming Fist , who acted as soldiers and fought against threats both domestic and abroad, the Watch had limited authority and could not act outside the city proper.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A typical shift for a member of the Watch was eight hours long. Duties included standing sentry upon the Upper City's walls, going on regular patrols, training within the Citadel or carrying out the daily duties required to maintain such a robust police force. They were known for enforcing the curfew that was maintained in the Upper City, clearing folks out of the streets and most notably, within the Wide at dusk.</p>
<p>Watch members were easily recognizable among the passers-by of the Upper City and took pride in knowing the face of every resident within. They understood the behavior and mannerisms of the Baldurian patriar and were skilled at identifying those who did not belong. They issued stamped-and-numbered badges, made of wood or silver , to each person who was a guest of any Upper City resident and kept a close eye on their activities.</p>
<p>Officers of the watch assisted the Bailiff of the Wide during their morning duties and provided security within the grand marketplace.</p>
<p>When the most dire emergencies arose, those that may have threatened the entirety of the Upper City, the bells of the Citadel and those in High Hall were rung simultaneously for a quarter-hour. In these rare instances, Watch members were expected to rally at the Citadel or stand guard atop the walls of the Upper City.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>There were nine distinct ranks within the Watch. In ascending order they were:</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The total strength of the Watch numbered approximately 1000, with approximately 300 watchmen active at any given time. Their ranks included a small corps of elite knights , who were granted permission to ride atop their warhorses within the city's walls.</p>
<p>Watch members were allowed to live within the districts of the Upper City, alongside the patriar and other wealthy and influential Baldurians. Membership within the Watch was often handed down, from generation to the next.</p>
