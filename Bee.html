<p>Beekeeping, a practice of keeping and tending to domesticated bees in return for the products they made, mainly honey , was very common throughout the Realms, wherever the climate allowed. This practice often involved a tool known as a beehive , an artificial structure for bees to live in.</p>
<p>Some notable places where beekeeping was practiced included the town of Eveningstar , the city-state of Neverwinter , and the plane of Dothion ,</p>
<p>Other products of bees that other creatures harvested included beeswax and a resin mixture known as propolis , which among other things could be used to make a varnish.</p>
