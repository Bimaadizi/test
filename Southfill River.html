<p>The Southfill River was a river in central Netheril that descended from the Lodestar Mountains and emptied into Hidden Lake .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river originated in the southern Lodestar Mountains near Hatchet Mountain , wound across the plains, passed Canlespiere and through the Hidden Forest until it flowed into Hidden Lake.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fertile lands along the river were home to the ogres of Chanth , who were assaulted and overtaken by expansionist Netherese settlers in 1004 NY (−2855 DR) . This began an eight-hundred-year period of war and skirmishes between the humans and ogres, culminating in the appearance of the ogre mage Storm . The north shore of the river was the site of the final great battle between a team of Netherese arcanists and Storm in 1810 NY (−2049 DR) , and though it was unclear if Storm was slain, he and his ogres never returned.</p>
