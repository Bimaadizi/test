<p>A harmonic dueler was an enchanted rapier designed to be wielded by charismatic individuals prone for flourishes and showmanship in battle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Harmonic dueller possessed a minor +1 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and boosted its damage. This blade vibrated and thrummed pleasantly once unsheathed. It shivered in a way reminiscent of an actor, nervous before hitting the stage. This enchantment was known as mellow harmony – it allowed a charismatic wielder to increase the blade efficiently.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a harmonic dueler could be found in Danthelon's Dancing Axe 's inventory, among mostly mundane items in stock.</p>
