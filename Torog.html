<h2>History</h2>
<p>A short time before the Dawn War , Torog faced a terrible primordial of the Underdark on his own. While Torog was victorious and was able to kill it, the primordial managed to curse him, binding him to the Underdark and making him unable to heal from his wounds. Maimed and disfigured, Torog crawled across the Underdark searching for a way to the surface, breaking the dimensional boundaries that keep the Underdark separated from the Feywild and the Shadowfell in the process. Torog eventually managed to reach the surface world, but discovered that his powers were now tied to the Underdark and if he ever left it he would become powerless. Torog remained trapped in the Underdark ever since. Some people believed the World Serpent played a role in Torog's imprisonment.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , many surface folk incorrectly believed that Torog had faded away into myth; however, some people, like Elminster , reported that Torog was lurking in the Lowerdark below Faer√ªn .</p>

<p>Some people believed that if someone spoke the name of Torog, the god would burrow from below and drag the speaker underground, where they would be imprisoned and tortured forever.</p>
