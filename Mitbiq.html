<p>The mitbiq ( pronounced : / m ɪ t ˈ b i k / miht-BEEK ) was an interesting Zakharan wind instrument that appeared to be two instruments in one.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mitbiqs were double clarinets made from reed tubes. Each of the clarinet tubes was complimented by a smaller tube that vibrated to create sound.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A mitbiq required a great deal of practice to master because it involved inhaling on one clarinet and then exhaling on the other, allowing for continuous tone production.</p>
