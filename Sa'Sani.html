<p>Sa'Sani was a yuan-ti princess of the Sauringar tribe on the Chultan Peninsula and a priestess of Sseth in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sa'Sani had sharp facial features and an alluring appearance. Despite it and her haughty attitude, she had a serious demeanor and steeled determination, and she expected results from her employees and associates.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Apart from being a talented merchant, Sa'Sani was a capable wizard .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The famed writer and traveler Volothamp Geddarm became infatuated with Sa'Sani during the mid-1370s DR when he was involved with her merchant company. Although she did not encourage him in any way and remained cool and haughty, Sa'Sani was aware of his attraction and occasionally shared her dry wit with him. Her blood magic ritual also bound them together, putting a tiny piece of her inside him so that, if she died, she would slowly drain life from Volo and regenerate her own body and return to life. An unexpected side-effect was that she regularly received his thoughts, albeit in a jumbled, broken order. It helped her keep track of Volo and his activities. An even more unexpected side-effect was that with time, Sa'Sani became infatuated with Volo too.</p>
<p>When Volo rescued Nanthé Ryddorn , a War Wizard , and they became friends and occasional lovers, Sa'Sani thought Nanthé to be useful and showed no signs of jealousy towards the lady mage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , yuan-ti followers of Sseth were tasked with infiltrating mercantile organizations of the Sword Coast in order to fill the void in trade left by the Shadow War and spread the snake god's influence and become the shadow rulers of the region. Sa'Sani helmed the Mercantile House , the most successful trading company in Samarach , diligently spreading the influence of her house into the Sword Coast through her associates in the Crossroad Keep .</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, House Se'Sehen betrayed Sseth and House Sauringar by pledging their allegiance to the interloper deity Zehir . The yuan-ti of House Se'Sehen started attacking the Sauringar, slaughtering many and taking control of the Temple of World Serpent . And unbeknownst to Sa'Sani, her loyal business associates started sabotaging the Mercantile House. A group of adventurers, along with Sa'Sani's business associate, famed Volothamp Geddarm, sailed from the Sword Coast to Samarach aboard the Vigilant . Luaire Farwander , a merchant under the employ of Sa'Sani, secretly a yuan-ti pureblood of Zehir, was onboard the ship and successfully caused its wreck through sabotage. Suspicious of the ship's destruction, Sa'Sani hired the adventurers for their own protection from the xenophobic Samarachans and to pursue her won goals. She sent the heroes to investigate the shipwreck under the false pretense of insurance investigation. Eventually, the investigation led to Luaire's exposure and death.</p>
<p>When the news of Luaire Farwander being a dreaded yuan-ti reached the Elite Guard of Samargol , Sa'Sani claimed that even association with the scaled menace was dangerous for her business. Captain Dajos promptly informed Sa'Sani that due to her association with the snake-folk , she was to leave Samargol by the following day's sunset and not return while the yuan-ti menace was investigated. Her authority was withdrawn by the Council, and the Mercantile House's control – was given to Osi Tchaluka . Sa'Sani used her contacts with the gnomes who ran the Lantan-Samarach portal to flee to the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast, away from Samargol's laws. There, with the help of the adventurers, Sa'Sani continued growing her mercantile empire and continued investigation into strange disappearances of her allies, and numerous sabotages of trade along the Sword Coast. As a talented merchant, Sa'Sani knew that profiteering off of Neverwinter's crumbling economy after the Shadow War would only damage the economic balance of the region. Instead, she sought to boost the trade to reach her long-term goals, including restoring her good standing with Samarach via bribes.</p>
<p>Her first order was for the adventurers to establish contact and partnership with one of the most prominent merchant operations at the time – the Circle of Friends , the Forgotten Lords , or the Fated Winds of Neverwinter's Temple of Waukeen . All three groups worked with Sa'Sani's business associates whose operations she took over in Crossroads Keep. The adventurers were to find information on the associates' disappearance, eventually leading them to uncover the Snaketongue cult 's conspiracy. Subsequently, Sa'Sani manipulated them into attacking and destroying House Se'Sehen, which was behind the Snaketongue cultists' attempt to take over the Sword Coast's commerce.</p>
<p>Under Sa'Sani's leadership, her Mercantile House established trading posts in settlements near Crossroads Keep, including Highcliff , Thundertree , Phandalin , Leilon , and Neverwinter .</p>
