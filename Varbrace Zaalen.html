<p>Varbrace Zaalen was a skilled warrior and follower of Tempus inhabiting Waterdeep , the City of Splendors, during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . By 1368 DR , a Captain-at-Arms competitor of his was Myrmith Splendon . Circa 1372 DR , he became unknown.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Varbrace Zaalen was a short, feisty, muscular man at 5 feet 5 inches, but any who doubt his fighting skill were soon laid out flat on the ground, facing the point of his sword. He had the symbol of Tempus tattooed on his left arm.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Slightly unkempt but very amiable, Varbrace was proud of the tattoo of Tempus's symbol on his left arm, and shown it, with his muscular physique, off every chance he got. Varbrace would not go on adventures -- he considered the risks too high for the potential profits.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Varbrace earned a living as a "captain-at-arms", instructing others in the ways of the sword . He refused to continue teaching anyone who tried to cheat him unless the were very apologetic and paid double the normal fees. He trained his students in a quiet corner of the City of the Dead , or just outside of the River Gate if the guards interfered. Varbrace rented a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger in the Trades Ward .</p>
<p>Circa 1368 DR , barmaids at the Dripping Dagger placed bets how soon Varbrace would challenge someone to an armwrestle match as soon as he entered the Inn.</p>
