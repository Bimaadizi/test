<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sauvrurn and Thandro discussed their involvement in a future assassination attempt on Filfaeril Obarskyr and Alusair, respectively queen and princess regent of Cormyr , in 1373Â DR . He was reticent to do much, but Thandro reassured him enough to get him to participate in the planned assassination. He had gathered five minor baubles in advance, and could muster twelve swordsmen; he was instructed to head for a lamppost near Thelvarspike Lane in advance of their attack on Thundaerlyn Hall . Their discussion happened in a warehouse full of Selgauntan glowstones , which prevented them from being scried on, but unknown to them, two merchants and fugitives, Malakar Surth and Bezrar were eavesdropping on them.</p>
