<p>The Simbul was, in ancient times, the title given to a Yuir power whom some described as the goddess of "the edge and the moment of choice."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Simbul, like all the Yuir powers, was worshiped first by primitive humans who dwelled in the Yuirwood , then by the Yuir elves that came to live there, and was later forgotten.</p>
<p>However, around midnight on Eleasis 25 in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the queen of Aglarond who had become her better-known namesake, the Simbul , had a conversation with her even as a battle raged in the Sunglade .</p>
