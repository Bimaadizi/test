<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , all the tieflings of Elturel were cast out of the city, following its brief descent into the Nine Hells . Zorru was among the refugees who began to follow Zevlor , an exiled cavalryman from Elturel's Hellriders . The group traveled west towards the great metropolis of Baldur's Gate , but were beset by goblin war bands during their journey. They managed to find refuge at the Emerald Grove for a time, though it was hardly an ideal situation. Zorru remained anxious that more goblins would siege the druid 's grove and endanger himself and his fellow tieflings.</p>
