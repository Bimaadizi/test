<p>Simon Weems was an unfortunate insurance salesman from the settlement of Lake Geneva in the land of Wisconsin on Earth who briefly traveled to Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a short beard and mustache and wore glass spectacles , a strange gray fabric outfit in three pieces, a brightly colored strip of cloth knotted around his neck like a noose, highly polished black leather short boots , and a gold bracelet. This outlandish appearance prompted the locals of Havenmere to assume he was some sort of demon , monster, or harbinger of death.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>During his time on Toril, Weems was confused and helpless, not fully understanding where he was or what had happened.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Weems was a rather sedentary and unfit man, unused to physical labor or exertion. He required a specific "amino acid" in his diet that was not found on Toril, meaning his life there would be short. It isn't clear if this was unique to Weems or if other Earth born individuals might suffer from the same deficiency.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Weems had a variety of odd implements on his person, including a stopped wrist-clock called a "Rolex", an inert "pager", and a gold pen with an empty internal ink reservoir worth about 1 gp .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , a spontaneous gate transported Simon Weems to Toril along with a creature called the Demon , appearing in the village of Havenmere . The villagers took him for a monster and quickly subdued the confused planeswalker , tying him up to be burnt on a pyre. Before he could be turned to ash, he was rescued by passing adventurers who proceeded to investigate the situation, with the assistance of the learned local Senecus .</p>
<p>In his youth, Senecus had worked for a wizard as a cleaner and assistant and the mage had enjoyed discussing arcane topics with him. This meant that, though he didn't have powers of his own he had a broad, if shallow, understanding of magic. He was struck by the resemblance of the event to a "spontaneous gate" , a naturally-formed gate that appears and transfers something from one world to another, with an "equivalent exchange" in the opposite direction. He further noted that the event involved two worlds connecting to a third, creating a "vector balance" between the two planar travelers. He surmised that if Weems and the Demon were reunited together, the gates would reform and send both of them home.</p>
<p>Presuming that the "vector balance" was in effect between Weems and the Demon, the adventurers quested forth to capture the beast, ideally reuniting the two and sending the both of them home to their respective planes.</p>
