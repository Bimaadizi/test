<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1310 DR , Madae of the Legion of the Chimera ordered one of her most talented weapon-smiths to craft the weapon at the Severed Hand in the Spine of the World . Once it was finished, she had it placed in the hands of a statue of Iyachtu Xvim, both to honor the Godson and to arm his avatar should he one day appear. This happened when adventurers came to defeat them. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , this replica ended up in the hands of Agaza , the night hag who tormented Lonelywood with sleepless nights and nightmares.</p>
