<p>A dire wolf was an ancient dire version of a grey wolf , being a larger and more primitive or feral breed of wolf. Dire wolves were favored by the gods Garagos and Ilneval .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dire wolves grew to about 9 feet (2.7 meters) long and weighed up to 800 lb (360 kg), about the size of a horse . They had thick fur that was mottled grey or black in color, and they had eyes like fire.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Dire wolves were far more aggressive than normal wolves, attacking and killing anything they could catch. They can be found singly as lone wolves or in packs numbering five to eight dire wolves.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They could generally be found in temperate forest environments, such as the Starwood the Silver Marches , and the Toadsquat Mountains . However some were occasionally encountered in colder environments, such as the North Country of Rashemen or within some caves found throughout Icewind Dale .</p>
<p>Dire wolves were occasionally kept by hill giants , members of the Gray Wolf tribe of the Uthgardt people, and Black Blood cultists . A leash and collar made for a dire wolf cost 8 sp from Aurora's Emporium , as of the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They had keen senses, including a sharp sense of smell, allowing them to track their prey by scent. They could also move stealthily on the hunt.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Dire wolves fought in packs, fighting efficiently and surrounding their prey and flanking it to gain an advantage. Their bite was their only weapon, but they could drag a creature to the ground once they had gotten a hold of them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Conner and a young boy were traveling on a moor when fog swept in and they were beset by starving dire wolves. However, before the beasts closed in for the kill, a shaft of moonlight transported them to Waterdeep .</p>
