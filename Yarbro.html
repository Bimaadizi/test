<p>Yarbro was a male human soldier living in Shadowdale in the Dalelands during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was a guardsman that protected Lord Mourngrym Amcathra at the Twisted Tower of Ashaba .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was known for being rather over-eager in his duties guarding Shadowdale's lord, despite numerous conversations outlining the parameters of his duties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , Lord Mourngrym's guardsmen found Yarbro with no money and few possessions on the borders of ruined Myth Drannor . Within two years, the formerly down-and-out man had himself a position as one of those very guards stationed at the Twisted Tower.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , he was guarding the gates of the city when the company of Midnight and Kelemvor Lyonsbane arrived before Bane 's assault. He had a great antipathy for the four adventurers.</p>
<p>He survived the Battle of Shadowdale .</p>
<p>When Midnight and Adon , accused of killing Elminster , escaped with the aid of Cyric , the Lord of Shadowdale chose Yarbro and Kelemvor to lead an expedition to recapture them. The company managed to recapture the fugitives but at that point Kelemvor fell victim to his curse and killed most of the men.</p>
<p>Yarbro escaped with some other men and found Cyric. Yarbro's bad mood convinced Cyric of his decision, and he manipulated the Dalesmen into believing that he was only a victim of Adon and Midnight.</p>
<p>Later, the Company of the Scorpions met and killed most of the surviving Dalesmen. Only Yarbro and Cyric remained; Cyric revealed his evil deeds and killed Yarbro in cold blood.</p>
