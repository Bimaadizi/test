<p>Sharwyn was a human bard originally from the city of Neverwinter in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sharwyn was described as a stunningly beautiful woman. She had long luscious brown hair, brown eyes, light skin, and vice like honeyed mead .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was fascinated with music and stories and had a case of hero-worship when meeting Drogan Droganson's pupil . Sharwyn carried herself with confidence and had a haughty gaze.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sharwyn was born to a family in Neverwinter. Her father perished early, and the widowed mother squandered the inheritance on a lavish lifestyle. Trying to reacquire wealth through her daughter's bed, Sharwyn's mother tasked the young woman with seducing a lord. However, at a party where she was to seduce the noble, Sharwyn fell in love with a poor bard instead. The couple tried to keep the affair a secret but was forced to run away when it came to light. Sharwyn, following her heart, embittered her mother and forever ruined their relationship. The mother felt like Sharwyn abandoned her and remained resentful even when Sharwyn tried to reconnect. Years later, Sharwyn attempted to cure her mother when she was on her deathbed by seeking the celestial elixir .</p>
<p>Subsequently, Sharwyn's relationship with the poor bard came to an end, too. The couple traveled the countryside together for many years until, one day, they were summoned to entertain a famous king and queen. The king was a corpulent man who had no appreciation for the arts but the queen was a beautiful young lass who set her eyes on Sharwyn's beloved. The bard couple became favorites of the court and were invited to move into the castle. Still, soon, as the young bard's private performances for the queen grew in frequency, Sharwyn began suspecting a love affair – the suspicion that soon was confirmed. Heartbroken, Sharwyn fled, leaving her young bard behind in the queen's embrace. Sadly, Sharwyn soon discovered that the infidelity was the result of a spell cast by the queen – an illusion that hid the queen's girth and advanced age. Sharwyn vowed to break the queen's magic and expose her true self, not because she still loved the young bard but because she craved vengeance. To counter her magic, Sharwyn needed to find a lock of nymph 's hair.</p>
<p>The Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR saw Sharwyn returning to the Jewel of the North, the city of Neverwinter, where she became a part of the events that led to ending the outbreak of the Wailing Death plague . Along with several other heroes, Sharwyn was hired by Aribeth de Tylmarande on behalf of Lord Nasher, offering her adventuring prowess to the Hero of Neverwinter , and became involved in the subsequent investigation and the Neverwinter- Luskan war. Her main drive in the adventure was a search for a story; she would attempt to weave stories of the Hero of Neverwinter and the Betrayer, Aribeth de Tylmarande, albeit unsuccessfully. Sharwyn's quest led her to discover a story of an elven man Tamorlyn . The elf lived a happy life with his wife and children but left them to go on a quest to discover what was missing from his heart. He pursued the goddess of love and eventually found her, imploring the deity to reveal the true meaning of love. The goddess of love agreed to reveal it to Tamorlyn, where he was to bring her three bounties. The elf spent centuries performing the deity's task. Then the quest was over, and Tamorlyn discovered that his family had all perished from a disease . The grieving man began crying, and his wailing became a song dedicated to love. Touched by the song, the goddess of love took the elf to Arvandor to join his wife and children in the afterlife. Later, Sharwyn decided to search for the actual transcript of Tamorlyn's song of love, and she may have had found it with the help of the Hero of Neverwinter.</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the Neverwinter-Luskan war, Sharwyn decided to stay in Neverwinter for a little while. She and her companions were hailed as heroes and sponsored by Lord Nasher Alagondar to aid with the rebuilding of the Neverwintran militia. However, the Hero of Neverwinter left the city after a disagreement with Nasher, and a man, whom Sharwyn met during the rebuilding and fell in love with, left the city soon after. Sharwyn's mother was cured from bonerot but nevertheless still perished with her daughter by her side from a heart condition soon after the end of the Neverwinter-Luskan war. Sharwyn could not stay, feeling lonely, and eventually traveled to the city of Waterdeep when the City of Splendors became threatened by the drow from the Undermountain . The Masked Lords , rulers of Waterdeep, determined that the danger was indeed coming from Undermountain, and Durnan , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal , put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the mega-dungeon and route the evil within. Sharwyn, as well as several other companions of the Hero of Neverwinter, Daelan Red Tiger , Linu La'neral , and Tomi Undergallows , answered the call. She was part of a battle that emerged at the Yawning Portal when drow assassins poured out of the dungeon. Surviving the battle, Sharwyn and other adventurers rushed into Undermountain after the attackers, where she was slain by a poisoned arrow .</p>
<p>A brave adventurer, the famed Drogan Droganson's pupil, followed them, armed with a rod of resurrection in case they came across any of the adventurers' bodies. Sharwyn had been returned to life by the adventurer, joining them on another larger-than-live adventure to the bottom the the mega-dungeon and across the planes.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , fate brought Sharwyn back together with the Hero of Neverwinter. Surviving much in such a short time, Sharwyn found herself questioning life and fate, scared of death, feeling unsafe wherever she went. She traveled to Icewind Dale to escape the strife of Neverwinter, the traumatic memories of Waterdeep, to find anonymity and write a masterpiece ballad – the Ballad of Icewind Dale . She heard rumors of the Hero of Neverwinter being spotted in Targos , one of the Ten Towns . Initially, Sharwyn dismissed them as poppycock but when she came face-to-face with Aarin Gend , who worked with the Hero back in Neverwinter. Soon after, they reunited and Sharwyn embarked on another journey with the Hero, defending the Ten Towns from the catastrophic awakening of the godling called Arctus and to uncover the cause of the Hero's mysterious amnesia. When the evil god was defeated in a great Battle of Targos, – Sharwyn parted ways with the Hero, at last recovering her lost confidence.</p>
