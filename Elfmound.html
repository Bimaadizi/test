<p>The Elfmound was a mysterious hill and ruin lying in the Hullack Forest in the East Reaches of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A hill with a peculiarly flattened top, it has unidentified structures buried within.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although it was dubbed 'Elfmound', excavations conducted in the late 1400s DR revealed no connection to elves . Instead, it appeared to be constructed by ancient Netherese , possibly a remote watchtower or safehouse for concealing a treasure or hazard. However, when the explorers unearthed a strange shaft inscribed with runes, they were all stricken with 'a death curse' at the very same time. The excavation was abandoned, but as of 1479 DR there had been reports of crying and even disturbing screams echoing upon from the old shaft.</p>
