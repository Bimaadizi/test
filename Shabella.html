<p>Shabella the Pale was the high priestess of the Temple of Mask in Bezantur , Thay , as well as the Guildmistress of that city's thieves' guild in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shabella was greedy, and tyrannical in her control over the guild and the city of Bezantur.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under her leadership, the thieves' guild operating out of the Temple of Mask was one of the most powerful institutions in Bezantur, with leverage over the merchants and the guards. She took a personal cut of all temple donations and all guild activities.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She always made sure to keep Tharchion Aznar Thrul well bribed, and always sent him a nice fruit basket each year on the day of Bezantur's founding.</p>
<p>While she was the high priestess of the Temple of Mask, she was not the most high-ranking member of the church of Mask in Thay. Whenever her superior, a traveling high priest, was in town, she was subordinate to him with regards to issues of the faith.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As the head of Bezantur's mighty thieves' guild, Shabella was one of the most powerful people in the city by the late 1360s DR, with even Aznar Thrul effectively in her pocket. However, as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Shadowmaster of Telflamm had begun operating in the city, and were undermining her and her guild's influence.</p>
