<p>Rhazzt's Dilemma was a cavern in the Northdark that served as an outpost for the drow city of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Rhazzt's Dilemma was located between Gracklstugh and Menzoberranzan, about 30 miles south of the drow city. It was also 25 miles south of the Pillars of Woe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , the outpost was manned by about 80 warriors (somewhat fewer than normal), mostly from House Agrach Dyrr , and commanded by Mistress Nafyrra Dyrr . The invading duergar army from Gracklstugh passed through the area on their march to Menzoberranzan. Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin , posing as Captain Zhayemd of Agrach Dyrr, reported to the drow's city leaders that the outpost had been destroyed by duergar (though in fact that was not entirely true because House Agrach Dyrr was aligned with Nimor and the duergar). His reports led to the formation of Army of the Black Spider to combat the approaching duergar..</p>
