<p>The Council of Farmer-Grocers was the guild of farmers, millers, and foodstuff merchants who conducted their business within the city of Waterdeep . It operated in a similar manner to many merchant consortiums, wherein members looked out for one other's interests along with those of the city overall.</p>
<h2>Uniform</h2>
<p>Guild members wore cloaks or sashes of a vibrant green hue. During early summertime, they wore floral blossoms upon their left shoulder.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The council determined the prices for raw grains ever year, controlling both the mills and their operation. They ensured that the city's granaries and icehouses were full, with enough provisions to feed everyone in both Castle Waterdeep and the city palace , along with keeping emergency reserves in case of war, famine, or other disaster that may ruin the city's crops.</p>
<p>In addition, they arranged for the removal of spoiled food, which was carted out to refuse dumps south of the city walls.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, the four Waterdhavian noble families that sponsored the expedition to establish New Waterdeep in Maztica had all negotiated individual exclusive trade agreements with the Council of Farmer-Grocers. These families were the Adarbrents , the Helmfasts , the Jardeths , and the Raventrees .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Membership within the council changed every year, depending on the most recent harvest. Most members were enrolled for a single year, with an expiration date in the month of Hammer . There were however a score of lifelong members whose vast farmlands and holdings set them apart as among the wealthiest Waterdhavian farmers.</p>
<p>No one was turned away from being a member of the guild. The entrance fee was 1 gp a year or 25 gp for the select lifetime members; monthly dues were 5 sp a month.</p>
<p>The guild ensured that their guild members had space for their stalls in the market, although they were responsible for their daily fees.</p>
