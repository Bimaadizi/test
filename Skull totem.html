<p>The skull totem was a mace crafted from the skull of a dead oni known as the Ogre King . It was considered to be of great religious significance to the goblins who worshiped the Ogre King as a demigod from within the Barrow of the Ogre King in the Delimbiyr Vale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The head of the mace was fashioned from the large humanoid skull of the Ogre King, although one of the two horns had been broken off at the base. The skull was covered in elaborate, blood-red tracings. It was set into a long, leather -wrapped haft that allowed it to be held and wielded as a mace.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The mace was a goblin totem , meaning that merely holding it imbued the wielder with a confidence to face enemies much larger than they were. The weapon itself was also just a bit more dangerous when it struck bigger enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The skull totem was fashioned by goblin worshipers of the Ogre King sometime after his death in the early 15 th century DR , alongside a dagger made of the missing horn, known appropriately as the horn totem . When the goblins' High Shaman , Sancossug , began plotting to revive the Ogre King in the late 1470s DR, both totems became vital as he wanted the Ogre King's skeleton to be intact for his ritual.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the horn totem was stolen from the Barrow of the Ogre King by a wizard from Loudwater known as Curuvar the Brazen , prompting a violent retaliation by the goblins. Adding insult to injury, Curuvar then sought out adventurers to retrieve the skull totem from its resting place inside the Ogre King's sarcophagus deep within the Barrow.</p>
