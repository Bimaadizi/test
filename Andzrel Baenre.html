<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Andzrel wore black mithral plate and a dark cloak. He was tall and disciplined. He wielded a two-bladed sword .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Andzrel was once polymorphed into a riding lizard by Nauzhror Baenre and promptly bit him in the buttocks. Since then their relationship was somewhat strained.</p>
<h3>War of the Spider Queen</h3>
<p>When Triel Baenre ordered the formation of the Army of the Black Spider in 1372 DR , she placed Andzrel as its commander. Although Andzrel was very capable, Nimor Imphraezl (disguised as Captain Zhayemd of House Agrach Dyrr ) was able to charm Andzrel into taking his misleading advice.</p>
<p>Forming a decisive plan against the armies of Gracklstugh , Andzrel led the drow to the defense of the Pillars of Woe , where the army was betrayed by the plans of Nimor. He tasted his first defeat there both as a commander and as a warrior when he faced Nimor Imphraezl in personal combat (although Nimor was defeated with magical aid, but was nonetheless able to escape via his ring of shadow ).</p>
<p>Sometime later, Gromph Baenre and Andzrel disguised themselves as tanarukks and entered the enemy camp. Gromph attached a light gem to Nimor to prevent him shadow-walking. However, in the process, Gromph himself was blinded.</p>
<h3>Post- Spellplague</h3>
<p>In 1463 DR , Andzrel was still serving as House Baenre's weapons master, with Tiago Baenre serving as his first assistant until he left for Gauntlgrym .</p>
