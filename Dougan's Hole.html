<p>Dougan's Hole was the smallest of the Ten Towns in Icewind Dale . It comprised a meager grouping of buildings arranged around a pair of piers, one long and one short.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located on the western shore of Redwaters , southwest of Good Mead . Its northern edge was marked with a path of gravel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hamlet of Dougan's Hole was founded by Dougan Dubrace , when he found a great spot to fish on the shore of Redwaters lake.</p>
<p>During the 1360s DR, the spokesman was Freya Grynstead , the widow of the previous spokesman who had died while fishing out on the lake. Freya lived in a house in the middle of town connected to the fishhouse by a boardwalk.</p>
<p>Some one hundred years later, around the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the speaker was the outspoken and gruff trapper Edgra Durmoot .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Perhaps the only noteworthy landmark of Dougan's Hole was the megalith structure known as the Twenty Stones of Thruun . These twenty granite slabs, arranged in an equilateral triangle that overlooked the town.</p>
