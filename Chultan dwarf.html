<p>Chultan dwarves , or dwarves of the Domain as they called themselves, were albino dwarves that once lived in vast mines and other communities, deep beneath the land of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chultan dwarves lived underground for generations and had developed albino skin, white hair, and pink eyes. This meant that they were very sensitive to the bright, hot sun of Chult and therefore only came aboveground at night. This was in contrast to the other major population of dwarves in Chult, the wild dwarves , who dwelt on the surface.</p>
<p>Aside from their albino appearance, Chultan dwarves were otherwise physically similar to their northern cousins, albeit a bit shorter on average.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chultan dwarves were even more somber and grumpy on average than the dwarves of the northern realms. They were not especially violent, but they would defend their homes and mines at any cost.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Most Chultan dwarves lived deep below the surface of Chult, centered in a community known as the Domain . Their subterranean realm comprised many mines that were full of gems, minerals, and ore. They dug out a vast network of tunnels and passageways through the dense jungles of Chult, for use to escape its many deadly predators.</p>
<p>These dwarves made use of the dinosaurs of the surface as pack animals in their mining operations. Their culture revolved around the wealth of their subterranean mines, and they were superb craftsmen, particularly when working with gems and precious metals.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Chultan dwarves put more importance into heritage and status of one's birth, rather than their capabilities as a leader or member of their society.</p>
<p>They also maintained their own written language, distinct from that of dwarves to the north.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>Tabaxi superstitions equated the color white with death, so Chultan dwarves were often feared by the Chultan humans .</p>
<p>Their usual trade partners were the Batiri goblins from the Dimetrodon Clan . The dwarves received food, skins, and ivory from the goblins in exchange for gems.</p>
<p>The Chultan dwarves also sold diamond -edged weapons to surface folk, including axes , short swords , and spears .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout much of their history, the dwarves of Chult suffered terribly at the hands of the jungle-dwelling yuan-ti .</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , hundreds of the Chultan dwarves of the Kobold Mountains were forced to leave their subterranean realms as they collapsed due to volcanic activity. Many dwarves were killed by the predators of the jungle, and while some sought refuge in Port Nyanzaru , others adapted to life in the jungle. Without the traditional means and raw materials to continue their smithing crafts, they resorted to making armor, weapons, and tools out of dinosaur hide and bones, as well as flint and wood. They also continued to craft jewelry using bones, feathers, tusks and stones instead.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, some dwarves still aspired to reclaim their abandoned homes, such as the firenewt -infested forges of Hrakhamar . By this time, a few of the jungle-dwelling Chultan dwarves became so attuned to their new home that they attracted the attention of powerful nature spirits , who granted them boons and spells . These dwarven protectors of the jungle came to be called "spirit warriors".</p>
