<p>Fisher's Wharf was a pier used by fishing vessels and an occasional live-in boat tied to the docks, located in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Fisher's Wharf stood on the coastal border of the Eastway section of the Lower City in Baldur's Gate. Sailor's Crossing was located just a street away to the south, and Jopalin's tea and kaeth cafe was built on the outer side of the block that faced Fisher's Wharf.</p>
<p>First thing in the morning, all fishing vessels departed the pier, leaving behind docked houseboats of those who lived on the water.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , on Kythorn 19 , the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. The nearby Fisher's Wharf had one witness â€“ the aging alchemist named Drusilla . She lives in a distinctly decorated docked boat. The investigator named Tav was familiar with the alchemist and discussed what she heard during the murder over a cup of tea.</p>
