<p>The scrying glass was enchanted hand mirror that allowed its users to discern the true nature of magic items .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The name of the scrying glass was a misnomer. This magic hand mirror did not allow the owner to use scrying magic, nor could it be used to communicate across distance. Instead, the scrying glass could be held in hand and used to identify magic items reflected in it. Its magic had limited use but it could detect cursed items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The scrying glass dated back to the era of the ancient Myth Drannor , the City of Song. In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the scrying glass could be found in the city's ruined Mages' Guild , which was infested with ravenous ogre slugs .</p>
<p>Another scrying glass was known to exist sometime in the 14 th century DR , being hidden within a mysterious dungeon that became the target of a powerful unnamed sorceress who sought to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
