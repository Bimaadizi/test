<p>Halruaan consumption was a deadly, magical form of consumption that could be contracted by creatures who ventured into the plaguelands of Halruaa in the years between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering , when the old Halruaa returned and most of the effects of the Spellplague ended.</p>
<h2>Acquisition</h2>
<p>Merely venturing into the active Spellplague of Halruaa's valleys subjected visitors to Halruaan consumption, however the disease did not affect creatures that were already plaguechanged or spellscarred .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Halruaan consumption was a easting disease: those suffering from it experienced vomiting and sudden weight loss. In the initial stages of the disease, sufferers' natural rest and recovery processes were interrupted, and their willpower and fortitude were weakened. The disease also had peculiar consequences for magic: any healing spells cast on the afflicted creature would be less effective, while arcane attack spells cast by the creature would be more powerful. If a victim didn't recover and the disease progressed, they would suffer damage to their body as they wasted away. In the terminal stage, the afflicted disintegrated into luminous blue dust.</p>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>Some victims recovered spontaneously in the early stages of the disease, and acquired a spellscar as a reminder of their illness.</p>
<p>The damage inflicted on a sufferer's body could not be healed unless the disease was cured or recovered from.</p>
