<h2>History</h2>
<p>Clan Verthisathurgiesh was one of the oldest Thymari clans, dating back to the foundation of Tymanchebar , and was one the most important and influential clans after the foundation of Tymanther. Clan Verthisathurgiesh was the clan in charge of safekeeping the powerful artifact known as the Eye of Blazing Rorn .</p>
<p>Clans Verthisathurgiesh and Shestandeliath were traditional allies since the foundation of Tymanchebar.</p>
<p>The clan's reputation was greatly damaged in 1486 DR , thanks to the despotic rule of the former patriarch, Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed , who exiled just about everyone who annoyed him.</p>
<p>To save her clan's reputation, Verthisathurgiesh Anala , the matriarch in 1486 DR, asked Vanquisher Tarhun for permission to recall all the exiled members and offered to reinstate them into the clan. She also arranged marriages of the young members of the clan with promising members of the other well-off Thymari clans, to ensure strong alliances in the future.</p>
