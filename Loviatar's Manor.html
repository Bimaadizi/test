<p>Loviatar's Manor , known to its congregation as The Manor , was a temple dedicated to Loviatar in Bezantur , Thay . It was believed to be the largest Loviatan temple in all of Faer√ªn as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." It was adjacent to several other temples, including the Temple of Sharess to the north, the House of Cyric and House of Iyachtu Xvim to the east, and the Temple of Oghma to the south.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was one of the largest in Bezantur. It was built into a hillside and was surrounded by extensive and fastidiously maintained gardens lined with graveled paths and dotted with fountains.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Manor's many rooms were haphazardly laid out. These included common rooms for group "worship" activities dedicated to the goddess of pain, as well as private rooms for more intimate "worship". It had an indoor swimming pool.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Manor was popular not only with Loviatar's faithful, but with those who paid her little heed but nevertheless lusted for the many services available within the Manor's walls. This second group included Red Wizards and even clerics of other faiths.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Time of Troubles , Thayans only worshiped Loviatar as a handmaiden of Bane or Bhaal , and was thus venerated within their temples. The Manor was the only temple in all of Thay that was dedicated solely to her worship.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the Manor was one of the more notable temples in Bezantur. Her worshipers were influential in the city's "red lantern district" of the Street of White Roses as well as with the city's premier tattoist . As of this time, the Manor was at risk of losing some of its pleasure-seeking congregation to the Temple of Sharess , which offered far less painful delights.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the late 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was Mylra , who was active in all forms of worship practiced in the Manor.</p>
