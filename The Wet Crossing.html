<p>The Wet Crossing was a tavern in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was the only tavern in the settlement at the time.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood north of Bargewright Inn, between a rental paddock and the stables.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building's fa√ßade displayed an ugly leaping-fish figurehead and prow, which came from the original owner's old boat.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Wet Crossing was a place of loud and lively song and dance, which the original owner had been famous for. There was much shouting and stomping and friendships being forged. However, as it was often deafeningly loud, seriously conversation and trade had to be conducted outside. Nevertheless, a good deal of business in the North was done in this friendly, noisy atmosphere.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The drinks were cheap at 1 cp for a tankard of beer and 2 cp for a tallglass of wine , with quality to match: Volo described the dry white wine as "rough but good" and the red as "reeking" and "truly horrible".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, a ferryman plied the Ironford crossing over the River Dessarin in a leaky old boat, but after the building of the new Ironford bridge, he had no longer had any trade. So he dragged his old boat onto the shore and established the Wet Crossing tavern instead.</p>
<p>He died shortly thereafter, but his friends continued to manage the tavern on behalf of his widow, as they did through the mid-1360s DR.</p>
