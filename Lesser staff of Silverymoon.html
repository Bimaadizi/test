<p>A lesser staff of Silverymoon was a type of magical staff that was often given to trusted agents of Alustriel Silverhand , High Lady of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lesser staffs of Silverymoon were made primarily of a deep weirwood , itself engraved with inlays of silver , and each had a moonstone at its peak that would glow softly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A lesser staff of Silverymoon contained a variety of magical spells that its user could cast, bestowing upon them an arcane sight or allowing them to fly , as well as protecting themselves through the use of a minor globe of invulnerability . They could restrain their enemies through the use of forcecage or hold monster , or even create a wall of force . In a more offensive capacity, a lesser staff of Silverymoon could also cast a chain lightning spell. The staff also allowed them to animate objects , or make use of a dimension door or passwall passage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The lesser staffs of Silverymoon were created by the city's High Lady, Alustriel, at some point prior to 882 DR . Although there were less than twelve of them, a certain number were in Eaerlann when it was plundered by the demons that poured out of Hellgate Keep in that year, and, around 500 years later, as of 1374 DR , at least one of these staffs remained in Hellgate Keep 's ruins.</p>
<p>The majority were kept in Alustriel's personal vaults or were wielded by other wizards whom she entrusted them to. Even upon relinquishing her rulership over the city of Silverymoon, she would occasionally bestow one of the lesser staffs of Silverymoon to those who had proven themselves to be good and worthy, and who wished to help the blossoming state of Luruar .</p>
