<p>The Shutters was a neighborhood mostly comprised of private and secure warehouses in the Crow's End District of Ravens Bluff , located across the Fire River from Shadystreets .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Shutters was a relatively small neighborhood of about eleven uneven city blocks with a single bridge across the Fire River connecting it to Shadystreets. The Ravensbridge laid on the northeastern end of the neighborhood on Stonekeep Concourse . Two streets that ran from east to west formed the neighborhood's southerns border: Hammerstone Street to the east and Red Sails Way to the west. Karen Court ran parallel these two streets, while Mraedara's Street , Stonekeep Concourse, Burning Shield Lane , Landleen Lane , Helhavryn's Walk , Castles Way , and Deepaxe Way connected them, crossed, and moved further south, beyond the neighborhood's border.</p>
<p>The neighborhood was sparsely populated with most inhabitants being mercenary garrisons who ensured the tightly-shuttered warehouses of the Shutters remained unburglarized. The neighborhood's shores were muddy, allowing the locals fish for river eels as well as other edible sea creatures. Abundant seagulls were often knocked out with stones and sent straight to the locals' stewpots . Most animals found here were just food, apart from ravens , who remained unharmed. These reasons were why The Shutters were mostly ignored by tourists and visitors.</p>
