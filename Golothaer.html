<p>Golothaer was a city of the drow in the Great Bhaerynden more than 5000 years ago. [ as of when? ]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was part of the first drow realm in the Underdark but like most of them had two main fractions. One were the worshipers of Ghaunadaur and the other of Lolth . Both began a bloody civil war against each other, which ultimatly destroyed Golothaer. Before the city was completly destroyed some clans started a long journey through the Underdark, following the priestess of Lolth Menzoberra the Kinless . They founded the city of Menzoberranzan in the northern Underdark. After the new city was established the last refugees left Golothaer and headed for Menzoberranzan .</p>
