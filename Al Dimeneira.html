<p>Al Dimeneira was a powerful angel (a movanic deva or a solar ) of the Upper Planes who once tried to defeat the power of Crenshinibon , but without success.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He resembled a handsome elf with wings, golden skin and long blond hair, naked but for a well-placed sash .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one time, in some place, Al Dimeneira tried to put an end to the evil artifact called Crenshinibon . The demon Errtu was looking for the relic, craving its power, but Al Dimeneira appeared and banished Errtu back to the Abyss with a single word and then went after the relic. Telshazz , Errtu's demon minion, tried to stop him and failed. However, Crenshinibon 's power overwhelmed the angelic being, burning his hands as he tried to grasp it and showing he could not destroy the evil Crystal Shard. Instead, Al Dimeneira threw the relic across the planes of existence, hoping to put it far away from Errtu's grasp, hoping it would be found by no-one except someone with the power and sense to destroy it.</p>
