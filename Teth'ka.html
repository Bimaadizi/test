<p>Teth'ka was a githyanki warrior in training from Crèche Y'llek , on Toril during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Teth'ka had a gaunt gith body and long light brown hair. She wore a set of githyanki-crafted half plate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Teth'ka's people, the gith group that would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands of West Faerûn sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Teth'ka, loyal to her Kith'tak, was a warrior in training who was to become a sarth, leading her kin into battle. She and several of her kin ventured into the nearby shadow-cursed lands , where they encountered a corrupted spirit of nature Thaniel who forced them to play games with him and his shadows and ended up killing Teth'ka and others.</p>
