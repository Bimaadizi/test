<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Mirtul 6 of 1357 DR , Burlane was already a part of the Company of the Bright Spear. On that month, they stopped at The Rising Moon in Highmoon . While they celebrated their exploits at the inn, the company's thief, Lynxal , was slaid by a local veteran after trying to pickpocket him. When returning to their room later, Ferostil discovered his shield missing; the maid at the inn, Shandril Shessair, announced she had stolen them. Predictably, they hired her as the new thief.</p>
<p>During the next day, while the company decided whether to wait out the afternoon's mist or proceed in it, Ferostil's vote was for proceeding; when they made camp afterwards, he was assigned second watch. Ferostil fought in the battle that came on Mirtul 12 , as they came in conflict with a mule train. He voted for pursuing the mule train afterwards. They pursued it to the Gates of Doom in the Oversember Vale in Mirtul 20 , where he was slain by a lightning spell, almost certainly lightning bolt , cast by a magic-using sentry.</p>
<p>The dwarven adventurer Delg confirmed his death two months later.</p>
