<p>The Starn was a valley somewhere in Faerûn . It was rural land by the 8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The valley was crossed by the Larrauden river, and the Gar's Road entered it from the east. Opposite from the entrance lay a keep, the Shrine of the Sheaf . A town, Buckralam's Starn , lay between them, and there were a number of farms surrounding.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The valley was briefly dominated by the Iron Fox in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the bard Talost visited the Starn Valley, and described Buckralam's Starn, perhaps not very kindly. Around 753 DR , a local band of adventurers, Taver's Talons , were slain in battle with a dragon .</p>
<p>In Year of the Enigma, 755 DR , the local town of Buckralam's Starn came under the control of a bandit known as the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his fortress, renaming it Fox Tower. He was later defeated and removed by Elminster Aumar , a wandering Chosen of Mystra , with the help of a local woman, Immeira .</p>
