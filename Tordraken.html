<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Duke Llachior Blackthorn purchased the ruined ducal castle circa the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , it was the seat of power of the Duchy of Draknor. With the events that took place in the Ten Black Days of Eleint , Tordraken was ruined and Draknor was no more. Duke Blackthorn renovated the keep and used it as his second home, away from Velen.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Tordraken had regained its status as the ducal castle and the seat of power in Cape Velen. The keep hosted a grand masquerade gala annually a tenday after Harvestcourt .</p>
