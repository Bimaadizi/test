<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hideo's kama were created by Hideo to arm peasants for the defense of their home – Kyo Prefecture. The simple folk were harassed by a band of marauding pirates, and with the help of these magic implements, they survived the battle. Soon after, Hideo himself fell out of favor with the locals and perished in poverty as he used up all of his money in the development and production of these kama.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , several of Hideo's kama found way west and ended up in the hands of merchants and adventurers of the Sword Coast and the city of Neverwinter . In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Okuzo's Imports store in Westgate 's Harbor Loop had Hideo's kama in stock, brought straight from Kara-Tur.</p>
