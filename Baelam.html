<p>Baelam the Bold was a wizard and thief in Myth Drannor in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While his humor was black and he was grim, he could comport himself gently and courteously when he really wanted to.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He had broad shoulders, standing about 6‑foot‑1‑inch (1.9‑meter) tall, with jet black hair and a hooked nose.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Baelam had a metal left hand, capable of dealing serious damage, even to creatures that required as much magic as a stone golem to be struck down. The hand was part of his body and couldn't be removed; if it were to be separated from him, it would continue to act on his will, even if the rest of him was disintegrated . The excruciating experience of grafting had made him just about immune to nausea and pain. Besides his prowess as a mage and a sneak, Baelam's agility and wit were absolutely superlative.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Besides a spellbook, he carried a ring of the ram , a vampiric ring of regeneration , a powerfully enchanted dagger that could blink on command for some minutes about once every 33.3 hours, a rope of entanglement , and a potion of healing he carried in a steel vial. He also carried some money, and more often than not, a few gems.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baelam was an infamous and very successful thief in the Sword Coast until he tried to steal from the wizard Thronthimm Blacksilver . Trying to disable a trap, Baelam lost his left hand. He managed to steal a strange iron golem and fled. However, later the golem animated and tried to kill him but Baelam, using a powerful magic item , destroyed the golem's head.</p>
<p>Afterward, he took the still-working left hand of the golem and went to the wizard Irritym Wonderstar in Waterdeep . Using most of Baelam's, treasure Irritym transplanted the golem hand to Baelam, replacing the lost one.</p>
<p>Impressed by Irritym's result, Baelam decided to train in magic under him. In the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , Irritym was killed by a group of thieves and Baelam managed to killed the assassins but couldn't resurrect the wizard.</p>
<p>He continued his training in magic, wandering the Sword Coast and killing infamous thieves and using their treasures to finance himself. During this time, Baelam made many enemies, among them the sorcerer Garthagul of Calimport and the infamous thief Ssilban the Silent of Theymarsh .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR , a large group of thieves attacked Baelam in Waterdeep with the objective of stealing Irritym's remaining magical treasures. Baelam managed to kill all them but destroyed Irritym's house in the process. He then went to Blackstaff Tower and gave Khelben Arunsun all of Irritym's remaining magical treasures, apologizing for the trouble he had caused to the city and then disappeared.</p>
<p>For a time he wandered around the Realms helping innocents and thieving from evil wizards and other thieves. Around 1356 DR he had settled in Myth Drannor , with the objective of finding and recovering some lost magic.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR there was a rumor around Greengrass that Garthagul unearthed a number of automatons branded with Wonderstar's symbol while excavating under a Dock Ward warehouse. As none were seen, it was largely considered to be a bid to bring out Baelam; the man was spotted at many taverns throughout Waterdeep within days, while Garthagul disappeared just as suddenly.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sometimes, Baelam helped adventurers against baatezu and alhoon . He preferred to trade magic rather than killing.</p>
