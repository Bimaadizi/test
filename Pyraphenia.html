<p>Pyraphenia the Firebrand was a mercenary and the main lieutenant of Gommoth the Twisted , the cult-leader that took control of Mount Hotenow for a time during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Unlike fervent members of Gommoth's Cult of Maegera , Pyraphenia was not invested nor did she believe in the goal to reawaken the sleeping fire primordial Maegera . Rather she was a pragmatist that saw the rise of the fire giant faction as a great opportunity to hone her skills as a swordswoman.</p>
<p>Much to her chagrin, Pyraphenia was relegated to guarding the red dragon Karrundax , and forced to remain within its lair in Mount Hotenow, rather than fight in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pyraphenia finally got her chance to test her combat prowess against worthy combatants in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , when the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge assaulted the cult's holdings in Mount Hotenow. Ultimately her abilities and expertise were not as good the warrior believed, and she fell to the group while defending the young Karrundax and her wyrmlings .</p>
