<p>Hasar Al-Yasan was a noble genie who protected the lost city of Suj around 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hasar was a muscular individual with desert-yellow skin. His hair was tied into a ponytail at the back of his head, leaving the rest of his scalp bald. He had yellow eyes and cultivated a thin mustache and soul patch. Hasar wore several pieces of jewelry, including bicep bracelets and earrings, and he also wore spiked bracers covering his wrists and lower arms.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Slightly more intelligent than the norm, Hasar preferred to attack from afar using magical whirlwinds. Only when opponents drew close would he step into the fray.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hasar pledged to defend the city of Suj against intruders, and he felt bound to that pledge even after the settlement fell to plague around the 1260s DR. A century later he still kept his vigil, keeping curious individuals like Abu bin Sujah from entering Suj.</p>
