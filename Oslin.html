<p>Oslin was a small trading village in Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It lay at the southeastern tip of the Akanamere , betwixt the Akanul farming land and the Hills of Maerth . From Oslin, trails led west to Villon , south to Saden , and northeast around the lake-shore to Maerduuth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Oslin had stood as early as the 4 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the 10 th century DR, the mighty archmage Ultham, son of Urrekanam , who kept a tower in the Hills of Maerth, had a great love of Oslin and enjoyed playing chess with the village elders for hours on end. However, some time during the reign of King Tchazzar ( 929 – 1018 DR ), Ultham appears to have anticipated Chessenta's swift collapse and incessant warring, and created the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre to defend Oslin before he journeyed into the planes . Meanwhile, the Chessmen were just used as simple chess pieces.</p>
<p>Then, several years later, the lord of Maerduuth (at the time a large city) desired to annex Oslin and sent an expeditionary force, thinking it defenseless, with the ordinary farmers, fishers, and traders there unable to muster a capable militia and or hire mercenaries. Yet the good people of Oslin used the Chessmen to transform themselves into a company of strong soldiers, supported by potent mages and priests, that routed the Maerduuth force. A second expeditionary force didn't come back at all. Thereafter, the lord of Maerduuth and the neighboring powers elected to just ignore Oslin altogether.</p>
<p>Curiously, several decades later, a well-defended caravan transporting a fortune in gems from Unthalass to Akanax disappeared between Oslin and Maerduuth. The lone survivor reported they'd been ambushed by a company of glittering, armored knights—most likely the Chessmen again—and investigators found Oslin emptied of half its population overnight. They, the gems, and the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre were not seen again.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Oslin was a subject of Akanax around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Once defended by the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre creating a magical militia of its people, Oslin thereafter needed to hire mercenary companies to protect the village. One such mercenary company, the Lords of the Inner Reach , were based in Oslin around 1357 DR. They were hired by local farmers to push rivals off their lands so they could claim them.</p>
