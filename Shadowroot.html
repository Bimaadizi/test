<p>Shadowroot sacs were small, faintly glowing, bulbous fungus growths found in the Shadow-cursed Lands surrounding Moonrise Towers in the Western Heartlands in the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Despite their overwhelmingly putrid stench, shadowroot sacs were harvested for their alchemical properties. The sacs and their secretions were refined into a vitriol that possessed a peculiar effect on those who smelled it. This vitriol had a smell of cloying sweetness but provoked bile rising in one's throat. The same smell seemingly sharpened the senses of those who smelled it.</p>
<p>Shadowroot vitriol could be combined with certain types of ashes to brew elixirs of viciousness .</p>
