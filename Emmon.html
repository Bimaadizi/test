<p>Emmon was Marrec 's adoptive stepbrother, and his closest friend growing up.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike his siblings, who cared more for commerce, Emmon loved the wild just like Marrec did. He joined Marrec often in their treks, though he didn't share his martial prowess.</p>
<p>One night while they were kids, Emmon and Marrec were caught by a downpour of cold rain while out trekking on a dare. They sought shelter on a cave, where they came across an aggressive bear ; Marrec managed to keep it at bay with a sharp stick, but not before Emmon was injured.</p>
<p>He took up a posting with the village militia together with Marrec, when the latter was sixteen years old. In spite of the extensive weapon drills, Emmon was still not a good swordsman. He took up arms in defense of the village when they were raided by the Durang ogres , and was slain in that confrontation. The sight of his dead body allowed Marrec to unlock his medusa petrifying gaze.</p>
