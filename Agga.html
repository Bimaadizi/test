<p>Agga was a kobold from the Dragon's Rest cloister in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Agga was a woman of few words and she had zero tolerance for nonsense.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Agga shared with three other kobolds a small monastic cell in the Dragon's Rest cloister cut into the cliff face. Each of the four slept on individual hammocks. Just like all the other kobolds, she worked at night because of their sunlight sensitivity.</p>
