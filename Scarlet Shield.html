<p>The Scarlet Shield was a roadhouse inn in the town of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . Its landlord was Hendris Teinel .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood in the southern half of the city and south of the market, in the town's Highbank area.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although small and of average quality, with deliberately rustic furnishings and apparently cleanliness and service to match, the Scarlet Shield could actually be relatively enjoyable. The staff, though rarely sighted and apparently lazy, were generous with food and bedding. The building was often filled with the smell of warm baking bread, thanks to the bakery out back. However, the food was fairly bland.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The Scarlet Shield was inexplicably popular with adventurers and the militia of Loudwater, though few of the elves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The inn was built by a retired warrior, and named for the rusting shield he'd carried into battle. This man was deceased by 1366 DR , by which time the inn was managed by his nephew, who still ran it through 1370 DR . His many tales of his uncle suggested he was one of the greatest warriors of the Realms, capable of many great and unlikely deeds.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR , Hendris promised free meals nightly at the Scarlet Shield to any adventurer who could bring him back a piece of the Fools Finger obelisk. Despite the quality of the Scarlet Shield's food, many adventurers took him up on this for the sake of a ready source of food, and almost as many made it back with one of the stones.</p>
