<p>Shoudul of the Skulls was a ranking member of the Batiri Shattered Spear tribe in Chult circa 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shoudul wore an impressive feathered headdress – a symbol of status among Batiri.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , the Shattered Spear tribe came across the shipwreck of the Vigilant , a vessel that belonged to Sa'Sani 's trade company. The Batiri attacked the survivors, including the infamous author Volothamp Geddarm . Some of the survivors were captured by Taelunangul's goblins, along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by Ghzermag , Clawkeeper Kzheemoc , and Shoudul of the Skulls. Volo tried to persuade the charming locals to let the survivors go, but he was not as proficient in the Goblin language as he claimed to be. After the deaths of several Batiri, Shoudul of the Skulls tried to communicate in broken Common that he didn't want to fight; instead, he just wanted a meal – a meal of adventurers' supple flesh. Subsequently, Shoudul of the Skulls was killed along with other bloodthirsty Batiri.</p>
