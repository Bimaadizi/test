<p>The Mantle of Hell's Furnace was a brightly colored enchanted cloak imbued with raw magics of the Elemental Plane of Fire .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Mantle was a bright red cloth woven out of the flaming beard hair of countless azers . Sages believed that when the Mantle of Hell's Furnace exhausted its magics, it would disappear from the Prime Material plane and be pulled back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
<p>The enchantments weaved into the fabric of the cloak were powerful and allowed the wearer to cast Aganazzar's scorcher , burning hands , and charm fire elemental kin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first known owner of this cloak was Ullabem , the High Priest of Kossuth . He harnessed the cloak's magic for fifteen years until his death at the hands of a cleric of Istishia . The priestess was repulsed by the Kossuthan magic and attempted to destroy the Mantle . Fortunately, Ullabem's efreeti allies slew the cleric before the cloak could be lost forever. The next owner of the Mantle of Hell's Furnace was one of the efreeti who lost it to a cunning rogue who summoned the efreeti from a magical block of sandalwood .</p>
<p>Some time later, by the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the Mantle of Hell's Furnace ended up in possession of Orrick the Gray , who researched magical mythals in his tower just on the edge of Kuldahar on the Spine of the World .</p>
