<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mehmet was an outspoken lecturer who condemned the actions of holy slayers . News of his preaching reached the ears of the Grandfather of the Everlasting , who decided to put an end to the heresy.</p>
<p>A holy slayer disguised himself as a student, enrolling at the university where Mehmet taught. One day, the holy slayer confronted Mehmet in his private office under the pretense of discussing an issue. The slayer drew a knife and threatened to end Mehmet's life. After a brief struggle, Mehmet pleaded for his life to be spared. The slayer, seeing an opportunity, decided to spare Mehmet's life. A deal was struck between the two where the holy slayer would pay Mehmet on a yearly basis if he started preaching the positive aspects of brave Hajama , and Mehmet's life would also be spared for every year so long as he never condemned the holy slayers again.</p>
