<p>Vampiric Duality was a book that detailed the nature of vampires . It was written by Telshum Ver Condle and published before in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Vampiric Duality was a book plagued by tonal inconsistency. One moment, the author discussed a vampire's two instincts – feeding and procreation, the next, claiming that vampires possessed a personality as faceted as a schizophrenic diamond , then yet again, contradicting itself, talking about them being ideal predators of ravenous hunger with only one thing on ther minds – blood. And yet, the book also claimed that everyone would find vampires' romantic, dark allure, and passion appealing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Vampiric Duality book belonged to Araj Oblodra and could be found in her alchemist's lab and potion shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate called the Crimson Draughts .</p>
