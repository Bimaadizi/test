<p>Aumvor's castle was the personal stronghold of the Netherese sorcerer -turned- lich , Aumvor the Undying . It was located in the middle of the Lonely Moor in northwest Faer√ªn , in a patch of land that seemingly devoid of all life.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Several types of living corpses walked the castle grounds, including zombified jackals .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The black basalt castle had five spires, which stuck out from the ground in the appearance of a hand reaching to the skies. The front gate of the castle was shaped into the muzzle and head of a hyena . Although the keep was built in the middle of moorlands, the rock from which its bricks were made was carved from a mountain some 10' (3 m) underneath the soil. This unique construction caused sand to constantly form around the entrance and castle grounds.</p>
<p>The front courtyard had a staircase that led into the main keep. The main dining hall featured massive stone pillars, carved into the shape of arched skeletons , reaching towards and supporting the vaulted ceiling. While crafted by a master mason, the overall decor was notably macabre.</p>
