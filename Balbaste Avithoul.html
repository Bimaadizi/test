<p>Balbaste Avithoul was the matron mother of House Avithoul during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar and the hunt for the Thread of the Weave in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Darkening , Balbaste allied with House Szind and Dun'Robar and contributed her house's forces to the attack on Eveningstar , with a special focus on capturing surfacers for slavery. When the counterattack came, it was through an unexpected source: her former slave Mirini Elemys . Mirini had earned the "affection" of her mistress, and was henceforth kept close to more easily play with. This gave Mirini a good look at the layout of House Avithoul and Balbaste's magical devices, allowing the elf to steal a wand of invisibility and use a portal to escape the city. When Mirini reached Eveningstar, she worked with the Wizard of War Aptem Mews to send a team of adventurers back to House Avithoul, where they caused a slave revolt, destroyed their treasures, and killed countless house members.</p>
