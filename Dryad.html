<p>Dryads ( pronounced : /ˈ d r aɪ æ d z / DRY-ædz ), also known as wood nymphs , were fey -maidens who acted as the protectors of forests and trees.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They appeared to be beautiful women with delicate features seemingly made of soft wood. Their hair seemed to be made of leaves and foliage that changed color with the seasons of the calendar .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All dryads were magically bound to a single tree. These trees served as the dryad's life force and home. They fought to the death to protect their bonded tree, as should the tree be cut or destroyed, the dryad died soon afterward. A dryad could not stray too far from her bonded tree without suffering the same fate. If a dryad left the vicinity of her tree for too long, she died.</p>
<p>Acorn of far travel : If a dryad spellcaster cast this spell on an acorn harvested from her bonded oak tree , she was considered to be in contact with her tree at all times, regardless of the actual distance between them. Thus she became able to travel great distances without growing sick.</p>
