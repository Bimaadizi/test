<p>The Poisoned Quill was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Poisoned Quill was a one-story shack in squalid condition.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , The Poisoned Quill specialized in creating high-quality counterfeit documents and writs, ranging from travel permits to official licenses. It's owner, "Blind" Issayk had an intricate web of contacts across the Realms, which kept him abreast of bureaucratic changes that may render his forgeries obsolete. As a result, his products were highly effective, provided they were used promptly.</p>
<p>Through a combination of bribes, blackmail, and other underhanded methods, Issayk has amassed wax pressings of crucial governmental seals from across Faerûn , including those of Calimport , Luskan , Waterdeep , Cormyr , and Sembia . This collection enabled him to replicate a wide variety of official documents with remarkable precision. His services, however, came at exorbitant prices: minor travel writs might cost several hundred gold pieces , while more elaborate items, such as an engraved invitation to a Calishite noble’s ball or a signed adventuring license for use in Cormyr, may cost 2,000 gold pieces or more.</p>
<p>By 1492 DR , the shop was owned by Tasselgryn Velldarn , an archmage who was a close friend of Halaster Blackcloak . Instead of creating forgeries for clients, she instead provided a physical means of a quick exit from Skullport via teleportation circle . She was capable of bypassing the teleportation restrictions of Undermountain due to a series of enchantments cat by Halaster.</p>
