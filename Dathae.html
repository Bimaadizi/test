<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Dathae was the wife of the ranger Rhighaermon O'Antlers . He was a nobleman of Waterdeep who'd renounced his title and was the bearer of Yornar's Trail Companion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dathae married Rhighaermon in the Year of the Shrike, 1196 DR . Notably, they hung the glowing, crescent-moon-shaped Companion over their bridal bed. Afterward, while on their honeymoon, Rhighaermon finally delivered the Companion to the priest Klavaeron of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest . During this journey, Dathae's double-life as a swanmay was revealed, and they stayed together all their life.</p>
<p>Many years later, in the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR , Rhighaermon's path crossed that of the Companion again, when a mind flayer unwittingly tried to trade it to him in a bazaar in Murghyr in Murgh√¥m . Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the Companion , then carried it to the closest temple of Mielikki , in Maerlar in Mulhorand , though he suffered mortal injuries from the mind flayer's doppelganger minions. Mielikki herself slew the doppelgangers and carried the dying Rhighaermon to her realm. It was left to Dathae to complete the Companion 's journey, carrying it from Maerlar to the next Mielikkian priest in the book's 'Rightful Cycle'.</p>
