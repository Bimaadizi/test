<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in the Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Drussuvissill fled to the nearby city of Baldur's Gate with her farm animals. However, all of hers and many other farmers' beasts were confiscated by the Flaming Fist mercenaries upon entry to fight famine in the city. Drussuvissill was infuriated by Lord Gortash's decree and raged over the confiscated animals not being fair. Despite being robbed of her livelihood, Drussuvissill was granted entrance to the Lower City of Baldur's Gate, where she was protesting among other farmers near the Basilisk Gate .</p>
