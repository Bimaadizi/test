<p>Tymora's Fancy was a high coin gambling establishment in the North Ward of the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The gambling den offered a fair and level field of play: no spells , no magic items, no exceptions. Should any magic be used to effect a game, no winners would be declared as it was magic tainted.</p>
<h3>Games</h3>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The public was told that all clandestine magical items were disintegrated , though this was a lie as all such items were teleported to a locked box in the back office.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Its proprietor was Elaith Craulnober . He employed his oldest friend and distant kin, Tincheron , as one of the guards. The hall also employed several clerics , wizards , and even an illithid to watch for cheaters. At least one of the clerics was a worshiper of Gond , who ensured the clockworks of the games were working properly and to make repairs as needed.</p>
