<p>Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms was a book in the series of guides penned by the famous writer Volothamp Geddarm sometime after 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The guide contained information on the locations within the city of Samargol , curious and strange sites in the jungles of Samarach , several smaller surroundings cities, recount of his business with the merchant Sa'Sani , heroic deeds of the survivors of the Vigilant , and, presumably, several other locales of the "Serpent Kingdoms." According to the eyewitness accounts, Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms was filled with exaggerations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Volo's fateful trip to Samarach took place in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . During the disastrous sailing from the Sword Coast to the Snout of Omgar and his dealing with the merchants of Samargol, Volo enlisted the help of his fellow shipwreck survivors. The Adventurers collected lore, history, and information on the region for the book. Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms was finished and published after Volothamp's return to the Crossroad Keep on the Sword Coast.</p>
