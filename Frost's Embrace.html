<p>Frost's Embrace was a pair of boots of the north that were granted to a mortal man by the goddess Auril .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When worn, these boots protected an individual from the harmful effects of extreme cold, whether it was natural or magical in nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origin of Frost's Embrace date back to an incident where a lone adventurer, Daviol the Frozen , was left stranded by his fellow adventuring company when they were crossing the Great Glacier . The group had absconded with a large sack of gold and left Daviol to freeze in the blistering cold. With his dying breath, he cursed his former friends—words that caught the ear of Auril, the Frostmaiden.</p>
<p>Pleased by the man's rage and fear of death at the cold's embrace, she granted upon him these magical boots, which preserved his body during his trek back to the nearest settlement. Upon his arrival, Daviol found his former companions warm and cozy in the town's tavern. He took his revenge and murdered them in cold blood. After he was satiated, he continued his travels to the "frozen land" and was never heard from again.</p>
<p>Some time later, the boots came into the possession of a young man Jared, who carried them in his travels throughout the Sword Coast .</p>
