<p>Dorlan Nyrotha was Thoster 's first mate aboard the Green Siren during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a hulking man. He was often barefoot.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He thought the crew was not very tough, and would not disguise his scorn for fools.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Those who defied him were sometimes keelhauled.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His captain, Thoster, considered him someone to whom Japheth could direct talk of ghosts. The captain considered throwing him overboard once, too.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1396 DR , he was the first mate aboard Thoster's ship. While the ship was on a mission for Behroun Marhana , Dorlan discovered a chest aboard that roused his curiosity. The chest actually contained the sleeping form of Anusha Marhana , a stowaway and the sister of Behroun. She employed her insubstantial roaming dreamform to distract him the first time he investigated her chest, but when he came the second time, she attempted to touch him with her dreamform; the act put him out of commission.</p>
<p>When he woke up, they were under attack near the hidden island of Hegruth by the forces of the kraken Gethshemeth . The forces of the kraken struck at them as they met with Nogah , a rebel kuo-toa whip who was the kraken's enemy. The pirate rallied the crew during the battle, personally slaying at least one enemy kuo-toa.</p>
<p>Some time later, while accompanying Nogah in her attempt to wrest the Dreamheart back from the kraken Gethshemeth, Nyrotha was slain by an ooze.</p>
