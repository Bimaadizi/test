<p>Kyriel Alathar Pellinore was a human paladin , member of The Gauntlet vigilante group, and former member of the Council of Elders of Everlund .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Although a paladin, Kyriel was driven by incredible hatred for slavers and others who imprisoned innocent people. This hatred only became greater once his own family was abducted, and he never recovered until he lost the ability to laugh or even smile. He became completely dedicated to the extermination of all slave trade within Realmspace .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore an enchanted plate mail of continual cleanliness , and a ring of spell turning , wielding a sword of enemy detection and an enchanted shield . He also owned the spelljammer ship Gauntlet .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He led a raid on a neogi slave trading operation deep in the Tears , which saw nearly a hundred neogi and illithids dead and several humanoids freed from slavery.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Kyriel maintained a good working relationship with the other members of his organization, but while the rest bickered and bantered, he isolated himself, ever more bitter and gloomy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his younger years, he stood as one of the six elders on the council of Everlund, alongside being a member of the Lords' Alliance . He felt himself to be too young for an elder and thus never fully accepted the title. In the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR , an illithid slave ship raided Everlund and captured nearly 200 people, including Kyriel's wife and three children. Angered by the council's inability to do anything about this atrocity, he resigned from the council of elders and sought the arcane to purchase a ship that could pursue the illithids. During his search, Kyriel encountered those people whom he would form The Gauntlet . From then on, he spent his time with his group hunting slavers in the many asteroids of the Tears of Selûne .</p>
