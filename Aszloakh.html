<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aszloakh's moniker was given to him by inhabitants of the Gate because the saurial always wore a hooded weathercloak when outside on the city streets. He had a deep and rumbling voice and had many years of service to the Church of Finder Wyvernspur under his belt. Personality-wise, Aszloakh always remained patient and calm, even in the face of danger. The finhead saw humans from a friendly, humorous, yet cynical lens. He expected to be lied to and betrayed.</p>
