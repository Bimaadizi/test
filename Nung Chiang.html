<p>Nung Chiang ( pronounced : / n ʌ ŋ tʃ i ɑː ŋ / nung chee-ang ), called the Teacher of the Plow or the Master of the Red Earth , was one of the Nine Immortals who served the Celestial Emperor in the Celestial Empire , the dominant religion of Kara-Tur , particularly Shou Lung . He was a god of agriculture and fertility. As one of the Nine Immortals, Nung Chiang also held an important place in the Faith of the Nine Travelers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The immortal</h3>
<p>According to the legendary history of Kara-Tur , shortly after the beginning of the world and humankind , the Celestial Emperor sent his great emissaries among the people, with each to teach one aspect of the True Path of Enlightenment. Nung Chiang was one of these emissaries.</p>
<p>In the legend, nine tired travelers stopped at a poor remote inn in the dead of winter, and the innkeeper lamented he had no more food to spare. So, despite their tiredness, four went to hunt for game, four went to forage, and the last cooked a meal for the travelers, the innkeeper, and his family. Afterward, they preserved the remainder of the food to see the folk through the rest of winter. Overjoyed, the innkeeper made a gift, and a revelation—he was no mortal but the last of the old gods of the land, and he gave the land to the nine to rule. Afterward, these Nine Travelers became the Nine Great Sovereigns, and they ruled Shou Lung for thirty cycles of years. They became the first emperors of Shou Lung, and were recorded in legend as the "Nine Immortals".</p>
<p>Finally, the Nine Great Sovereigns, dressed as ordinary travelers, returned to the site of the inn, but found only a simple peasant's hut. The peasant, Nung Fu , welcomed them in and fed them freely, though it was the depths of winter and he had little to spare. Afterward, these Nine Travelers offered a gift in exchange for this hospitality, and presented Nung Fu with the Emblems of Authority . They took him to their courts, investing him as emperor of Shou Lung. This marked the start of the Third Age of Shou Lung , the beginning of the calendar in Shou Year 0 (−1250 DR) .</p>
<p>The Nine Great Sovereigns were then the Nine Travelers once more. The tales disagree as to what became of them after that. According to some, they simply faded away. To others, they went with the gods into the heavens. More told that the Nine Travelers still wandered Shou Lung to ensure that rulers respected the memory of Nung Fu, and that innkeepers took good care of their guests.</p>
<p>In −2113 DR , in order to protect the beautiful nature of the Shao Mountains , Nung Chiang threatened the construction of a highway and caused the volcano of Mount Tengkorak to erupt, destroying the city of Tempat Larang , a colony of Anok-Imaskar .</p>
<p>Afterward, he always watched over the ruined city, which was full of dark spirits. In 1358 DR , he noticed first Governor Kawabi and later General Goyat Nagumo trying to use the power of Tempat Larang's stone spirits . So Nung Chiang manipulated and helped an adventuring party to stop the menace. As a back-up plan, he was ready to activate Mount Tengkorak again, despite the fact his fellow Immortals would severely punish him for intervening in mortal business.</p>
