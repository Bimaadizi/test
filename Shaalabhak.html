<p>Shaalabhak was a illithid in the Plane of Shadow in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shaalabhak was a mind flayer that out of nowhere appeared in Vast Swamp offering its service to Despayr in his plot. Even since Shaalabhak served the Sharran dragon loyally but its motivation remained a mystery, sure it had no devotion to Shar or other gods. Its main interest seem to observe the creation of the tear in the Weave . In truth it regularly reported the progress to its fellows in Toril using it plane shift ability. Possibly it was defeated by an adventurers party.</p>
