<p>A rosecork was a type of tree found in Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Rosecork wood was durable and extremely resistant to fire. It absorbed such a great concentration of water that open flames could not ignite it, short of exposure to a very hot flame for some hours. For these properties, it was commonly used in construction.</p>
<p>The rosecork was native to the Isle of Prespur in the Sea of Fallen Stars , and was used to these warmer climes. However, Sarliman Eurdoe , an entrepreneur of Wheloon in Cormyr , imported the rosecork for its valuable properties and the trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the Wyvernflow . Bryn Ohme Thornwood mentioned the rosecork as an example of an introduced plant species that had no significant impact on the existing environment.</p>
