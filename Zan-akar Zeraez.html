<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , Zan-akar was the Akanûlan ambassador in Chessenta . He urged Shala Karanok to expel the Tymantherans from Chessenta, as Akanûl was an old enemy of the dragonborn nation. Although his initial efforts were fruitless when Shala Karanok discovered Akanûl had started diplomatic talks with High Imaskar , when a group of abishai disguised as dragonborn began to kill Chessentan citizens and allied themselves with enemies of Chessenta, Zan-akar was able to convince Shala Karanok to banish the Tymantheran ambassador from the country.</p>
