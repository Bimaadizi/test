<p>The Flotilla of DEATH was a trio of privateer vessels that operated in the Dragon Reach in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Outside of their human leader, the crew of the Flotilla of DEATH was entirely made up of tasloi from the island of Tasloiomitasloi . The majority of the crew spoke only the Tasloi language , were good swimmers, and wore itchy white sailor shirts. The lieutenants on the other hand had distinct dress and knew how to speak Common . Up to ninety tasloi were part of the crew at a given time, divided evenly between the three ships. Each tasloi was paid a few copper pieces for each job the flotilla went on, while the captain kept the majority of payment.</p>
<p>The captain generally got along well with his crew, though he was always looking to bolster it in some way, such as with downtrodden adventurers . The tasloi weren't enthused about working on the flotilla, but they enjoyed the chance to see the world and found it preferable to dealing with the predators back on their island. Additionally, they lacked the wit and spirit to incite a rebellion.</p>
<p>Besides sentient creatures, the crew of the Flotilla of DEATH was made up of giant gooney birds , a species of large bird endemic to Tasloiomitasloi that acted as aerial mounts . Up to sixty of them were part of the crew at a given time, divided evenly between the three ships, plus one particularly large gooney that stood on the captain's boat. This last bird was mostly for show, as it was too fat to take flight for long. Whenever the flotilla was docked at a port the gooneys would be tied to the boats on short leashes , allowing them to walk only a few feet across each deck, but while at sea they were on leashes that allowed them to fly up to a 100 ft (30 m) into the air.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Whenever the flotilla engaged ships or tried to raid seaports, the tasloi crew would take to the sky with their giant gooney mounts. Each tasloi fought with two to four rocks, six javelins , and a net .</p>
<p>The captain of the flotilla hoped to avoid actual combat whenever possible, largely depending upon the mere sight of his naval air squadrons and the fleet's name, Flotilla of DEATH , to instill enough intimidation into opponents as to make them surrender. This was because the giant gooneys were clumsy, irritable, dimwitted, and unreliable mounts that were liable to crash after being smacked around too much.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The captain accepted most employment offers that were given to the flotilla, though there was a preference for shorter jobs that minimized the degree of combat involved and maximized the potential for publicity. They usually charged a going rate of 50 gold pieces per day, though would charge clients more for dangerous missions.</p>
<p>A typical job for the flotilla could include acting as an escort, attacking a single ship, or guarding a waterborne parade.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The flotilla did not have a strict base of operations that it returned to after each job, but the island of Tasloiomitasloi largely filled the role. On the island was a small para-military academy that taught the native tasloi the art of seamanship. Whenever sever casualties were suffered by the flotilla, the island would be returned to in order to replenish crew numbers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The ships that made up the Flotilla of DEATH were all modified barges from Ravens Bluff . Each ship measured 80 feet (24 meters) in length, with the last 10 ft (3 m) of the decks sloping upwards. These acted as take-off ramps for the gooney birds.</p>
<p>Each ship's stern had 60 ft (18 m) masts with wide square sails. Each ship had a cabin measuring 7 ft (2.1 m) by 7 ft (2.1 m), where the captain and his lieutenants stayed, and a hold for the rest of the crew that measured 4 ft (1.2 m) tall.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , while sailing among the islands beyond Ravens Bluff, Spitvah Mc Gurk stumbled upon Tasloiomitasloi and its native inhabitants. He soon came upon an idea to take advantage of these natives, brokering communication with them and offering to take them out beyond their island home and its many predators. The tasloi were receptive to Mc Gurk's offer and over the next few months he established his academy on the island, training them how to be seamen. Following this education, Mc Gurk instructed the tasloi to capture a dozen giant gooneys and train them as mounts. Finally, Mc Gurk brought the trained crew of creatures together onto a trio of modified barges, officially forming the Flotilla of DEATH .</p>
<p>Around the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , the flotilla successfully chased a lost giant water beetle away from Ravens Bluff.</p>
