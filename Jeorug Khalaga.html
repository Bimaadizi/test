<p>Jeorug Khalaga was a human monk and the high lama of the city of Li-Raz on the Plain of Horses circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Khalaga was born to a family based in Li-Raz that had produced eighteen consecutive generations of first-born sons who took up the path of the lama . He grew up in the city and trained at the renowned Temple of Seven Bells .</p>
<p>However, the leaders of Li-Raz had grown less and less tolerant of the shiftless lamas so, around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Jeorug reinvented himself as a guide to get out of the city and reduce his profile. Fortunately, within a few months, Jeorug had become quite popular with travelers, thanks to his encyclopedic knowledge about the region and his good nature.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a bright, cheerful personality and was loquacious and a skilled debater. This was most evident in the choir horal , a kind of religious debate where lamas challenged each other with questions of a philosophical nature; Jeorug was talented in these.</p>
