<p>Terazul was a flowering plant found only in a few locations in the jungles south of Delzimmer . It was also the name of a somewhat addictive drug made from the leaves of the plant.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>When ground into a powder and snorted, the drug was a powerful stimulant, causing the user to remain awake for days at a time. When drunk as a potion it caused visions. Terazul was not without side effects, however, as children of terazul users were sometimes born with abnormalities such as tentacles.</p>
<p>The plant's properties were thought to be due to its ability to tap into lingering pockets of spellplague . In reality, the plant's roots grew out of portals to the Far Realm , which had been opened by derro in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The terazul trade was controlled by House Serrat of Delzimmer.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a group led by Alaia Serrat and her adopted daughter Zaltys closed the portal to the Far Realm, destroying the terazul plants.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , members of the Guild worked with smugglers who brought drugs, weapons , firewine , and other substances into Baldur's Gate . Pouches of 0.8 pounds (0.36 kilograms) terazul were among such illicit goods.</p>
