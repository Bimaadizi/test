<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1368 DR , Nexlit led his tribe to raid, kill, and capture cows from the local farmers. One such raid was led to the Lonely Peaks where Nexlit's xvarts attempted to massacre Hulrik 's bovine companion. Nexlit believed that his tribe was protected by Ursa the cave bear who resided nearby. He called the bear kind; however, Ursa felt no particular kinship with the diminutive humanoids and was likely to rend them as it was to rend any adventurers trying to stop xvart cattle raids.</p>
