<p>Zakee Rafeha was a bartender and portly gentleman who managed the Zephir tavern in Amkethran in Calimshan around 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zakee, whilst running the tavern, would often overhear stories told by the mercenaries of the monk, Balthazar . He would get scared by the awful tales they had to tell. He did not wish to know why these mercenaries were there, and was content just working in the tavern.</p>
<p>He may have informed Gorion's Ward that Marlowe was a stranger to Amkethran and arrived only a few weeks ago, but that he had to remain as his daughter fell ill.</p>
