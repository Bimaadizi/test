<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ottar was one of the many terrestrial sons of Annam All-Father and his wife Othea . His many siblings were his elder brothers Lanaxis , Vilmos , Nicias , and Masud , his younger brothers Obadai , Ruk , and Arno and Julian , and the youngest, known as Hartkiller . He had a half-brother through his mother named Dunmore , as well as three other half-brothers through his mother whose names are forgotten to history. Through his father, he was half-sibling to the giant gods Stronmaus , Hiatea , Grolantor , Iallanis , Memnor , and Skoraeus . He was likely related to the gods Surtr and Thrym as well.</p>
<p>Ottar was the father of Hrotun , the first skald of the frost giants, and Hjurgen , who went on to father the great hero Hjurnur Wyrmrever .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ottar was born sometime around −30,000 DR . When he and his terrestrial brothers came of age, Ottar's father, Annam, granted each of them an inheritance in the great giant empire of Ostoria. Ottar settled in the cold wilderness of the northern reaches of Ostoria, ruling as jarl, and his offspring became the frost giants.</p>
<p>After many millennia, it was revealed that Ottar's mother Othea had had an affair with the sea god Ulutiu and that his younger brother Dunmore was probably not a full brother. After Ulutiu's amulet caused the Great Glacier and the Endless Ice Sea to form, Ottar and his brothers soon discovered a way to halt the amulet's magic; however, they were forbidden from doing so by their mother. Lanaxis, Ottar's oldest brother and the leader of all of them, summoned them together for a meeting in Voninheim . There, Lanaxis planned to murder his mother by poisoning the waters of the Well of Health , but he accidentally poisoned not only Othea but also Ottar and all of his other brothers except Arno and Julian and Dunmore.</p>
<p>With all his poisoned brothers, Ottar was buried in a drumlin outside of Voninheim. There his body lay for about 3000 years until the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , when the firbolg Tavis Burdun unveiled the Twilight Vale and challenged Lanaxis. Lanaxis used powerful magic to reanimate Ottar's corpse as a zombie , and he did the same with all of the other brothers. The undead giant kings attacked Tavis with the full fury of their magics, but he and his companions were protected by Annam's axe Sky Cleaver . Tavis then used the magic of Sky Cleaver to reveal to them, even in their undeath, that Lanaxis, their older brother, had betrayed them. Ottar was the first of the giant brothers for whom the magic was effective, and he immediately turned and charged at Lanaxis instead. His undead brothers then followed him. Lanaxis created a magic shield to protect the portico from their onslaught. Nicias was able to shatter the shield with his morning star, but then Lanaxis killed each of them a second time with his sword.</p>
