<p>Carnelian , also known as sard , was a semi-precious stone found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carnelian was a variety of chalcedony that had a clear, orange to red to reddish-brown hue. It was typically cut cabochon and polished to a glossy finish, but could also be tumbled to smooth, rounded stones. Because of its bright color, it was primarily used for jewelry and decoration. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This gemstone was used in the crafting of cubic gates , luckstones , and in the creation of devices that offered protection from evil or from bodily harm. Carrying or wearing a carnelian generally improved the owner's luck by a small amount. A properly prepared and enchanted carnelian could be sacrificed in dire need to gain a second chance at some failed feat of strength, ability, or survival. The person had to immediately touch the special stone, which then disappeared in a flash of bright light, and try again.</p>
<p>In the city of Mezro in Chult , some wizards crafted small enchanted carnelian stones, covered in countless magical runes. When the stone was put on one's tongue, it melted like elven candy , although it tasted heinous, like orcish goulash . This enchanted game gave the imbiber the ability to speak and understand the Tabaxi language for three days.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Dreaming about, or having visions of carnelians was considered an omen of misfortune by many seers and oracles. The stones were also sacred to the churches of Bane , Erevan Ilesere , Gaerdal Ironhand , and Haela Brightaxe .</p>
