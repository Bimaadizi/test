<p>In 1369 DR , Iyrtaryld was smoking at a meeting with several of his fellow Red Wizards, where he demonstrated an illusion of his newest magical development, the Hungry Mouth : a spell to snatch anything that wasn't nailed down into a portal, bringing it to Thay with them. His plan was to eat whatever couldn't be coerced to work. While he got some feedback on it, the table at which they sat was hurled upwards by a colossal entity made of stone which smashed its fist down on him, killing him instantly. That was the Simbul 's doing.</p>
