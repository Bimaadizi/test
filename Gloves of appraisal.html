<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gloves of appraisal were commonly owned by the most prosperous merchants of Waterdeep before the Time of Troubles . Following the goddess' mysterious disappearance, most of the gloves of appraisal were sold by their owners who were disillusioned with the subject of their goddess not answering their prayers following the end of the Godswar. This made the gloves of appraisal a common item on the markets of the Sword Coast , following the Merchant's Friend freedom and return to power in 1370 DR . By 1372 DR , these gloves could be found in many cities along the coast, such as Neverwinter , Daggerford , and even in the ports of the Nelanther Isles .</p>
