<p>Jeklpa vine was a plant that grew in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These thorny vines could grow up and around structures. The vines, leaves, and thorns all contained a potent paralytic poison that was visible upon a close look. If the sharp thorns broke a creature's skin, this poison oozed out, and if someone attempted to slash or hack through the vines, it could spurt into their face. Exposure to the poison could cause paralysis for up to 40 minutes. If the jeklpa was destroyed, the poison lost its potency and drained harmlessly from the plant.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In the jungle, creatures paralyzed by jeklpa vines were quickly set upon by predators. The rotting remains of these creatures then became food for the jeklpa.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>The Kuro goblins of Chult were known to have jeklpa vines growing on the fences of their slave pens to prevent their captives from escaping.</p>
