<p>A quiver of Mielikki , also known as a quiver of Solonor , and as a quiver of Ehlonna on Oerth and other worlds, was a magical quiver that could hold a large number of weapons and ammunition without ever increasing its volume or weight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The quiver of Mielikki appeared like a well-crafted but otherwise mundane quiver, weighing only 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) and sized to apparently hold only twenty arrows . It had three compartments of different lengths. If examined with detect magic , it bore an aura of the alteration or conjuration school of magic .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the quiver's compartments connected to an extradimensional space that could hold a variety of items without increasing the quiver's weight. The smallest compartment could hold up to sixty arrows or other items of similar size and shape. The medium compartment was slightly longer and could hold up to eighteen javelins or comparable objects. The largest and longest compartment could hold up to six objects of the size of quarterstaffs , spears , or longbows . Thus, it could store up to 84 items in total.</p>
<p>The bearer of the quiver only had to command it to produce a item, provided it had already been placed inside. Drawing an object from it required no more effort than drawing from a normal quiver.</p>
<p>Shandie Freefoot's quiver only held up to sixty arrows, but magically replenished their supply.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>In order to craft a quiver of Mielikki , it was necessary to know the Leomund's secret chest spell .</p>
<h2>Availability & Reputation</h2>
<p>It could be purchased for 1,800 gp and sold for up to 10,000 gp .</p>
<p>As their names suggested, these magical quivers were associated with the faiths of Mielikki , the Supreme Ranger, and Solonor Thelandira , the Great Archer. The Solonorans prized them alongside other magical quivers and bows.</p>
<p>Quivers of Mielikki were favored by Damaran humans and they were common in their lands. They could be bought for 10% less than normal in the larger cities of Damara and Impiltur .</p>
