<p>Porrenath , the Second City of the Sword, was one of the first major cities in the empire of Jhaamdath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Second City lay a short distance northeast of the First City, Naarkolyth , on the southern edge of the Orsraun Mountains . After its destruction, it lay in the Selmal Basin beneath the waters of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Porrenath was founded in −5600 DR , becoming the second of Jhaamdath's major cities.</p>
<p>A period of bloody imperial expansionism started in the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , which resulted in the logging of the Chondalwood and the massacre of the Nikerymath elves . The elves responded in the −255 DR by performing a High Magic ritual that created a great wave from the Inner Sea that tore out of Jhaamdath Bay and washed over the Cities of the Sword, carving out the Vilhon Reach in the process. Porrenath remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its many psionic artifacts slowly leaking into the water and affecting the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . This was almost as quickly reversed in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering hiding the ruins once more.</p>
