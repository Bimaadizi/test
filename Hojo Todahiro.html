<p>Hojo Todahiro was the exiled former shogun of Kozakura in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Todahiro was the son of shogun Hojo Kikutake . In 1341 DR , when Todahiro was seventeen, his father died following a fall from his horse. Immediately thereafter, controversy arose over who should succeed as shogun. Because Todahiro was not yet of age, a shikken regent was required. If he were to succeed his father as shogun, then the shikken would rule for only a short while; conversely, if Todahiro's two-year-old son were to be appointed, then the shikken would be in power for many years. This division soon proved violent, and the Hojo War began in 1342 DR .</p>
<p>Following his defeat, Todahiro and his supporters were exiled to the island of Kanshu , and the young Hojo Kawakubo became shogun.</p>
<p>Manipulated by his mother Hojo Haru and her father, the shikken Takenaka Okawa , the new shogun was from the beginning merely a puppet to the true rulers of Kozakura.</p>
<p>Todahiro plotted to reclaim his position, but he was kept under the watch of Lord Betsui Kando , and observed by spies of all factions.</p>
<p>In 1347 DR , Hojo Todahiro convened his fleet at the island of Norinoshima , utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when Takenaka Sugawara led a fleet of ships and men against them. The ensuing battle on the island marked the end of the Hojo War, resulting in the defeat of Hojo Todahiro's forces.</p>
