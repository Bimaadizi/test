<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR, the Butcher and his cave goblin tribe allied with Gorgomorz's army of orcs and tanarukka. A part of the army established a hideout in caves underneath the Wild Pastures of Liam's Hold . Despite orders, the Butcher ordered his goblins to abduct cows from the local shepherds. The strange occurrence attracted the attention of the Hero of Daggerford , who agreed to help the shepherds in investigating the disappearances. Eventually, goblin tracks led the Hero towards the well-hidden goblin lair. The adventurer walked in on the Butcher's attempts at convincing his tanarukk superior that the cow carcass the goblin was standing on was, in fact, a cow-shaped rock. Eventually, the inhabitants of the caves attacked the trespasser and perished in the process.</p>
