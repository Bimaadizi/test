<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Magma drakes resembled 12‑foot-long (3.7‑meter) dragons with scales that looked like cooling lava and crimson eyes. They were surprisingly agile despite a superficially slow and clumsy appearance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Magma drakes were said to be malevolent creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Magma drakes had an affinity for both earth and fire: they could detect creatures that moved on the ground, and could burn enemies with their very touch.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Magma drakes preferred to attack enemies one at a time, using flight to separate foes from their group if possible, before watching pinned victims burn to death.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Magma drakes typically lived in deep caverns or volcanic craters, especially those with water nearby. They were known to ally with efreeti and salamanders .</p>
