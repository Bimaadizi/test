<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical dragon's bite was made using pale translucent green mint wine , pepper brandy , cinnamon powder, and licorice root.</p>
<p>The resulting mixed drink was minty-cool, with a licorice aftertaste. Dragon's bite was not sweet nor bitter. It ended with the "bite", hot spicy cinnamon burn at the back of the drinker's throat.</p>
