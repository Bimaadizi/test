<h2>History</h2>
<p>Intulik of the Blood used his magics and political prowess to gain power sometime before 1372 DR, assassinating his political opposition. Eventually, he rose to power over non- Mezroan Chultan tribes. However, the subjection was short-lived. Intulik's career was ended via the sword of a bounty hunter called Tatchalik. He claimed the Spirit of the Predator , the enchanted helmet created by Intulik, as his payment and left Chult for Waterdeep , proudly displaying the new magical trophy.</p>
