<p>Jarval Keth was a Mulan explorer. He discovered the symbol marking the entrance to the hidden Imaskari level in Maskana .</p>
<p>After finding an unusual version of the crescent and the fox pictographs in Maskana, Jarval researched these symbols at Gheldaneth , first asking around in the temples, and then in the Great University. He had been seen in the company of a man with a pale, skull-like face; he was captured by Tyaral at around this point. Jarval had barely managed to escape Sithena Tinzon , Tyaral's chief inquisitor, by boarding a ship.</p>
<p>Jarval managed to blurt out a few clues to some adventurers before Sithena Tinzon found him. He might've survived the fight that almost certainly ensued; if so, only a heal spell could've cured the mental sequels of his torture. Should those adventurers have defeated Tyaral at Maskana, he was likely to have hired them to explore the lower levels of the ruin.</p>
