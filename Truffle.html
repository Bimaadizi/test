<p>Truffles were a species of rare edible mushrooms found in several areas of the Realms , including the marshy areas around the High Forest in Northwest Faerûn , the Dalelands , and in the Mhair Jungles , west of the wizardly nation of Halruaa in South Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Truffles were plump, fragrant, and meaty mushrooms that could grow the size of an adult elf 's fist. They had a savory taste. They were also a well-known favorite food of wild boars and hogs who tirelessly rooted the ground with their tusks and snouts in pursuit of the beloved underground morsels. In a similar manner, wereboars were sensitive to the aroma of truffles and could smell them in the humanoid form as deep as several feet underground.</p>
