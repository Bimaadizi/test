<p>"Lord Wolf" was the title adopted by a brigand who once ruled over the area of Highbank Forest in the Vast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Styling himself as "Lord Wolf", he laid claim to the area and the ruined keep atop the local hill and set himself up as its ruler. He lived in hiding in an outlying cottage, and only rallied his followers at the keep prior to a raid. For many years, Lord Wolf and his gang preyed upon caravans, until the cities of Ravens Bluff and Tantras together raised an army to crush the bandit lord.</p>
<p>Later, the villagers of Highbank Forest mistakenly remembered the keep as the base of Lord Wolf.</p>
