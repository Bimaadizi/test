<p>The Black Mist gang was a yakuza group in Nakamaru in Wa in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Seemingly powerful across Wa, the Black Mist were recently established in Nakamaru by 1357 DR . The Black Mist tried to control all illegal business in the city, entering into feuds with the both Big Head and Worthless Flower gangs, who were cautious in trying to destroy the Black Mist.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Black Mist followed the normally family-like hierarchy but were also divided into different branches, based on the type of illegal activity: one for gambling, one for protection, and, unique to the Black Mist, the gurentai , thugs that often attacked the Big Head bases.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Black Mist did not have the city authorities' recognition so they were always on their guard against the police and local samurai . Instead, they forged an alliance with traders of the foreign districts, especially merchants from Shou Lung .</p>
