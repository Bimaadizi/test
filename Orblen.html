<p>Orblen was a rare gemstone unique to the Realms and highly prized along the Sword Coast North . Due to its rich color, it was sometimes called honeystone . The largest known Orblen was 6 in (15 cm) across and was held by King Azoun IV of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although rare, orblen occurred in massive deposits that yielded large gems that could be cut cabochon or faceted. Its nickname came from the deep, lustrous gold hue that resembled honey . A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Honeystone had two very different responses to magic cast upon it. If any healing spell was cast into the stone, it produced a golden glow that warmed and illuminated everything in a 60 ft (18.3 m) radius that lasted for two hours. Beings touched by this radiance were immediately granted the benefits of a potion of vitality , and anyone that remained within the glow for a full, continuous hour received a healing on the order of an extra-potent cure light wounds . However, if a spell from the invocation/evocation school or the combat sphere of divine magic was cast upon an orblen, it detonated in a short-range, triple meteor swarm —a dozen 2 ft (61 cm) balls of flame, equally spaced around the center as points on a compass, out to a distance of 20 ft (6.1 m)—with devastating effect. Due to overlapping spheres in the confined space, anyone or anything near the orblen when it exploded was likely to be hit by multiple meteors.</p>
