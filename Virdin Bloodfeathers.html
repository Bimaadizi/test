<p>Virdin Bloodfeathers was the king of Damara in the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Virdin was a young and kind ruler who was much respected by many of his subjects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Virdin was King of Damara during the Vaasan War against Zhengyi the Witch-King , although he was still quite young as the decade-long war came to an end in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , when he personally led the Damaran armies at the Ford of Goliad .</p>
<p>Virdin was tricked into believing that a magic wand provided to him would enable his army to cross the Ford undetected and defeat the Vaasan host. It was widely believed in Damara that he was deceived into believing this by Felix , his own chief lieutenant. Zhengyi was waiting for Virdin to make this mistake, and inflicted a thorough defeat upon the Damaran army while they were helpless in the river. Virdin was on a nearby hill watching these events unfold when he was assassinated by a dagger . It is believed that Felix was also responsible for this act.</p>
