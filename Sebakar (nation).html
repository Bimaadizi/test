<p>Sebakar was a nation of lycanthropes , most notably werecrocodiles , located in the Adder Swamp of Chessenta in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sebakar was a stratified nation ruled by a werecrocodile nobility who called themselves the "Children of Sebakar". The lower class comprised wererats , who served as laborers and merchants.</p>
<p>The nation's name was derived from the Untheric name for Sebek , the werecrocodiles' patron god .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sebakar claimed the entirety of the insect-infested Adder Swamp as their domain, and the entire wetland became synonymous with Sebakar. This meant that the nation stretched from the Bay of Chessenta in the east to Lake Akax in the west, and from the city-state of Luthcheq in the south to the delta of the River Akax in the north.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The nation was ruled by the werecrocodile nobles. Their capital was well-hidden in ancient sunken ruins that dated to the time when Chessenta was under the rule of the Second Untheric Empire .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Sebakar's only notable trade partner was Erebos , with whom they did business via the small trading post of Thurik . Salt was the most valuable commodity found within the werecrocodiles' domain, so much so that Chessentan merchants were willing to brave the Adder Swamp's dangers to acquire it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Werecrocodiles had originally come to the Adder Swamp after being expelled from Mulhorand in the Year of the Grisly Ghosts, 1183 DR . There they founded the City of the Werecrocodiles and immediately came into conflict with the local wererat population, who were seen as lesser beings deserving of being enslaved . It was not until after the Spellplague of the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , and the subsequent expansion of the Adder Swamp to dominate most of the western coast of the Bay of Chessenta, that the nation of Sebakar was founded and the wererats were subdued.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , the werecrocodile nation had moved its capital to an ancient ruin that had been flooded and forgotten about by the Chessentans centuries prior. Sebakar was on good diplomatic terms with the city of Erebos to their north and was an important power in Chessenta by that time, which had been an aspiration of the lycanthropes since the mid-to-late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The werecrocodiles of Sebakar were known to eat human flesh. Even if visitors survived an encounter with one of them, their bite had the potential to infect humanoids with lockjaw .</p>
<p>Unsurprising given their self-styled moniker as "Children of Sebakar", the werecrocodiles worshiped Sebek/Sebakar, an archfey and minor deity of the Mulhorandi pantheon . It was rumored that Sebek/Sebakar himself dwelt somewhere deep within the swamps of Sebakar, although there had been no sign of him for decades as of 1480 DR.</p>
