<p>Ouwoonivisc the Infected was an unwilling rogue mind flayer in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ouwoonivisc was somehow infected by Lolth before 1488 DR and spread the infection to all the illithid hive mind.</p>
<p>Thank to this link, Asbeel used Ouwoonivisc to sabotage the power of the hive mind and thanks to this Kimmuriel Oblodra failed to support Wulfgar in his fight against Brevindon Margaster .</p>
<p>Kimmuriel sensed something strange about Ouwoonivisc, namely that it was more chaotic than its fellow illithids. Kimmuriel Oblodra expressed his doubts about Ouwoonivisc to Most Endeared Pescatawav . Working together, Pescatawav and Kimmuriel discovered that Ouwoonivisc had been infected by Lolth and was unwillingly disturbing the hive mind, so Kimmuriel and Pescatawav destroyed Ouwoonivisc.</p>
