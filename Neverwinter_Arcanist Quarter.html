<p>The Arcanist Quarter was one of the districts of Neverwinter prior to the midâ€“15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Arcanist Quarter was located in the southeastern portion of the city, near the Beggar's Nest .</p>
<p>It was built around a lavish cathedral to Mystra .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the eruption of Mount Hotenow , wizards and sorcerers from across the Sword Coast came to the Arcanist Quarter to pursue their studies and fraternize with colleagues in the mystic arts.</p>
<h3>Eruption</h3>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Arcanist Quarter was almost completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. The huge, canyon-like Chasm replaced most of the district, however a portion of the Arcanist Quarter remained floating several hundred feet down inside the ravine. It was presumed that the high concentration of arcane magic in the neighborhood had caused this part to become an earthmote .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Arcanist Quarter was home to many spellcasters , hence the name of the district. The area known as Apprentice Row housed a motley assortment of wannabe mages and students.</p>
<p>Notable inhabitants prior to the Ruining included Roderick the Wary .</p>
