<p>Skarn Rock was a tiny island just a stone's throw from the mainland of the Sword Coast near Baldur's Gate in western Faer√ªn . Smugglers and pirates used it as a clandestine meeting place, and it was the hub of the network of portals known as Lost Princess Road .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This "island" was a narrow strip of bare rock just 60 feet (18 meters) from the cliffs of the mainland slightly north of the mouth of the River Chionthar where it emptied into the Sea of Swords . Skarn Rock was about as long as two galleons set end-to-end and oriented in a north-south direction.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The interstitial area between Skarn Rock and the shore was filled with jagged rocks that prevented safe travel by boat, but the island could be approached from the seaward side and even had a tiny cove at the northern end in which a rowboat could be moored. The surface was roughly 12 feet (3.7 meters) above high tide and constantly wet with sea spray. It was particularly hazardous in winter when ice formed. On the somewhat drier side facing the mainland were four shallow pits carved out of the stone arranged in two pairs very close together. These were the portals of Lost Princess Road.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The pirates gave Skarn Rock its name after the body of a fellow brigand named Skarn was found dead on the island after a failed smuggling deal. The enchanted depressions of the four portals were well over a thousand years old, as of the 1370s DR.</p>
