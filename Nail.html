<p>Nails were a simple and vital kind of fastener that were used in many types of carpentry and construction in the Realms . They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included bolts , spikes , rivets , and pegs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nails were typically between 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) and 4‑inch (10‑centimeter) long (any longer and they were considered spikes), and were most often made from iron . Depending on their method of manufacture, they could be made with a round or square cross-section.</p>
<p>A common variation was the eye spike , an extra-long nail that would be driven into a tree or wooden wall which could then be bent into a simple ring, such as for securing ropes .</p>
<p>Aside from bolts, spikes, and pegs, nails also had a strong resemblance to needles and stakes .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Alongside other forms of common ironmongery, nails were widely produced by artisans in Faerûn to keep up with constant demand. They were often made by apprentice blacksmiths who worked on other simple, useful items such as spikes and hooks .</p>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of nails and related tools in various configurations and sizes, including 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) finishing nails (2 sp /lb) and 2‑inch (5.1‑centimeter) or 3‑inch (7.6‑centimeter) joiners' nails (1 sp/lb).</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Nails were mainly used to join wood in carpentry or construction projects. Before being hammered into wood, the nail hole could be prepared using an awl to make an indentation, or partially bored out with a bow drill . Special nail hammers could be found which had a claw for ripping out nails.</p>
<p>Crude weapons could be enhanced by embedding metal nails within wood, such as the greatclub .</p>
<p>Nails and pegs were commonly used for ship construction in Faerûn , while in Zakhara this was avoided, with ship timbers instead sewn together with coconut fiber rope . This produced lighter ships that better handled reefs and shoals, and allowed them to survive the influence of a great lodestone deposit beneath the Crowded Sea .</p>
<p>In the ancient Netherese city of Scourge , the region's unnatural rusting winds meant that nails (and any other metal fittings, tools, and weapons) were useless. Instead, wooden nails were used for construction.</p>
