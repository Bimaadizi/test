<h2>History</h2>
<p>Slogg Ogrum was a mysterious individual who single-handedly laid siege to the town of Priapurl in the Eastern Heartlands in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR . The orc was defeated by the Mindgulph Mercenary Company , but his body was never found, nor could they find any reason for the siege, making Slogg's motivation a complete mystery. The only thing Slogg left behind was an impressive collection of weapons that included the powerful crossbow later known as Ogrum's Siegebow.</p>
