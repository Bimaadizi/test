<p>Waerva Baenre was a drow priestess of Lolth in Menzoberranzan and a member of House Baenre in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The priestess always wished to elevate her status in drow society. She often liked to get massages at the Silken Rack .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Silence of Lolth in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Waerva sought to increase her power by framing the ambassador of Ched Nasad , Faeryl Zauvirr , with plotting against Matron Mother Triel Baenre . However, Faeryl managed to survive an assassination attempt ordered by Waerva, thanks to the aid of Bregan D'aerthe , who'd been recruited by Triel to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Faeryl spoke to Triel, telling her that to end the Silence of Lolth they needed to ally Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad. Triel agreed with Faeryl and vowed to find the person responsible for the false accusation against Faeryl. When Waerva discovered this, she tried to escape from Menzoberranzan, fearing the wrath of the matron mother. However, she was ambushed and presumably killed by some kobolds , former slaves who had escaped after Syrzan 's failed insurrection.</p>
