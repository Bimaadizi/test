<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR , when Arderiel was just 22 winters old, Arelin Starbrow , the heroic Roadwarden , perished in a treacherous monster ambush on the High Road . Her set of enchanted arms—the symbol of the office—were lost to the monsters. Subsequently, Yemandra Starbrow was tasked by her father with recovering the Lance of the Roadwarden . In her stead, Yemandra sent Tornilee, who was to join a group of caravan guards in the arms' recovery. Together the group headed to a cavern claimed by hill giants who, along with other creatures, slew the Roadwarden. Tornilee battled through hordes of giants, and eventually they faced the true leader of the monsters: a gluttonous blue dragon nicknamed Draconnis . After the wyrm was defeated, Tornilee and the adventurers retrieved the Lance of the Roadwarden from the dragon's hoard.</p>
