<p>The land of Netheril was the land largely occupied by the nation of Netheril during the beginning of the Age of Humanity . This article covers the region from the birth of Netheril to the fall in −339 DR when Karsus's Folly effectively ended the nation. For information outside this time period see the Lost Kingdoms and Anauroch articles.</p>
<h2>Society and Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The High Netherese floated around in relative isolation, but the low Netherese shared the realm with a number of other inhabitants and creatures.</p>
<p>While the low netherese primarily settled around the Narrow Sea and the Eastern region of Anauroch along the Netheril River , and the Banks of Hidden Lake, the tribes of Rengarth patrolled the tundra to the north, and the plains south of the Bay of Ascore in the West . The Rengarth built a series of permanent trading settlements with the Netherese , and had a schism when a portion of the tribe, the Angardt began to learn magic from their neighbors.</p>
<p>This conflict resulted in the Angardt being chased from the north, and they migrated to the Flats in the south, where they built Kismet as a permanent trading location.</p>
<p>Other humans fell to Netherese conquest , or plagues . Some rebelled against Netheril, and worked with the phaerimm to bring about Netheril's fall, such as the raider Olostin , and the Kozah worshiping inhabitants of Monikar .</p>
<p>In the early days of Netheril, much expense was paid to establish trade routes to the Delzoun dwarves of Ascore , and elves taught the fledgling humans magic.</p>
<p>Attempts were made to trade with goblins around the Bay of Ascore, which resulted in goblins claiming the town of Cantus when their goods were rejected by dwarves and other Netherese.</p>
<p>The Amanir Cloud giants lived in the northern peaks of the Channel Mountains in relative isolation, and were sid to have rescued some Netherese during the fall.</p>
<p>Orcs were a threat throughout most of the region throughout the time of Netheril.</p>
<p>Lizardmen occupied the Marsh of Simplicity and Marsh of Deception .</p>
<p>Eventually Phaerimm from the Buried Realms turned the region to desert with their magic, creating the Anauroch , and most of the survivors fled to the surrounding regions of Faerûn.</p>
<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Netheril was a verdant land, until the coming of the phaerimm . In −461 DR , the phaerimm began to cast spells that caused the lush land to change into desert. In 10 DR , the region became known as Anauroch to reflect the desert that it had become.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>During the time of Netheril the following places existed in the region that is now the Anauroch , for more recent geography, see that entry.</p>
<h3>Forests and Plains</h3>
<h3>Mountains & Hills</h3>
<h3>Bodies of Water</h3>
<p>The Narrow Sea was the largest and most important body of water in the region, providing the majority of food for Netheril , and was heated by Mythallars until they failed during the fall, causing it to be slowly swallowed by the High Ice.</p>
<p>The Bay of Ascore , known for the stone ships the dwarves of Ascore patrolled the cold deep waters with, was the Northwestern arm of the Narrow Sea, and dried up after the the fall of Netheril. Its two major tributaries were the Waterbourne River north of Ascore from Delzoun lands in the west, and a more extensive northern system.</p>
<p>From the High Ice the often frozen over Weimar River flowed into volcano heated Oxbow Lake , to the Macht River*, to steamy Portolake down the Meiter River before spilling into the bay.</p>
<p>'*There are two Macht rivers labeled on the map, the other was to the south near Macht Lake , and mentioned in that concordance . Finick Flow , frozen for 9 months of the year, but otherwise unmentioned, may have been this stretch of river.</p>
<p>Paw Bay in the north eastern Narrow Sea was named for the Paw Islands and known for its sea life, including seals and walruses. It was fed by two major tributary systems.</p>
<p>The High Tributary fed Nanza Lake from the northwest with its tributary The Backwash</p>
<p>The Netheril River ran north to the Narrow Sea by Seventon, and provided a relatively safe route for transport of goods and people all the way south to Dagger's Point along the Eastern Forest, causing many towns to be built around it, and making it the most important river in Netheril. It was fed by a number of tributaries, including Gers River and Gustaf River , which wound south of Patrician Peak, both named for villages of Seventon. Gillan River had a Temple to Selune built at the headwaters after the Abbey of the Moon burned down. Nauseef Flow began in the Firehorn Peaks.</p>
<p>In a relatively uninhabited length the river swelled into Macht Lake which was full of merrow, and also fed by Zeig River as well as its tributaries, the Macht River and Fenwick River which served as a irrigation source for farmers.</p>
<p>Past Macht Lake, Janick River flowed from the Shadowtop Alp west to Netheril River</p>
<p>At the delta of the Watercourse, where it met the Narrow Sea, the Marsh of Simplicity was a dangerous swampy area occupied by lizardmen until the Anauroch overran it. The Watercourse itself was a major source of fish for the southern Rengarth. Its tributary from the Channel Mountains Ischlome River was itself fed by the Hadely River that flowed from the Columns of the Sky. In the plains further south, the Tempera Channel was a system of canals designed to water thousands of acres of crops.</p>
<p>In the central plains of western Netheril, Heip Lake was an important source of bass and trout, which were exported across Netheril and Delzoun. . It was fed by the whitewaters of the Wont Surge and extremely long Zweihaus River to the south, as well as the Conch River , considered sacred by the Rengarth, and its tributary Pommel Estuary from the Columns of the sky in the north.</p>
<p>Zweihaus River was named after two extremely long houses that were once said to float on the river , and aside from the Westview River that supported farms in the western plains of Netheril , the Zweihaus had a number of tributaries in the far southwest. The southernmost Moray River was known for its clear waters and eels Just north of the Moray, Redguard Lake was believed to be haunted by undead after a slaughter of Angardt by kobolds long ago , and was fed by the Sunderiver , a favorite fishing spot of the Angardt .</p>
<p>Basin Lake was a deep lake created by an earthquake in southeastern Netheril, stocked with fish by followers of Jannath, and fed by Jackal Crick , as well as the Hale River which flowed through Opus from the God's Legion Mountains to the East . A low area to the southwest of the basin created the Marsh of Amnesty .</p>
<p>Hidden Lake was nestled between the Shinantra Mountains to the west, Lodestar Mountains to the east, and Hidden Forest to the north in the middle of the plains of Netheril. A number of settlements on the banks sustainably harvested lumber to avoid conflict with Slyphs of Hidden Forest, and steered clear of the trolls in caves on the southeastern banks. It was fed by a number of tributaries.</p>
