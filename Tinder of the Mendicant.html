<p>Tinder of the Mendicant were raggedy red robes enchanted with deadly fire defensive magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tinder of the Mendicant was a crimson red robe, torn and rugged, appearing unsightly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tinder of the Mendicant provided no enchantment to the wearer armor nor defenses, instead it exploded upon being hit with the effect similar to the flaming hide spell. These flames did not damage the wearer. Additionally, the robes allowed the wearer to summon a flame weapon twice a day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The true origins of the Tinder of the Mendicant were wrapped in mystery. The first documented appearance was sometime before 1372 DR , worn by a beggar for many years. The item's magic became apparent when the unnamed vagabond was attacked by a gang of marauding bandits who wanted to murder the beggar for fun. To the murderous scum's displeasure, the Tinder of the Mendicant set them aflame, forcing them to run for the nearby brook.</p>
<p>This story became popular among other beggars and encouraged them to wear crimson rags in hopes of providing them with the security of scaring would-be attackers off. Eventually, the beggars robed in red became infrequent, yet the bandits were still unwilling to approach them.</p>
<p>Subsequently, by 1372 DR, Tinder of the Mendicant found its way to the city of Daggerford in possession of a Thayan Red Wizard and a spy named Ilkor .</p>
