<p>Malachlabra was an archfiend and the daughter of Dispater in the late 14 th century DR . She was ambushed by the Simbul in 1372Â DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Malachlabra was humanoid in form, with comely features and a lush body as black as obsidian. She had fingers ending in talons the length of a man's arm, sleek bat wings ruby red on the outside and black on the inside, and three snake tails, at least one of which ended in a glossy black spade-shape.</p>
<p>Her horned head sat upon her unnaturally long neck. Behind her red, beautiful lips was a forked tongue, while a flame burned at the back of her ale-brown eyes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She could cast or use a sphere of seeing , which allowed her to scry , but it failed when brought to look at its own environment. She was also capable of some amount of short-range teleportation, and of throwing her consciousness into even the least object to escape her own death. The spade-shape at her tail end was sharp enough to slash while being whipped.</p>
<p>She had the ability to contact another person's mind, and was confident of her ability to remove other archdevils' influence from humans' minds. She could also spit fire.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Malachlabra claimed to be the daughter of Dispater. She considered Nergal a brute.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, she had slain a dragon for its lair. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , she briefly came across Elminster Aumar while he was being tormented by Nergal. Though she volunteered to free the old wizard from Nergal's mental influence, she was bested by him.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the Simbul stormed Avernus trying to rescue Elminster. Nergal had transformed Elminster and hid him in Malachlabra's lair, luring the Simbul towards his rival; the Simbul quickly ambushed and destroyed Malachlabra, who just barely survived by hiding her sapience in a spark and fleeing. She survived, barely.</p>
