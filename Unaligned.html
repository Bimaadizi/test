<p>Being unaligned was the state of a lack of capacity for making moral decisions, whether that be due to reticence, or the natural inability to make such choices.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Creatures lacking intelligence (or those who had animal -like intelligence) or sentience were unaligned. Even though some were savage, such as sharks , such creatures were only this way due to their bestial nature and predatory instincts. Essentially, such beings could only act on instinct, and thus could not comprehend good or evil , and law or chaos .</p>
<p>In terms of reticence, unaligned individuals were ones who did not take a stand for either good, evil, or neutrality . Being unaligned indicated that someone may have been benign or undecided about their morality.</p>
<p>Objects, except those which were sentient, were unaligned. As such, a know alignment spell would reveal nothing about them.</p>
