<p>Lyran Nanther was a member of the Nanther family of Melvaunt in the Moonsea in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He was known as Lyran the Pretender for his claim to rule over Shadowdale in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A member of the Nanther family of Melvaunt, he later became a lieutenant of the Zhentarim agent Jyordhan . Jyordhan even chose Lyran to succeed him as Lord of Shadowdale .</p>
<p>But in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , Jyordhan was killed by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun , who took the Pendant of Ashaba away to Waterdeep and promised to send a suitable person to rule Shadowdale. Lyran had no way to legitimize his claim to the lordship and was considered a pretender. This marked the beginning of the Time of No Lords in Shadowdale, when the land was leaderless, which ended three years later when Khelben gave the Pendant to the Knights of Myth Drannor and Doust Sulwood ascended the lordship, who was later succeeded by Mourngrym Amcathra . Lyran and his followers made various incursions into Shadowdale, but were repelled, largely thanks to the Knights of Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>Zhentil Keep eventually lent Lyran an army of Zhentilar and Banite priests in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , however. With it, he made various incursions and attacked Shadowdale to wrest the lordship from Mourngrym in the First Battle of Shadowdale , but his army was routed in a heroic defense. Lyran was forced to leave and was presumed killed.</p>
<p>When Melvaunt's Council of Lords discovered Lyran's association with Zhentil Keep after this defeat, they had the Nanther family banished from Melvaunt.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>While in Shadowdale as a lieutenant of Jyordhan, Lyran and the other lieutenants lived in a manor house built for them in an area known as the Bog.</p>
