<p>Derwin Stonecarver was a shield dwarf of Clan Ironeater who lived in Daggerford during the 13 th and 14 th centuries DR.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to the anvil -shaped altar of Imix Derwin brought home from his travels, he also possessed an enchanted warhammer which was buried with him when he died. Derwin's hammer was the only means to destroy the altar and retrieve the elemental Fire Key sealed within it.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The frescoes painted on Derwin's sarcophagus showed that in addition to his discovery of the altar, he was remembered for drinking much ale and battling many orcs , though he ultimately died of natural causes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Derwin was a brother to Derval Ironeater and Korin Ironaxe . He was the youngest of the three. Derwin was well-loved by his brothers, and they commissioned a granite statue of him after his passing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Year of the Killing Wave, 1257 DR , when the Ironeater clan abandoned their home beneath Mount Illefarn , Derwin took up travelling. During his travels, he came to possess a massive altar in the shape of an anvil, which he mistakenly believed was dedicated to Moradin . When he returned to his brothers who had settled in Daggerford, Korin interpreted the altar's arrival as an omen that it was time to return to their tunnels.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , during the earthquake that struck Daggerford , Derwin and his two sons were trapped beneath the rubble when the town barracks' north wall partially collapsed.</p>
