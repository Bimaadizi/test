<p>Wolfsbane was an enchanted handaxe from northwest Faerûn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Despite appearing to be nothing but an ordinary handaxe, Wolfsbane was lightly etched with runes of power along the axe head that brightened and dimmed seemingly at random. The runes glowed brightly when a beast or an animal was near. Each strike with Wolfsbane dealt additional damage to beasts, effectively becoming a weapon with a potent +2 enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The owner of Wolfsbane lived in shack in the forest along the Trade Way, near the city of Luskan . The owner perished sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR, leaving the magic weapon for the taking.</p>
