<p>A supernatural gift was a magical and intangible enhancement or power bestowed on mortals by powerful entities often as a reward for their services or deeds. When given by a deity or other godlike being, such a gift was often called a blessing and could confer permanent benefits to the recipient. Lesser gifts were often known as charms , and were more limited or temporary but could come from many sources. Sinister gifts from powerful demons or devils were sometimes known as boons , and were used to empower their mortal cultists.</p>
<h2>Blessings</h2>
<p>Only when a mortal's deeds warranted the attention of the gods could they hope to receive a divine blessing. In the rare cases when a blessing was gifted, it was often to reward something like restoring a god's most sacred shrine, ending an earthshaking plot by a god's enemies, aiding a god's favored servant in a divine quest, or embarking on a quest of a great urgency to a god. In some cases, a god's blessing might be channeled, requested, or bequeathed through their angelic servants, their priests , their Chosen , or a recipients of their prior blessings.</p>
<p>Gods always bestowed blessings that granted powers or capabilities useful to the recipient, and the most common blessings tended to provide abilities or enhancements similar to magic items . These powers could not be suppressed by any normal means (e.g., with an antimagic field or similar power), and a god's blessing could not be lost unless the same god chose to revoke it. This might happen if the recipient lost the god's favor or if their actions failed to advance some purpose that the god had intended for them to achieve.</p>
<p>Elder evils were also said to grant warped blessings, although these were usually channeled and bestowed by their cultists who discovered them only after many years of trial and error. While such blessings were often rewards for service to a cult, they might also be given to those who had lapsed or failed in their cult duties in order to provide them power needed for a chance at redemption.</p>

<h2>Charms</h2>
<p>Charms were more common and much weaker than divine blessings, and granted the recipient an extraordinary ability that could be used one or more times (depending on the specific charm). They could be gained by learning eldritch secrets, interacting with a location of ancient magic, appeasing powerful spirits , or gaining the favor a mighty creature —such as an angel, couatl , dragon , fiend , lich , sphinx , or unicorn , —or of certain ascended or empowered people—such as the gods' Chosen, the vassals of archdevils , especially powerful wizards , or immortal individuals who had amassed many lifetimes of resources. Such creatures and people were known to use charms to empower their allies and their servants (such as some warlocks to whom they served as a patron ). Another type of creature notable for gifting charms was the chwinga —small elementals attuned to nature—who could grant such gifts once each day and were prone to do so for people who intrigued or were kind to them. It was also possible to create magic items, mechanisms, or even food that could bestow charms, and such items were crafted by the likes of the archlich Acererak and the Netherese arcanists of Ythryn .</p>
<p>Charms often allowed the recipient a limited number of times to cast a certain spell (without the need for material components ) or to replicate the effects of a certain potion . They vanished once their uses were spent or after a time limit expired, but could not otherwise be removed except by divine intervention or a wish . The magical effects of a charm could be suppressed by means such as antimagic field , dispel magic , and similar spells.</p>

<h2>Other Supernatural Gifts</h2>
<h3>Dark Gifts</h3>
<p>Dark gifts were similar to charms, but were conferred by dark gods and sinister forces within the Domains of Dread , potentially even the Dark Powers themselves. Such dark gifts often entailed insidious influence over the recipient by the giver, and might just as often seem to arise from a curse as from a bargain or reward.</p>
<h3>Demonic Boons</h3>
<p>Demonic boons were evil powers bestowed by demons that inevitably corrupted and damned the soul of any who received one, driving them to madness. Any demon was able to grant a limited number of boons to mortals seeking their power, with more powerful demons able to grant more boons and demon lords able to grant an unlimited number, which they used to gather and empower cults. Such boons were as fickle as the demons themselves, however, and their benefits would fade as soon as the bestowing demon became displeased. If a demon offered a boon and was refused, it was a terrible insult.</p>
<h3>Diabolic Boons</h3>
<p>The gifts and boons offered by archdevils were often intended to tempt susceptible mortals into serving them and to empower their followers. This included delegating the power to offer archdevil charms to their servants, who used them to sweeten the offers of infernal contracts. The types of gifts they could bestow were ultimately determined by Asmodeus .</p>
<h3>Draconic Gifts</h3>
<p>It was said that upon the death of a dragon, its power could take root in a mortal—whether that dragon's ally or its slayer—and manifest as a draconic gift . These gifts were said to vary widely in power and usefulness, and to be often accompanied by minor physical changes to the recipient's body.</p>
<h3>Feywild Gifts</h3>
<p>Fey were said to be able to confer gifts or minor blessings that could permanently alter a mortal's physical appearance, including causing them to sprout antlers and flowers, making them smell of fresh spices and herbs , or surrounding them with illusory butterflies or dancing shadows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The spirits of deceased Uthgardt chieftains would grant useful charms to those who returned stolen treasures to their barrows.</p>
<p>Sometime prior to the Year of Chilled Marrow, −343 DR , the arcanists of the Netherese enclave of Ythryn devised a magic goblet that bestowed special charms with secondary effects that triggered when the charms expired. They also cultivated special purple pears , eating which could confer charms that granted the ability to cast spells (including cure wounds , druidcraft , faerie fire , greater restoration , invisibility , lesser restoration , lightning bolt , sending , and vicious mockery ).</p>
<p>When the lich Acererak constructed the Tomb of the Nine Gods —a death trap intended to lure and kill adventurers—in the 14 th century DR , he included means for explorers to gain useful charms meant to encourage risky behavior in the dungeon . A century later, his night hag allies—the Sewn Sisters —crafted dolls animated with children's souls which had the ability to grant charms to those who carried them: Clay No-Face 's charm eliminated the need to eat, drink, or breathe for thirty days; Joho 's charm mimicked the power of a helm of comprehending languages for seven days; and Strawbundle 's charm allowed for casting etherealness up to three times.</p>
<p>At some point in the late 15 th century DR, the spymaster known as SEER received a blessing of protection from Savras, and claimed to confer with him when she believed that others were worthy of the same honor.</p>
<p>As of 1492 DR , Jeryth Phaulkon was known to bestow charms of restoration to welcome new members into the Emerald Enclave in Waterdeep , as well as to award charms of heroism to those who achieved great deeds for the faction.</p>
<p>Szass Tam was said to offer charms as part of deals or bargains if he found himself in negotiations.</p>
