<p>The Calling River was the river that flowed through and separated the Grandlore and the Great Forests on the southern part of Ilighôn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Calling River was one of the three waterways that started as waterfalls plummeting from a plateau at the center of Ilighôn, forming mist-covered rivers. The Elder River ran north, passing Archentree , the Springbrook ran west until it emptied into the Springbrook Shallows , and lastly, the Calling River flowed south into the Lake Bluesprings , through it, and culminating in the river mouth delta that fed into the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early ventures, before Ilighôn was settled, the Calling River served as a path for pilgrims who followed Silvanus 's call up to the plateau that later became the Oakenhall , or the House of Silvanus.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the shores of the Calling River were a meeting spot of Shinthala Deepcrest , the Amazon Queen of Ilighôn and a member of the Elder Circle of the Emerald Enclave , and Ashenford Torinbow a druid from Shadowdale . The druids met to discuss the looming danger of undead warlord Borran Kiosk .</p>
