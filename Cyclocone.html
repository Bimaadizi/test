<p>Cyclocones were a type of enchanted hat that radiated a dim evocation dweomer.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These hats were pointed and rather ordinary looking, but had a distinctive design.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Cyclocones were activated by pointing their small end toward the ground and then tossing them forward with a spinning motion. The hat would then begin to rotate at blurring speeds, until it grew into a miniature whirlwind that would move forward in a straight line until a solid, sturdy object caused it to break up.</p>
<p>On average, the whirlwind generated by a cyclocone measured roughly 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide at the base and 15 feet (4.6 meters) wide at the top. Height varied depending upon ceiling height, but they could grow to be as tall as 45 feet (14 meters). Despite their size, these whirlwinds were powerful.</p>
<p>These items were only usable by mages . They were generally one-use only, being destroyed after their whirlwind dissipated, but by 1281 DR one could find cyclocones that had multiple usages and gave their wearer +1 armor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1281 DR , these hats were highly sought after by wizards. However, over time their distinct appearance became a frequent source of mockery from adventurers .</p>
<p>When a mage from Immersea named Bemban grew senile in his older years, he left most of his fortune to private mages in hopes that they would honor his wish to see cyclocones continue continue to be made.</p>
