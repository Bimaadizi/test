<p>Bevis the Illuminator was a scribe and illustrator that lived in Zhentil Keep during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While Bevis was quite skilled at illustrating tomes , he absolutely hated his job. The annoyances of ink stains that covered his hands, the acrid smell of paint and inevitable wrist cramps made his chosen profession insufferable.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He worked as an illuminator for over 15 years, adding artistic depictions to what were otherwise dry and boring texts. He much preferred working on 'penitentials', religious works that depicted scenes of the afterlife to those that were penitent. They gave him opportunity to paint vivid depictions of how he imagined the denizens of the City of Strife in Hades .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bevis was the father of Rinda , an especially skilled scribe of Zhentil Keep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Bevis was hired by the church of Cyric to illustrate a tome that depicted scenes from the Time of Troubles , the year when the gods of Faerûn walked as mortals on Toril . Some time just prior to receiving the book, Bevis had recommended to the church his daughter Rinda work on subsequent drafts.</p>
<p>The book Bevis received was one of the early drafts of the Cyrinishad . Bevis read the entire book, unable to put it down once he began. Afterwards he was by Xeno Mirrormane and Fzoul Chembryl , high-ranking lords of Zhentil Keep. Unfortunately for him, Bevis was not affected by the intended magic within the book and did not believe its contents as irrefutable truth. For that, he was slain by Cyric 's own avatar upon the blade of Godsbane .</p>
<p>After his death, Bevis' soul languished as one of the Burning Men that hung from within Cyric's palace in the City of Strife.</p>
