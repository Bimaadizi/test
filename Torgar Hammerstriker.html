<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Loyalties</h3>
<p>Torgar's loyalty to Mirabar was called into question by the Marchion Elastul Raurym after Bruenor Battlehammer and his party of dwarves visited the city and Torgar was openly consorting with them. Torgar was torn between his long-standing loyalty to Mirabar on the one hand and his loyalty to the dwarven race on the other. This prompted Torgar to consider leaving Mirabar.</p>
<p>His decision to leave for Mithral Hall was sealed when he was, in his view, poorly treated by the Marchion and Agrathan Hardhammer . Not long after departing Mirabar, he was captured by the Hammers and imprisoned on the grounds that he would have given up the city's secrets to Mithral Hall.</p>
<p>In response to Torgar's imprisonment, the dwarves of Mirabar revolted against the human dwellers of the city. Under the advice of Shoudra Stargleam and Agrathan Hardhammer , the dwarven priest of Dumathoin , Marchion Elastul released Torgar. He left soon afterwards with almost 400 dwarves behind him. Torgar and his dwarves later became members of clan Battlehammer and fought with Mithral Hall against the armies of Gerti Orelsdottr and King Obould Many-Arrows .</p>
