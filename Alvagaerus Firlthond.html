<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was taught how to create blast-globes by Isilger Mountrant during the latter's tenure as Magister , between 1221 DR and 1274 DR . Later, he became an apprentice of Manshoon during the initial founding of the Zhentarim ; his chief rival Sememmon mind-reamed the secret of the blast-globes out of him, and slew him.
