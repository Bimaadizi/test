<p>Noanar's Hold was a village, just off the Evermoor Way just on the edge of the High Forest , that grew up around one of the most famous hunting lodges in the North . Cottages and well-kept stables rambled between the trees. One way to reach the village was taking Jundar's Pass south from Calling Horns to Dead Horse Ford , then taking the path east along the banks of the River Dessarin .</p>
