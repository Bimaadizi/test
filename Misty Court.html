<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , on Kythorn 28 , was visited by Tav , an adventuring detective who was investigating a series of grizzly murders. One of the dead bodies was fished out of River Chionthar , wrapped in a tarp taken from one of the workshops on Misty Court. Tav found the open-air stonemason's workshop called Alabaster Stonecrafts . The twins who ran the workshop told the investigator that strange happenings had been plaguing the nearby Cliffside Cemetery , claiming that the gravedigger â€“ Grom Skullsmash , was responsible, or the ghosts .</p>
