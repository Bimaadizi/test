<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Pressured by the refugee crisis, Baldur's Gate closed the Wyrm's Crossing bridge, separating Rivington from other parts of the metropolis and turning it into a refugee tent city. Monifa Diallo, Kimmy's mother, believed the Upper City did not care for the looming danger and possible deaths of everyone in Rivington. However, she did not wish to scare Kimmy.</p>
