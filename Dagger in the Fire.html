<p>Dagger in the Fire was the name given to a special whisky from the town of Tulmene in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The libation was aptly named for its strength. It felt like flames licked the imbiber's throat and it brought tears to the eyes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , Jaxom Lester 's Dagger in the Fire was served at The Fast Sails tavern in Tulmene â€“ a town perched between the Dragon's Neck and Dragon's Head Peninsulas . Despite its chaotic and inconsistent wine list, Dagger in the Fire was a stand out for locals and Volothamp Geddarm , who mentioned the whisky in his guide to Amn and Tethyr. A single glass costed one silver piece .</p>
