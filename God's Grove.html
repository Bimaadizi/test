<h2>Services</h2>
<p>In addition to the worship of Silvanus, the God's Grove had a variety of uses, and every Whelunian knew where it was. It was a popular spot for picnics and weddings, and children were always welcome to play there. People also took injured and sick animals to Orlenstar for his ministration. Orlenstar also kept a constant store of healing goodberries , as well as his homebrew spruce beer .</p>
<p>Although Orlenstar was officially caretaker of the shrine and grove, many Whelunians also pitched in to maintain and beautify the site, since it was so important to them.</p>
