<p>Vergadain ( pronounced : /ˈ v ɜːr g ə d ɑː ɪ n / VUR-guh-dain ) was the neutral dwarven deity of luck, trickery, negotiation and wealth, and for a time an exarch of Moradin . While it seemed the Merchant King represented the dwarves' well-known dedication to the mercantile art of bargaining, those who knew better were aware that he had an aspect that seldom filled the more legal-minded dwarves with pride. As such, The Laughing Dwarf , as he was called by non-dwarves, also watched over those dwarves who used less-than-legal means to gain wealth. Regardless of how he was viewed, Vergadain delighted in the art of the deal, no matter what it was, so long as it turned a profit.</p>
<p>Vergadain also represented the god Bes in the Realms, thus becoming the god of chance and luck within the Mulhorandi pantheon . In the later 14th century, worship of this aspect, the so-called Short Father , had declined to the point where only a few merchants in Skuld still prayed to him.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Few admitted to following Vergadain in knowledgeable society, but those who did were known as hurndor , or "those who trade". The hurndor were dedicated to furthering dwarven commerce, having traveled Faerûn farther than the priests of any member of the Morndinsamman with the exception of Marthammor Duin .</p>
<p>Clerics of Vergadain were expected to be personally wealthy, while also ensuring that some of their wealth was dedicated to keeping the local temple filled with treasure. Holy days of Vergadain's faith were known as coin festivals (also jokingly referred to as trademeets by humans ), marking a period of immense mercantile activity. These occurred on the days before and after a full moon, on Greengrass and on any day declared favorable by the Merchant Prince.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Vergadain was very popular among the Morndinsamman, while sharing a particularly strong friendship with Dugmaren Brightmantle , as they shared an interest in mischief. He also occasionally partnered with Abbathor , a relationship that they both would have described as a "business arrangement". After traveling throughout Faerûn, Vergadain had also gained many allies among the non-dwarf mercantine deities.</p>
