<p>Ivus Barbarak was the proprietor of the Holdfast Inn of Liam's Hold in the late-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ivus Barbarak was a charismatic man with exquisitely-groomed facial hair. His body language and facial expressions were that of a man who've seen everything, several times. His affable personality was accentuated by Ivus's love of puns.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ivus Barbarak's cousin Aldernar was a member of Amnian navy who sent the owner of the Holdfast Inn a curious giant nautilus shell from the Moonshae Isles . However, Ivus suspected that Aldernar simply bought it as a cheap trinket in the Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ivus was the face of the Holdfast Inn. He handled the front-office part of the business, while his beloved wife, a half-dwarf Nuli Barbarak , handled the kitchen and back-end. In 1372 DR Ivus managed to hire a renowned musical guest from the city of Waterdeep - Evani and her fantastical Fantabulizer. The innkeep was beside himself in joy of hosting such a guest. During the same time, the Holdfast Inn welcomed the adventurer known as the Hero of Daggerford who aided the hamlet's disappearing cattle and graciously delivered a keg of finest ale to an eccentric resident of the town - Rab Bitnez .</p>
