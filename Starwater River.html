<p>The Starwater River was a river in Cormyr . It flowed south from the Storm Horns mountain range, through the King's Forest , to the Dragonmere . The city of Marsember was situated on the western bank of the mouth of the river.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Starwater carved the land into a gorge just north of the town of Eveningstar , where it cut through the Stonecliff .</p>
<p>The river was populated by treacherous sandbars, which made it dangerous to those who were not familiar with them.</p>
<p>The most southerly rapids were in Redhand Pool in Eveningstar , although boats needed to be fairly narrow to navigate the Mouth o' Gargoyles .</p>
