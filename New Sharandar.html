<p>New Sharandar was a settlement of elves and eladrin that straddled two realms, one on Toril and the other in the Feywild , on either side of an extra-planar portal . It was the home to the descendants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn , offering them protection from the malevolent forces of the dark fey .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On the continent of Faerûn , New Sharandar took root in the remains of Sharandar, the capital of the elven survivor state Iliyanbruen from which it drew its name. Although they lay in ruin, the magnificent buildings of Old Sharandar featured ornate architecture and decoration.</p>
<p>Within the Feywild, New Sharandar took the form of utilitarian wooden structures and outposts set within the boughs of the plane's massive trees.</p>
<p>On the side in the Neverwinter Wood, the Fey Crossing that connected the two instances of New Sharandar resembled a gaping hole in the center of a gigantic oak tree. While peering through the passageway only shows the other side of the tree, stepping through the hole leads directly into the courtyard of the New Sharandar in the Feywild.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Due its unique formation in both the Prime and Feywild, New Sharandar had two geographical location. In Faerûn , it existed in the ruins of Old Sharandar, within the Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North . Within the Feywild, New Sharandar was located within a region of the Feywild beneath the fey temple called the Arcane Reservoir .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the bi-planar settlement was led by the fey knight , Merrisara Winterwhite .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The outpost of New Sharandar was protected by several forward observation camps established by the Iliyanbruen elves. These posts allowed them to take note of incoming threats from further out into the Feywild.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Millenia before the Era of Upheaval , the great elven kingdom of Illefarn stood as the home of the Tel-quessir in the North. It remained strong until the −1100 DR , when its last coronal called for a Retreat to Evermeet , and it was divided into three smaller realms, Ardeep , Rilithar , and Iliyanbruen in the Neverwinter Wood.</p>
<p>Iliyanbruen continued on for nearly 1300 years, until it too fell to ruin by the Year of the Troublesome Vixen, 177 DR . Only a few scattered elven settlements remained within the forest, along with the ruins of Sharandar , its capital city. Many of those who left Faerûn traveled to the Feywild to continue on the traditions of the Iliyanbruen elves and Eladrin.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague fractured the foundations of existence on Toril, in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the barriers between the planet in the Prime and the Feywild were weakened. Over time, the elven and eladrin descendants of Iliyanbruen uncovered a portal that connected the Neverwinter Wood to their ancestral home in the Feywild. They formed a new home for themselves, with fortifications on both sides of the portal , called New Sharandar, in honor of the capital of their lost home.</p>
<p>After claiming their new home, many elves set out to restore the lost settlements of Iliyanbruen and repair the ruins of Old Sharandar. Not all of the fey were so committed to peaceful endeavors however. In the years leading up to the 1480s DR, the elves and eladrin launched a campaign against the dark fey that desecrated and took their region of the Feywild.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the fomorian king Malabog threatened their home when he waged war upon New Sharandar, from his castle in the Feydark . Led by Merrisara Winterwhite, the fey of New Sharandar responded with swift action of their own, sieging the giant-king's castle and slaying the malevolent monarch with the aid of the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge in Neverwinter.</p>
<p>Over the following decade, the three hags of the Odious Court began to work against the fey of New Sharandar to claim the Arcane Reservoir for their own use. They manipulated the remnants of Malabog's army to serve their ends and each claimed a territory in the Feywild that threatened New Sharandar's mere existence.</p>
