<p>Jopi was a man who lived on the Sword Coast during the midâˆ’14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jopi was a human man with a light skin tone and brown hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a rather famous uncle who lived in Baldur's Gate , the mage known as Ragefast . When he was young, Jopi would affectionately refer to his uncle as Grumpleskin, often provoking the casting of a non-harmful spell in response.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Jopi made a trip along the Coast Way to visit his uncle at his home in the city. His journey took longer than expected due to the increased bandit activity that sprang up during the Iron crisis of that year. He made a stopover at the Friendly Arm inn to briefly avoid the perils of travel on the coast.</p>
