<p>Thalarmol's was a business in Kholtar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Thalarmol's was located on the south side of Hael Way between Halamor's Sure Service and Elduskryn's Fiery Creations , not far from Farrgaunlar (the southern gate out of Kholtar). Across the street was a klathlaaedin (fancy mansion) named Anthormbrur belonging to the Horthander family.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Thalarmol's made generic and custom crates for shipping goods so they would withstand travel by caravan. They were in an advantageous location with Halamor's next door, as customers used the delivery service to send items to Thalarmol's.</p>
