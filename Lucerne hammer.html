<p>Lucerne hammers were a type of polearm in the Realms that had an infamous reputation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At a glance, this weapon bore a resemblance to a bec de corbin or military picks . Lucerne hammers had long poles, reaching as long as 10 feet (3 meters) in length. These were mounted with a small, clawed three or four-pronged hammer head and sporting an awl spike that was longer than that of a bec de corbin.</p>
<p>It was not uncommon for the whole weapon to be forged of steel , often gilded with precious metals or decorated with carvings.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The lucerne hammer was rather heavy and slow to move. They were designed to pierce heavy armor, but were also sometimes used to dismount enemies. The awl spike, rather than being used to pierce armor, was meant to keep enemies at bay.</p>
