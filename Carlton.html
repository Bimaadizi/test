Unfortunately, the young lady evaded his escort, delaying the Wave Wyvern's departure.</p>
<p>When it became apparent that Lady Elisa Seasilver was aboard the vessel when it was captured by shades , Carlton and his men joined Arietta, under the guise of Lady Emmeline, aboard the Lonely Roamer to rescue the abducted noblewoman.</p>
