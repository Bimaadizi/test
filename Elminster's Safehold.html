<p>Elminster's Hideaway , or Elminster's Safehold (known by Elminster as simply Safehold ) was a refuge or safehold of Elminster's, hidden close to the center of Coliar in Realmspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From outside, the Hideaway resembled nothing so much as a giant sphere of shiny metal that reflected all light. It was about 250 feet (76 meters) in diameter.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Those who got through the sphere landed in the safehold itself, an extradimensional eight-sided room with a ceiling 20 feet (6.1 meters) up. There was a bed inside, and doors on every other wall. Shelves held thousands of books and potions , including Elminster's spellbooks and Lhaeo 's finished works.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>As the dimension was somehow in contact with the metal sphere, it got very hot; Elminster had installed a nonmagical item that blew in cool air through a grate. The grate itself had half of its label missing, but the remaining half read "...aire".</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Anyone casting detect magic would notice a message, definitely not in Elminster's handwriting, across the sphere, reading "Notify next of kin before trespassing".</p>
<p>There were rumors of spectators and iron golems inside the safehold as of 1358 DR , but in-depth sources made no mention of such guardians in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Entry</h2>
<p>Most access was by Elminster through his spell, Elminster's evasion , but it was possible to enter as well by touching the surface of the sphere while wearing a magical ring whose only magical power was having "Elminster" written on the inside, and making not a sound.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster created the sphere about 1000 years prior to 1367 DR , to better monitor the actions of Firebrand Flametongue , a red dragon who'd retired to Coliar . After 100 years, Elminster confirmed Firebrand Flametongue was indeed retiring, and repurposed the pocket universe into a dimensional intersection.</p>
<p>However, more precise sages insisted the safehold was not created by Elminster, but by someone prior, and only given to him by Azuth .</p>
<p>Per some sages, only Ao had been to this place.</p>
<h2>Gates</h2>
<p>The safehold held four gates. One of them was to the temple of Mystra in Evermeet , another to Elminster's Castle, and the last two led to Earth : one to Yellowstone National Park in 1869 AD, and one to Ed Greenwood 's house in 1991 AD as of 1367 DR .</p>
