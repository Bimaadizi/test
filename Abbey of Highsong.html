<p>The Abbey of Highsong was a temple to Milil located northwest of the town of Nashkel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The temple was built by the Sorlyn priest Velmos Sonder after he acquired Wythyndle's Round Book , circa 1360 DR . It was built in an old country villa that once belonged to the Tharthyn family.</p>
<p>The abbey began to flourish a couple years after its opening, attracting many wealthy young folks from Amn and Baldur's Gate . It was the last known location of the Round Book that disappeared three years after the place's opening, seemingly stolen during Velmos' assassination.</p>
