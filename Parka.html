<p>Parkas was clothing used to keep warm in cold climates.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A parka was a practical garment that consisted of a one-piece jacket and hood designed to be slipped over the head like a sweater. It extended just below the waist for optimal coverage. The interior was lined with seal skin, providing insulation, while the outer layer was made of fur. The hood had a rounded shape and hung loosely over the head without covering the face intentionally. This design prevented excessive frost formation where the fur met the flesh. Although a lightly powdered frost occasionally formed on an uncovered face, it was easily brushed away. Conversely, completely covering the face lead to the formation of a layer of hard ice.</p>
<p>A parka's sleeves were long and wide, allowing the wearer to draw cold hands inside and warm them against the chest. This feature provided a practical solution for warming chilly hands in cold weather conditions. A parka could keep its wearer warm up to −20 ℉ (−29 ℃ ).</p>
<p>The thick hide of a krotter could be used to craft parkas.</p>
