<h2>Structure</h2>

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Fatted Bookworm was owned by Velara Lillianyth , a human mage . Velara’s reputation ensured steady business, regardless of the presence of her occasional shop clerk, Amryyr Yauntyrr . Amryyr, a drow wizard and thief , utilized the shop as a base when in Skullport, dealing in rare texts, trading valuable information, and facilitating discreet item transfers between Skullport and other parts of the Underdark . Velara, who outwardly expressed little interest in Amryyr’s activities, allowed him to operate within her shop due to an obligation to his associate, Malakuth Tabuirr , a drow slaver . When Amryyr was present, the Fatted Bookworm occasionally handled highly coveted items, including rare magical texts, arcane scrolls, and, on rare occasions, spellbooks .</p>
