<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Narux lived in a cave on the northeast side of the Circle of Thunder, and had few possessions save for those his fellow anchorites also shared, such as a pet boar. However, at some point he managed to acquire an enchanted shield , which he hid inside his cave by burying it beneath the floor.</p>
