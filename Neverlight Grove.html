<p>The Neverlight Grove was a myconid community in the Northdark . Its isolation permitted the myconids to live in peace until the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Neverlight Grove was led by the myconid sovereign Phylo for a long time.</p>
<p>Circa 1484 DR , fellow sovereign Basidia led its colony to the Grove and assumed co-leadership of the community. Two years later, the demon lord Zuggtmoy considered the Neverlight Grove to be perfect for her headquarters on Toril and corrupted Phylo. With its help, Zuggtmoy slowly corrupted most of the myconids.</p>
