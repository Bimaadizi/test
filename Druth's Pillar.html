<p>Druth's Pillar was a hollow pillar in the Haunted Wing of Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pillar had the appearance of three pillars fused together. Also, it could swing wide open, revealing a hollow space. It was the only pillar of its design in the whole haunted wing of Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The triple pillar was once the endpost of War Wizard Jereth Ardruth 's closet.</p>
<p>In 1479Â DR , the death knight Targrael , once a highknight of Cormyr , had sought the pillar under the belief that Jorunhast may have hidden Salember Obarskyr 's "marcher in blue flame", which she believed may be a blueflame item , in there, based on a note unearthed by five sages working in the palace basements, poring over old records. Those mages were Loagranboydar , Orkrash , Garendor , Wyshbryn , and Argrant .</p>
<p>Targrael was also aware of a note from Palaghard to a lover, making an oblique reference that the pillar, "Druth's Pillar" to him, could be opened to reveal a space big enough to hide in. While heading for the pillar, she was attacked by the ghost of the ancient regent, Alusair Obarskyr , before reaching it.</p>
