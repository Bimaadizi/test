<p>A robe of scintillating colors was an enchanted garment whose colors constantly shifted.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In order for the magic of these robes to function the wearer had to possess sufficient intelligence and wisdom. The robe would shift colors and patterns with mesmerizing hues. This shed light within a 40 ft (12 m) sphere around the robe and could even hypnotize any potential enemies so they would stare helplessly at the robe's display. Enemies able to resist the robe's hypnotic effect still found it more difficult to hit the wearer because of the dizzying display. Some versions of robes of scintillating colors also allowed the wearer to displace themselves once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Robe of scintillating colors were believed to originate from the kingdom of Halruaa , created by a Lliira -worshiper Persephenon . Rare among fellow Halruaan wizards, Persephenon possessed the gift of sorcery . This talent, his eccentric personality, and veneration of the Joybringer goddess led to societal stigma among the kingdom's wizards. Despite being a pariah, Persephenon eventually worked his way to the position of a skyship captain. Thankful for the opportunity, Persephenon created the first robe of scintillating colors as a tribute to his deity to paint rainbows as he traversed the skies.</p>
<p>This display of flamboyancy eventually cost Persephenon respect and resulted in his exile from Halruaa. However, the scintillating sorcerer was welcomed by open-minded halfling of Luiren , where he found a new home and started creating copies of the colorful robes that once cost him so much.</p>
