<p>The Akashnu Mountains stood in the land of Malatra in Kara-Tur and were the birthplace of the Kuong Kingdom .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains towered 6000–7000 feet (1.8–2.1 kilometers) over the jungles of Malatra. They had very rough terrain and rocky peaks, with a number of valleys between the ridges.</p>
<p>The range was rich in gems and precious metals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Akashnu Mountains were where the Kuong Kingdom arose, founded by Vishnan I with its priest-kings ruling from the capital city of Suranatra. From the outset, it was an aggressive and theocratic empire. Thanks to the precious metals and stones found in the Akashnu Mountains, the rich and puissant priest-kings of Suranatra expanded their dominion to the Kunong River and to the coast.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, to better administrate this greater territory, the priest-kings were forced to relocate their capital to Parmahana . The city and parts of the mountains were abandoned.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR , the safe trails had been lost and the little-used roads through the mountains were hazardous. Most travelers stayed near the Srelanat Road .</p>
<p>Those who lived in the mountains dwelt primarily in the valleys between the ridges.</p>
<p>In the southern foothills lay the ruins of Suranatra , the former capital of the Kuong Kingdom.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, the Kuong still mined gems in the Akashnu Mountains, bringing wealth to the kingdom.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the mountains were home to korobokuru and to bandits. Wanderers and criminals used the ruins of Suranatra as a place to hide.</p>
