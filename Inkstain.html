<p>Forgemaster Inkstain was a dwarf printer based in Procampur in the Vast in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s DR, he had a shop on Scribes' Alley in the Merchant District of Procampur, though it was little more than a lean-to against a teamster 's stable. There, he had a printing press , a recent invention that he'd shipped from Dwarves' Deep . From his shop, he printed cheap and low-quality pamphlets, handbills, and flyers. Perhaps surprisingly for a dwarf, he had an ogre apprentice named Aguul .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He originally came from Dwarves' Deep, but later moved to Procampur.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , the lama Koja of Khazari visited Inkstain to discuss printing his new book, A History of the Tuigan . However, Inkstain quoted a price of 10,000 gold lions for just one copy, and 500 lions for extras, which Koja was unable to pay or raise the money for. Fortunately, the god Deneir later appeared to Koja and granted him gems worth at least 10,000 gold pieces to pay for the costs of printing, so Koja planned to have his book printed by Inkstain the next day.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Inkstain was named for his appearance, as he was covered all over with ink stains. His beard might have been white, but was gray with ink. He was cantankerous when working, often yelling at Aguul, but was polite to customers.</p>
