<p>Handful was Dragonbait 's and Copperbloom 's the oldest hatchling. He was a finhead saurial and was born in the mid-14 th century DR in the Lost Vale of the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Growing up, Handful was, as his given name implied, quite a handful. He was a lot like his father, the heroic paladin Dragonbait. When meeting strangers, Handful was formal and polite.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Handful was born after Dragonbait rescued his tribe from under Moander 's clutches in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR and was already a growing child by the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . Tarkhaldale was often visited by Finder Wyvernspur , the savior of the saurials, in the guise of an aged priest Jedidiah . Copperbloom treated him with respect, but Handful had a polite but snarky attitude towards Finder, just like his father, Dragonbait did. Handful liked to tease Finder, suggesting him to take on the guise of the deity Lathander instead of the guise of an old priest. When Finder accompanied a group of his allies to the Lost Vale, Handful took a liking to Holly Harrowslough , a paladin. The two engaged in a mock sword combat using sticks and Hadful eagerly served as Holly's tour guide around the village.</p>
