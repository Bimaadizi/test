<p>Hahlomede Teeos , often referred to as Blackwyrm , was one of the eight members of the First Zulkirate and a Zulkir of Abjuration in 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hahlomede Teeos was a Thayan human male, like most zulkirs at the time. He built an aura of mystery about himself, something he truly enjoyed. He was never seen wearing anything but his tattered black robes and cloaks , which were enchanted to protect against dragons and make the wyrms actively avoid the wizard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hahlomede became the first member of the Council of Zulkirs from the school of abjuration magic in the autumn of the Year of Warlords, 1030 DR . The council was assembled under the diviner lich Ythazz Buvaar . The title allowed Hahlomede to select the tharchions and gave him absolute control over a sliver of Thay. When he was not scheming or governing, the new Zulkir of Abjuration liked to track down lost treasures and ancient magic and weaved complex and cunning deceptions, which made him disliked by his peers. His reputation turned even sourer, to being feared and hated, after he became the investigator of the First Zulkirate.</p>
<p>The wizard's reign as the Zullkir of Abjuration came to an end some time before the late Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR .</p>
