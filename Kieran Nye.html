<p>Kieran Nye was a wizard owner of The Whistling Gallows inn of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kieran was a light-skinned human man with graying hair, and he preferred to wear teal mage's robes . He spoke with a typical southern Tethyrean accent.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The evidence of Kieran's past was hidden within a mage laboratory behind a mirror in his room on the inn's first floor. That was where he kept his expansive collection of enchanted curios. Kieran was willing to sell and trade in magical trinkets with those who discovered his Arcane Brotherhood past as a bribe to keep that secret.</p>
<p>Kieran's collection of magical devices was quite expansive. It included a number of spell scrolls , a scarlet/blue ioun stone , Jamison's sling , Xainlaphar's flying skull , Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts , the Dagger of Safe Harbor , and Thrym extract bottles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kieran Nye was an old Tethyrean wizard who, at one point, was a member of the organization that would eventually be known as the Host Tower of the Arcane . Kieran deserted, and the Host Tower wanted him dead, so he kept his past affiliation a secret.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , he purchased the Whistling Gallows inn after Skeld , the original proprietor, died.</p>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Kieran's great-granddaughter, Kiera Nye was running The Whistling Gallows.</p>
