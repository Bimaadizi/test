<p>"The krakentua" was a krakentua who posed as the goddess of the village of Shinkintin on the Fochu Peninsula of Wa in the midâ€“14th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several centuries before, she was attacked and defeated by Za-Jikku , a pan lung dragon and rogue officer of the Celestial Bureaucracy who caused much destruction in Kara-Tur . Za-Jikku also took one of her tentacles, which had been severed during the fight. The krakentua could not find her way to Qui to recover the valuable member.</p>
<p>Later, around Wa Year 1765 (1347 DR) , the krakentua had a titanic battle with more powerful spirits of the ocean. Badly wounded, she escaped to the Isle of Gargantuas to heal and recuperate.</p>
<p>Around Wa Year 1776 (1358 DR) , she left the Isle and went to the Fochu Peninsula, seeking humans to worship her. There she enslaved the village of Shinkintin , where the shoya , a powerful wu jen transformed a stream to flow with cherry tree milk for her. But a rebellion quickly emerged and the krakentua destroyed the village. The surviving villagers offered their total devotion. They paid homage and tribute to "the lady of the ocean" when she visited their refugee camp on the beach twice a month.</p>
<p>After six months, in 1776, if Osari Minhiro and his foreign adventuring party discovered Shinkintin and stayed to see her, she would offer her help against Za-Jikku, but not before testing them through a series of dangerous dreams.</p>
