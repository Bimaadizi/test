<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , when General Batu Min Ho met Yamun Khahan to offer his services, he gifted him and his men with a hundred casks of quality plum wine from Ch'ing Tung. He offered a toast to the Khahan, though the Tuigan feared it was poisoned, so Yamun had Batu drink first. Chanar Ong Kho scoffed at the idea of wine made from plums and Yamun found it sweeter than the wine the Tuigan were used to.</p>
