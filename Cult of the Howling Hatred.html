<p>The Cult of the Howling Hatred was a cult devoted to Yan-C-Bin and one of the four cults responsible for the Elemental Evil crisis.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Cult of the Howling Hatred gathered all air cultists. They were fascinated by the destructive power of wind and storms, and saw themselves as agents of elemental air , with the mission of punishing those who had wronged against the skies. Unlike the members of the other elemental cults, many Howling Hatred cultists used their new elemental powers only as instruments for a purpose. They never destroyed things without having a purpose, but rather they did so while pursuing an objective, such as expressing their personal freedom or to obtain things.</p>
<p>The Cult of the Howling Hatred recruited from among those who dealt in perceptions over facts: illusionists, spies, and assassins, for example. Predatory or fierce winged creatures of any kind, even non-sentient monsters usually too stupid and ravenous to be trained, tolerated and even submitted to the cultists. Hippogriffs , griffons , and giant vultures were frequently used as air cult steeds.</p>
<h2>Tactics and Philosophy</h2>
<p>Howling Hatred cultists' main personality traits were being clever, impulsive, and creative. They considered themselves as smarter, quicker, and more capable than any others they met. Air cultists disliked open battle. Their usual strategy was to work in secret advancing their plots with stealth and illusion and hitting their enemies with force only when they had to.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The start of the modern air cult was when Aerisi Kalinoth recovered one of the four elemental weapons crafted centuries before by the drow archmage and Elder Elemental Eye cultist Vizeran De Vir .</p>
<p>All their work culminated in 1491 DR at the Fane of the Eye , under the ruined dwarven city of Tyar-Besil . Working simultaneously with the other three elemental cults, the air cultists tried to summon Yan-C-Bin to Toril using members of a missing diplomatic delegation from Mirabar and other captives as sacrifices.</p>
