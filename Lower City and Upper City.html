<p>Lower City and Upper City was a guide book written to familiarize newcomers of the Upper City and the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , published sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The volume described the main difference between the two parts of the city – the Upper City was the home of the Baldurian nobility or the patriars . The Upper City was protected by regular Flaming Fist patrols and well-lit streets and was notable for its wealth and beautifully decorated buildings. In comparison, the book described the Lower City as the polar opposite – a rarely-patrolled collection of narrow, chaotic streets, tightly-built homes inhabited by merchants, traders, crafters, entertainers, criminals, thieves, coinlassess , bartenders, and "knights and knaves."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , copies of Lower City and Upper City were found across the city, and one tome was kept in the printing basement of the Baldur's Mouth in the Lower City.</p>
