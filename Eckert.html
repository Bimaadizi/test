<p>Eckert used to be the valet of Talbot Uskevren until he betrayed him and the other Uskevrens in exchange for the life of his daughter, Maelin , who was being kept by Radu and Stannis Malveen . When he outlived his usefulness, Radu nearly slew Eckert, but the man was saved by Feena Archwood , who managed to heal him in time. He was later dismissed by Talbot, who showed Eckert sympathy by not having him jailed.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>In The Halls of Stormweather , Eckert's name was spelled both Eckart and Eckert several times, but Eckert was used exclusively in Black Wolf .</p>
