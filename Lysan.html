<p>Lysan , the Hand of Auril , was a manipulative cleric and a Chosen of Auril in Icewind Dale in the late 13 th century DR , who was returned to life in service of the Frostmaiden in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lysan was a blond woman who typically wore blue clothing with ice-colored edges. She was considered to be quite a beauty and had blue eyes, as blue as a glacier.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lysan was a cleric of seemingly low power. She somehow cursed the entire Vale of Shadows and raised the dead as shadows to scare the people of Kuldahar . She believed that it was the power of the goddess Auril herself that was within her. According to Kontik, a follower of Auril sent to assassinate the party responsible for Lysan's death, Lysan was a Chosen of Auril.</p>
<p>While enforcing Auril's will, Lysan commanded the creatures of cold, such as yetis .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lysan was known to possess an enchanted cloak named the Mantle of the Coming Storm . She also possessed scrolls of cure serious wounds , cure critical wounds , and protection from fire . In 1373 DR , Lysan still wore her original, or possibly a copy of the Mantle of the Coming Storm atop the Winter King's Plate armor . She wielded the enchanted whip called Winter's Regard and carried a massive tower shield of missile protection .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , her primary mission was to open the tomb of the barbarian king Kresselack to the cold winds and cleanse out the light and sources of warmth within that tomb. To do so, she infiltrated the society of Kuldahar, acting as a waitress at the local tavern Root Cellar . She spread stories convincing the people of Kuldahar, including the wise Archdruid Arundel , that there was a threat within the Vale of Shadows were Kresselack was entombed.</p>
<p>Adventurers were recruited by Arundel to investigate the Vale of Shadows. They eventually slew all the undead guardians of Kresselack's tomb, making it possible for Lysan to carry out her mission. The risen Kresselack recruited the party to slay Lysan; afterwards, he told the party that there was no one threatening Kuldahar in the Vale.</p>
<p>Despite Lysan's death, her service to Auril was not over yet. The Frostmaiden resurrected Lysan a century later, boosting the slain Chosen's powers with portion of the goddess's divinity. In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Auril commanded Lysan to found the Temple of Arctus in the Reghed Glacier , atop her godling son's prison, and join forces with the growing army of Iceblood , that was to free Arctus the Walking Winter from its ancient prison to lay waste to Icewind Dale. Lysan's orders were to shepherd the goddess' wayward progeny. To Lysan's disdain, Iceblood was chosen by Arctus to lead its army into battle against the Ten Towns and after that further south, though she believed that that role was hers by right. But just in time for Arctus' release from the lacier prison, the famed Hero of Neverwinter and their allies made way to the Temple of Arctus's inner sanctum where they clashed with Lysan, defeating her.</p>
