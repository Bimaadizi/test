<p>Fiendish grafts were body parts of fiends that were attached to the bodies of other corporeal creatures or people.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These grafts were inherently malevolent, and having one would twist a person's the personality as well as their appearance. Recipients of such grafts found themselves either tempted toward committing evil acts or being driven mad if such urges conflicted with their goodly nature. These changes made them noticeably less trustworthy to nonevil beings. Despite this, fiendish grafts were technically not magical , nor did they have sentience. They could not generally be salvaged from the creatures to whom they were attached.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>Only fiends possessed the knowledge of how to create and attach such grafts, and they were generally bestowed onto a creature at the climax of a dark ritual . In general, melding fiends' body parts onto another creature required familiarity with medicine, specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh, and often access to one or more relevant spells . Two known exceptions to these rules inluded fiends of corruption —who had the power to freely bestow grafts as rewards or temptations for mortals whom they were trying to corrupt or tempt into infernal contracts —and sibriexes —who could conjure grafts from Abyssal chaos and instantly meld one onto a willing recipient or even force one onto a helpless victim.</p>
<p>There were also said to exist magical devices that a creature could fit inside and which would remove and replace limbs in exceedingly painful—and potentially fatal—procedures.</p>
