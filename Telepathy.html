<p>Telepathy was a general term for abilities of variously magical , psionic , or supernatural nature that enabled intelligent creatures to send and receive thoughts to another, allowing for mental communication without words.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Generally, a creature had to possess knowledge of at least a single language in order to use telepathy, but did not need to share a language with creatures they telepathically communicated with. But some creatures possessed more limited forms of telepathy. "Limited telepathy" could refer to telepathy that was limited to members of one's own species, telepathy limited by shared language, telepathy that was one-way communication, or only being able to telepathically communicate images, emotions, and simple ideas.</p>
<p>In some cases, telepathy manifested as a narrow link between a servitor creature or object and their master. This was exhibited by darkenbeasts , familiars , the spirits summoned with find steed , the animal companions gained with find companion , grandfather plaques , homunculi , imps , incarnates , psicrystals , quasits , serpentine owls , vizier's turbans , and the Copper Demon of Tros trapped within the Acorn of Wo Mai .</p>
<p>Most forms of telepathy didn't require being within eyesight of a target to initiate telepathic communication, though there was a maximum effective range and if either party strayed from it the connection would be severed. This range varied depending upon the creature, though in many cases was around 100 feet (30 meters). Telepathic communication would also be severed if a creature was incapacitated or in some cases, contacted a different mind, as telepathy was usually limited to one or two-way communication with a single target. While it was possible for some to telepathically communicate with multiple targets, it was quite the difficult feat.</p>
<p>Those who lacked access to telepathy by any means could readily receive and respond to telepathic messages, but were incapable of terminating communication. By contrast, those with telepathy could end a telepathic contact at any time.</p>
<h3>Protection</h3>
<p>There were a number of methods one could employ to either guard themselves against any attempts at telepathic communication or to outright incapacitate a creature's telepathic abilities. For spellcasters, spells that protected against mental-based effects could be used for this purpose, such as cloak of insanity or impervious sanctity of mind . To outright make magical forms of communication like telepathy impossible, one could cast spiral of degeneration , a quest spell which created a magic debilitating area of effect. For psionics users, the four psionic defense modes would be relied upon to protect against unwanted contact with their minds – mental barrier , mind bar , mind blank , and tower of iron will .</p>
<p>In terms of magical items , dust of dullness could temporarily disable any sort of "sixth sense", whilst the knave's eye patch blocked unwanted telepathic communication. In terms of specific lifepaths that carried the benefit of warding off telepathy, expert masterminds honed their mental fortitude to the point where it could not be unwillingly pierced by telepathic communications. And proficiently skilled warlocks of a Great Old One pact had their thoughts shielded against telepathy.</p>
<p>With the Blood War being waged between two telepathic groups, the archdevils of Baator outfitted their flying fortresses with devices that allowed one to disrupt all telepathic communication within a 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) radius.</p>
<h3>Subtypes</h3>
<h2>Telepathy Granters</h2>
<p>There were a variety of powers, spells, and items across the Realms that could grant telepathy to those who lacked the ability:</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<h2>Telepathic Objects</h2>
<p>Most sapient magical items, referred to as " sentient items ", had the ability to speak telepathically, as did many psionic items and some items that were imbued with sentience by the spell life force transfer , though some sentient items were limited to empathic communication. Even magical traps could be imbued with intelligence and the ability to speak empathically or telepathically. And in a rare example of an entire building bestowed sapience and telepathy, there was the Undying Temple of Kiaransalee .</p>
<p>About 30% of psionic items were found to telepathically utter some sort of mental "noise", either when unsheathed, when they drew first blood, or when they were used to kill an enemy. This "noise" varied quite a bit, in some cases being crooning or screams and in other cases recitations of battle poems.</p>
