<p>Vehlarr was a city named after its creator, the werewolf Vehlarr , who united the werewolf packs of the Wood of Sharp Teeth into a single nation. The city was the site of the Circle of Vehlarr , a magic portal into the city of Myth Lharast , until the deity Sel√ªne destroyed both cities in 720 DR , after being angered by the warfare between them.</p>
<h2>Rumours</h2>
<p>It is rumoured that Vehlarr was not destroyed and still exists on another ageless plane. On nights of a full moon, the city is supposed to return to Abeir-Toril and it supposedly accessible through the Circle of Vehlarr . The rumour has never been substantiated.</p>
