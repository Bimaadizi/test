<p>The Fist of the Future was a fortress in the city of Hill's Edge that was converted to a temple in the name of Cyric during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The exterior of the temple-fortress was adorned with massive black banners bearing the holy symbol of Cyric, the Dark Sun.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>High Dark Priestess Emana Gortho used resources from the Zhentarim to attract many deranged, unscrupulous, or otherwise down-and-out individuals to join the ranks of Cyric's faithful. She directed them to amass weapons of war for a planned assault against the Cry of Joy , the local temple to Lliira , with the ultimate goal of taking control of the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , the Cyricists' plans to destroy the Lliiran temple had been repeatedly thwarted, presumably by local Harper agents.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Within a short time after its founding, the temple attracted hundreds of individuals to the Cyricist faith. As congregations went, they were self-serving and wholly undisciplined, but ultimately very dangerous.</p>
