<p>The nation of Sossal ( pronounced : /ˈ s ɔː s ɑː l / SAW-sall ) was located in the Cold Lands of northeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This chilly place was locked between Pelvuria and Yal Tengri .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>From its founding in 331 DR to 1319 DR the nation of Sossal was ruled under a system of monarchy. Following the death of its then-leader at that latter date, the nation was ruled by a druid conclave known as the Circle of the Frozen Sun .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Due to how remote it was, the land of Sossal had very little contact with the rest of Faerûn outside of trade. Sossal's only known trade city was Naupau , a port on the shores of the Yal Tengri . The sailors of Sossal were rumored to know of a secret passage through the ice pack northwest from the Yal Tengri to the Trackless Sea , and tales were told of strange ships matching their description sailing as far south as Calimshan .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa -2320 DR , a clan of Rashemi migrated north and settled in the alpine valleys of the Armridge Mountains . Over time, their descendants would come to be known as the Sossrim .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Clashes, 331 DR , the Sossrim living around the Great Glacier were united by Ylaethar "The Bear" , who proclaimed himself to be Ornath (king). He went on lead the Sossrim south from their ancestral lands and founded the nation of Sossal.</p>
<p>At the height of the Raumathar Empire's power, they briefly ruled over land of Sossal.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Breaking Ice, 991 DR , the land of Sossal was rocked by a series of earthquakes. These tremors opened fissures in the nearby Great Glacier and several powerful demons that had been trapped below since the fall of Narfell were unleashed. Under the guidance of then-ruler Londraeth , the kingdom managed to vanquish the rampaging horde.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Fallen Throne, 1319 DR , the monarchy of Sossal collapsed when then-leader Thelessar was murdered by his twin sons Norlith and Baldraeth . Both were banished from Sossal for this transgression by the nation's spiritual leader, the Great Druid Ulthorkh . He and his druid conclave, the Circle of the Frozen Sun, would soon after take over the role of governing the nation.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Dabron Sashenstar of Baldur's Gate embarked on a voyage to Sossal. He would later return with a hauberk from the land, which would go on display within the Hall of Exploration in the House of the Moon .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, Sossal remained an isolated nation, both in terms of location and diplomacy.</p>
