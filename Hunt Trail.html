<p>The Hunt Trail ran through the Vast , connecting the towns of Ylraphon and Kurth .</p>
<p>From west to east, it began at Ylraphon, passed the Flooded Forest , ran through the village of Tavilar and the hills of Beluar's Hunt and ended at Kurth. On the way, it joined the Pass Trail and the North Road .</p>
<p>The minstrel Lieshann , traveling from Tavilar to Kurth, once took a wrong turn onto the trail to the Mage's Tower , having mistaken it for the Hunt Trail.</p>
