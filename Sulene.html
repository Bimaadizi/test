<p>Sulene was a young woman who worked at the Downunda Patisserie in Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had blue eyes that went well with the blue ruffled apron she wore.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a charming and cheery girl.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the Downunder Patisserie had its Sixth Anniversary Celebration, with many new treats and drinks on sale. One day, while Sulene was working the front counter, a group of adventurers stopped at the store for something to snack on and were served by her. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of Aethalynmur , an almost 8‑foot-tall (2.4‑meter) winged solar in a loincloth . Sulene was understandably a bit surprised by this, but asked what she could get him, though he required not a cake but heroes to liberate Nimbus City in the demi-plane of Arrus . So, Sulene served the adventurers and watched them negotiate with Aethalynmur and disappear into the planes while eating a sugar cookie and planning to tell her friends all about it.</p>
