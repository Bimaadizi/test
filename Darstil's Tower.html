<p>Darstil's Tower was the home, laboratory, and stronghold of the wizard Darstil Vurusk , Grand Arcanist of the Night Brigade in Wheloon Prison during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Darstil Vurusk used his tower as a laboratory to test his ideas upon living creatures. He was exceptionally skilled at twisting the minds and bodies of his victims, pushing them to their limits before they perished. Darstil was utterly devoted to his foul work, and was rather dismayed at how his fellow Night Brigade members were put off by it. He only reluctantly assisted the gang with mundane, non-insane projects, though was quite happy when the two goals overlapped, such as creating bespoke twisted monsters that the gang used to spy on the city. Most of his creations were dumped in an elaborate maze beneath the tower, where they would run about endlessly before either starving to death or slaying each other.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Riverside Rats began their counterattack on the Night Brigade, Wyshbryn Saldar took special interest in the Grand Arcanist. As the source of much of the gang's magical expertise and firepower, Darstil was a key target for the wererats to take out. He sent a team into the tower through the front door, and they nearly assassinated the mad mage, only to be caught and teleported into his laboratory maze. After a perilous fight through the maze and past his guardians, Darstil Vurusk was finally put down for good, sparing Wheloon Prison his presence.</p>
