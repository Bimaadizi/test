<p>Plantmen were four-armed monsters with a large, vertical maw. They emerged on the island of Ruathym during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Plantmen had a muscular, roughly humanoid shape, with four tentacle-like arms, three-taloned feet, and a vertical yellow-rimmed maw that resembled that of a venus flytrap instead of a head. Situated beneath their jaws were a pair of glowing yellow eyes. Plantmen were green-skinned.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Plantmen were aggressive, seemingly attacking non-plantmen on sight.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Plantmen attacked primarily by striking and constricting opponents with their tentacles, as well as by biting down on their restrained prey's head.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time after Labelas Enoreth and Clangeddin Silverbeard fought on Ruathym , plantmen started appearing on the island, attacking inhabitants and the crew of the Realms Master . Although the crew managed to escape thanks to the intervention of Labelas, many of the island's inhabitants died to the creatures' onslaught.</p>
