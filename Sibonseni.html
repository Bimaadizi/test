<p>Sibonseni , known as Mother Sibonseni or the Mother of Prosperity , was the chief priest of Waukeen in Port Nyanzaru , Chult during the late 15 th century DR . She was a prominent and revered figure who held a great amount of influence among the city's residents. She was also one of the city's wealthiest citizens.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mother Sibonseni was a Chultan noblewoman with heavy-lidded eyes who was often surrounded by entertainers and servants. She was known to wear a silver tiara inset with moonstone and to have a silk handbag in which she carried Bo Bo , a toy terrier .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was a big lover of music and other entertainment, hence she surrounded herself with dancers, drummers , singers, fire-swallowers, and snake charmers. She loved plays, notably comedies such as Winter in the Midnight Garden . Those who wished to flatter her were advised to send talented performers to put on a show for her.</p>
<p>She wrote her correspondences using rare and expensive inks .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From the Hall of Gold temple, Mother Sibonseni arranged charitable events and projects that helped improved conditions within the city. When she traveled through the streets, she did so in an opulent sedan chair , accompanied by musicians and assistants that distributed alms to the city's poor citizens. Despite the traffic this created, she was much beloved for her charity.</p>
<p>In addition to her religious and charitable activities, Mother Sibonseni operated her temple as one of Port Nyanzaru's largest banks. Such was her influence that she was known to negotiate trade deals directly with the Lords' Alliance . Such business meetings were often held in a private office in her villa.</p>
<p>She furthermore maintained the single largest army of mercenaries out of any individual within Port Nyanzaru. These troops were supplemented by acolytes of her church who helped to provide security for their chief priest.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She lived in a grand stone villa atop Temple Hill in the city's Merchants' Ward , with high ceilings and windows, polished marble floors, and teak doors. She kept her home filled with light—from oil lamps and torches —and with the fragrances of incense and of the jungle. The walls were adorned with stuffed dinosaur heads, silver cages containing red sorcery crows , Chultan relics and stone tablets, maps , and polished cabinets containing Chultan antiques, spears , and masks as well as chunks of meteorites . Twin staircases led to a second floor from the entrance hall, and a complete tyrannosaurus skeleton stood between them. The villa itself was surrounded by lush gardens—filled with lime and palm trees as well as ornamental pools containing lilies and crocodiles . The gardens were in turn surrounded by a 15‑foot-high (4.6‑meter) stone wall topped with shards of jagged glass to deter intruders.</p>
<p>Visitors to the villa entered through a wrought iron gate and were searched for weapons before meeting with Sibonseni in an open atrium lit by hanging lanterns on painted columns surrounding a rectangular pool. The priestess sat upon a leopardskin divan and guests sat on cushions, where they were offered hookah .</p>
<p>Within her villa's library, Sibonseni maintained an extensive collection of maps, almanacs , histories, and navigational charts of the perilous shipping lanes along Chult's Wild Coast . These were so valuable to foreign sailors and traders that she was able to use them as leverage in trade negotiations, much to the consternation of groups like the Lords' Alliance. Naturally, the most valuable pieces were kept in a locked chest outfitted with a trap designed to put out a thief 's eye.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Sibonseni's popularity and influence transcended class divides, making her perhaps the most influential figure in Port Nyanzaru who was not among the seven merchant princes . However, some speculated that she aspired to join the princes' ranks, attracting the suspicions of at least some of them, notably Jessamine and Zhanthi .</p>
<p>The master-at-arms of her personal mercenaries was Kwalu Mosi . Unbeknownst to her, he was actually loyal to the merchant prince Zhanthi.</p>
<p>She was owed a favor by the jungle guide Azaka Stormfang .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mother Sibonseni was involved in negotiating a trade agreement between Port Nyanzaru and Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>When the Running of the Saurs was held during the time of the death curse , a group of pirates tried to take advantage of the chaos to rob the Hall of Gold. Their captain tried and failed to intimidate Mother Sibonseni.</p>
<p>When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the fiendish pirates of Captain Idrianne Smoke , Sibonseni refused to lend her mercenary army to the fight, claiming that the city's defense was the responsibility of the merchant princes. This prompted the princes to send agents to subvert her control over her troops and to mobilize them without her consent.</p>
