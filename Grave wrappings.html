<p>The grave wrappings were a set of magical " handwraps " found in the graveyard of Deep Glen in Cormyr during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The handwraps were made from the mouldering fabric corpse-wraps of an interred corpse.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wraps were filled with destructive, entropic energy, and made the wearer's physical blows more stunning. They also possessed an evilness that weakened any good person that tried to use them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The grave wrappings were naught but mundane cloth in the grave until House Szind attacked Deep Glen and their necromancers began animating the contents of the graveyard. The wrappings absorbed this necromantic energy and became something more.</p>
