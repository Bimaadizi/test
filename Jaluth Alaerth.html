<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her middle age, Jaluth was woman of cruel beauty who possessed hot temper.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Jaluth was developing new necromantic spells in order to gain control of undead , golems , and gargoyles . She plotted to gain control over all dragons , conquer Icewind Dale , take possession of as many mines as possible, and also sack dwarven holdings and Netheril 's ruins. By 1373 DR, Jaluth found and claimed a small Netherese ruin within The Giants' Walls of the Reghed Glacier .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , after Eldeluc and Valkebar 's coup against the Archmage Arcane, Arklem Greeth , Jaluth pledged her loyalty to the conspirators. When Greeth returned, now transformed into a lich with some new devilish allies, Jaluth relocated to near Icewind Dale.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Jaluth ventured into The Giants' Walls of the Reghed Glacier in order to unlock true power of a mysterious crystal the came across. In reality, the crystal was a shard from the body of Arctus , a godling son of Auril , imprisoned in the Reghed Glacier. Jaluth was protected by animated entombed under her magical control. The wizard found Assyntia , an ice weird , who resided in the middle of a frozen lake who possessed the knowledge of the shard's true nature. The weird, however, refused to help the evil mage. The Hero of Neverwinter and their companions stumbled across Jaluth Alaerth on their quest to stop the doom of Icewind Dale, caused by the looming threat of Arctus. She offered the Hero a deal to help get the information from the stubborn ice weird. The Hero agreed and the weird offered them the knowledge of the crystal and warned not to pass that information along to the evil mage. It was unknown if the Hero of Neverwinter confronted Jaluth and was attacked by her entombed or if they shared the weird's knowledge with her in exchange for a set of powerful enchanted armor â€“ Chain of Drakkas . Jaluth sought to try and bend the imprisoned godling's power to her will.</p>
