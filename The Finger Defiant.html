<p>The Finger Defiant was a mesa in southern Mulhorand , excavated by the dwarf geomancer Thormud Horn over long years. He used to call it simply "the mesa", until he took Kiril Duskmourn as his bodyguard; she insisted on the name until he took it up too. The mesa contained storerooms, libraries, halls, galleries, and even balconies. There was an exposed spiral staircase outside the mesa.</p>
