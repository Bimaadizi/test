<p>Tuoxent , the Seventh City of the Sword , was one of the member cities in the confederated empire of Jhaamdath .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city of Tuoxent was on the western frontier of Jhaamdath's core below the Deepwing Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tuoxent was founded in −5250 DR , as the seventh of the realm's major cities. It was paired with the construction of its twin city Hollinth that same year.</p>
<p>Jhaamdath entered into a short period of imperialistic expansion in the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , which resulted in the deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves . The elves responded in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR , by casting a High Magic ritual that caused a huge wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the heartlands of Jhaamdath, all the way to distantly inland Tuoxent. The cities were drowned in the new Vilhon Reach , and Tuoxent became a sunken ruin imbued with stray psionic energy from its lost relics.</p>
<p>The sunken realm of Jhaamdath was suddenly revealed by lowered sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . The situation was then returned to its previous state in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering .</p>
