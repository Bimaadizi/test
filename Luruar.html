<p>Luruar , also commonly known as the Silver Marches , was a confederation of cities in the north of Faerûn , under the leadership of Alustriel Silverhand , former ruler of Silverymoon. It consisted of Silverymoon , Citadel Adbar , Deadsnows , Jalanthar , Quaervarr , Citadel Felbarr , Everlund , Mithral Hall , and Sundabar , and its goal was to protect the North against the growing horde of orcs in the mountains.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was bordered by the Anauroch desert to the east, the High Forest to the south, the Evermoors to the west and the Spine of the World mountain range to the north. Through Mithral Hall , Luruar also shared a border with the kingdom of Many-Arrows .</p>
<h2>Geographical features</h2>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The League of Silver Marches began in 1371 DR as a confederation of city-states, united to defend themselves from a common threat. The League itself was governed by a council of nine Peers who would be called to meet every six months or sooner by the High Lord or Lady, also known as the Speaker, of the League: each of the larger cities — Silverymoon , Citadel Adbar , Citadel Felbarr , Everlund , Mithral Hall , and Sundabar — would send one representative Peer each (likely their ruler, but any chosen individual would be given voting rights); the Argent Legion 's commander, called the Shining Guard or High Marshal , would be the seventh Peer; the eighth would be the Lord or Lady Protector, a representative of the protectorates, those such as Auvandell , Rivermoot , Jalanthar , and Quaervarr who laid within the Silver Marches but without signatory privilege; and the ninth Peer would be a rotating individual, chosen for the position by the Speaker of the Silver Marches, known as a Member at Large.</p>
<p>These nine Peers would choose a High Lord or Lady from within their ranks to head the meetings of the League. The Speaker's responsibilities, beyond calling the League's meetings, included breaking vote ties, arranging each meeting's agenda, and acting as the ultimate judge within the Marches, though the last was subject to council review.</p>
<p>As of 1372 DR , the League's first council consisted of High Mage Taern Hornblade of Silverymoon , King Harbromm of Citadel Adbar , King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr , First Elder Kayl Moorwalker of Everlund , King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall , and Lord Helm Dwarf-Friend of Sundabar as the six signatory Peers, and High Marshal Methrammar Aerasumé of the Argent Legion , Lady Protector Alustriel Silverhand (who also acted as the first Speaker of the Silver Marches), and Member-at-Large Old Night as the three remaining Peers.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Due to its bounty of natural resources, and the open-trade mindset of its confederated cities and towns, the Silver Marches were rich with opportunities to find wealth and fortune. The lands were vast and fertile enough for farmlands to produce ample food and ranches to raise small herds of livestock. Its rivers, forests, and mountains supported the livelihoods of many fishermen, furriers, lumberers and miners. Merchants plied their goods between the various cities of the marches, by wagon or barge, and further out to destinations beyond.</p>
<p>Various common and uncommon currencies were accepted in the cities of the Marches, though less so in the smaller towns. Silverymoon minted a coin unique to the region, called a moon , that was accepted all throughout the region.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Due to the many perils and hostile forces that made home in the North, the Silver Marches' first line of defense often came in the form of information. Many small groups of city-sponsored scouts, bands of rangers , adventuring companies , independent cells of Harpers , and others scouted the stretches of Wilderness that often presented threats to the civilized lands. Many of the smaller towns maintained their own local patrols, comprised of militiamen and other volunteer defenders.</p>
<p>While each of the cities maintained their own armed forces, such as the Knights in Silver of Silverymoon and the Army of the Vale in Everlund , the combined armies of the marches banded together for quite some time, forming the collective Argent Legion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The years 1368 through 1370 DR were particularly turbulent for the city-states of the North . Troll attacks, orc hordes, an combined army of demons and barbarians as well as a particularly harsh winter spurred the leaders of those cities to convene a council. After many heated arguments were calmed by Alustriel's diplomatic skills, it was decided that the cities would band together and form a confederation under Alustriel's leadership. Alustriel declared, at the suggestion of Old Night , that the nation would be known as "Luruar" in honor of the goddess Lurue , sometime between the winter and midsummer of 1371 DR. She rejected the suggestions of "New Delzoun", in honor of the fallen dwarf kingdom, and "Alustryr", in honor of herself.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , after Alustriel's apparent demise, her eldest son, Methrammar Aerasumé , was High Lord of Luruar. The League had lost the support of Citadel Adbar , Citadel Felbarr and Mithral Hall , whose leaders refused to spend effort and resources helping smaller settlements at the expense of their own. Though the three cities remained allies of Luruar, they no longer considered themselves members of the confederation, nor could they be relied upon to answer calls for help.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , the Darkening was cast over the region in preparation for the drow and orc invasion. The attacks involved sieges and attacks on Winters Edge , Mithral Hall, Nesmé , and Silverymoon, as well as subterfuge interfering with trade in Blingdenstone . The spell was finally overcome by a band of adventurers, during the battle of Eryndlyn .</p>
<p>Ultimately however, thanks to disagreements following the war, the League of Silver Marches was disbanded in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR . The Silvaeren were blamed for providing insufficient aid for Sundabar , whose surface population had been completely wiped out. As a result, all of the dwarven states left the League of Silver Marches, and without their support, Luruar collapsed.</p>
