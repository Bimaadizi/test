<p>During the Siege of Neverwinter , in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Hawthidon recruited an adventurer to the Neverwinter Guard, and fought alongside them against the undead minions of Valindra Shadowmantle .</p>
<p>Afterward, Hawthidon was part of the contingent gathered in the Blacklake District of the city to stop the Nashers rebel group.

Hawthidon sent the adventurer to Gothwan's known haunts to find clues, which showed he'd been kidnapped by the Dead Rats ; then to retrieve him from the Dead Rats; and finally to work with Private Zoey Fargo to defeat Nasher leader Karzov .</p>
