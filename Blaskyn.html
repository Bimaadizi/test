<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1357 DR , Blaskyn had been the apprentice of Laeral Rythkyn for years. In mid- Kythorn of that year, she departed to find Thalon's Throne , leaving him to watch over her home with the helm of hiding . However, unknown to Laeral, he followed her; after she defeated the lich guarding Thalon's Throne , he ambushed her with a rockfall and then filched many of her magical items while she was still alive. He also sat on the throne himself; unknown to him, it turned him into the undead host to Thalon 's malign intelligence.</p>
