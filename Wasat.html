<p>Wasat , or the Middle City , was located in Zakhara on the eastern shore of Suq Bay .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Wasat lay on the major trade route between Huzuz and Hiyal , at the narrow middle of Suq Bay.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Called the "Shining City" by a court rawun , Wasat did indeed shine in the sunlight courtesy of its white-washed buildings. Sadly, the city was cloaked in fog or haze on most days.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite its strategic location, it was a rather quiet waystation for travelers by land and sea along the golden trade route. Its residents were known for their even disposition. The majority of the city's commerce and business activities centered around providing services to traveling merchants.</p>
<h2>Armed Forces</h2>
<p>The palace guard was comprised of 800 soldiers. In addition to that Wasat was protected by a pair of mamluk units of the Studious , each 300 strong. The lands surrounding the city were patrolled by a force of 800 cavalry and the waters of Suq Bay near the city were monitored by three warships.</p>
