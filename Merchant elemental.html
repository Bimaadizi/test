<p>Merchant elementals , also known by the name of their creator, Leomund's merchant elementals , were a special variety of elemental creatures that could perform functions of a shopkeep.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merchant elementals were strange beings that bore an uncanny resemblance to the individual who summoned or created them. They looked like animated and intelligent people made of stone. The elemental was placed on a mage's circle and emitted slight steam.</p>
<p>An alternative to Leomund's merchant elemental was Aphelda's vendor golem . However, the golem was an utter mercantile pushover.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were stoic, quiet, and behaved like competent store owners, performing all tasks a real shopkeep did on a daily basis. They could purchase, sell, and haggle over the store's stock. Skilled wizard store keeps could be sure that Leomund's merchant elemental left in charge of their stores did an adequate job. Those who witnessed Leomund's merchant elementals claimed that the creatures had understanding and empathetic facial expressions and had a keen business sense.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Merchant elementals were not part of the natural way of things. They did not need to nourish themselves nor needed sleep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Leomund 's merchant elementals were extremely rare, and it was unclear if they were summoned creatures or crafted and animated. Those who knew this secret did not feel the need to divulge that information. In the 1374Â DR , one such creature served elven shop owner and wizard Sand of Neverwinter . The elf entrusted his merchant elemental to run the shop while Sand joined Kalach-Cha during the Shadow War .</p>
