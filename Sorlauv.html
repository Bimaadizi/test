<p>Sorlauv was a man of Athkatla in Amn around the 5 th century DR .</p>
<p>Sorlauv captured a number of treants and conducted experiments on them, with the goal of making an army of powerful warriors who did not need food, coin, or barracks, but who could be simply planted in the earth when not required. This was until Eldrus Wands , the Magister from 409 DR to 516 DR , destroyed his fortress to "persuade" him to release the treants.</p>
