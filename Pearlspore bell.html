<p>Pearlspore bells were a species of huge mundane mushrooms that could be imbued with haggish fell magics, found sometime growing in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Pearlspore bells was known to be used by hags to avoid being slain. A hag could link herself with one of several clusters of pearlspore bells and, eventually, be reborn through the fungi after being slain. This was believed to be a speculation by some.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The book called Fastidious Fungi included some information on hags and the pearlspore bell mushrooms that could be used to return a slain hag to the land of the living. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a copy of Fastidious Fungi was studied by Mayrina after forming the Anti-Hag Support Group , in search of ways to stop hags' sinister and malicious plots. The same year, green hag Auntie Ethel imbued several pearlspore bells with her magics in attempts to keep herself alive. The mushrooms were planted in her subterranean lair under the Blushing Maiden Inn .</p>
