<p>The World Tree was a sentient tree-like cosmic structure in the World Tree cosmology model that connected all of the Celestial planes to each other.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>The World Tree's roots were located in Dwarfhome and Arvandor , its lower branches in Green Fields , the House of the Triad and Dweomerheart , its main trunk along the House of Knowledge , Golden Hills and Brightwater , and at the top were the Gates of the Moon .</p>
<p>Normal planar travel used the Astral plane to pass from the Prime Material Plane to one of the other Outer planes and all inter-planar journeys had to pass through the Prime Material nexus. Angelic servants of the good deities used the tree as a kind of "celestial ladder" to avoid having to go through the Prime Material plane, although the tree did not enjoy being used as such.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Mortal travelers would often meet celestial treants and dryads sent to prevent their passage. However, if their intentions were noble enough the tree usually allowed them to pass unhindered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The World Tree was destroyed in 1385Â DR by the Spellplague .</p>
