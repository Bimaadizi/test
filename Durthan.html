<p>The Durthans were a secretive group of women who operated in Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They called upon the darker spirits of the country. They were the antithesis of the Witches of Rashemen and worked against them for the rulership of the realm.</p>
<p>They wore masks like the hathrans to disguise their identities and pretended that they were of the same order.</p>
<p>They used dark magic and were very seductive.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Coven, 595 DR , the durthans attempted to overthrow the order and seize Rashemen. Strife between the hathrans and their dark sisters lasted for decades, but the durthans were eventually defeated.</p>
<p>While Thay was distracted with the War of the Zulkirs over 1375 â€“ 1385 DR , the wychlaran took this opportunity to wage their own war against the durthans. By 1479 DR , the durthans were defeated, Citadel Tralkarn was destroyed, and their organization was no more.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The durthans secretly used the Erech Forest similar to how the hathrans used the Urlingwood . They constructed Citadel Tralkarn within the forest.</p>
