<p>The Frozen Sea was one of the regions of Anauroch , the great desert of Faerûn , located on its western edge.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Frozen Sea was the part of Anauroch lying west of the High Ice . Here, where that massive glacier ended gave rise instead to the hard ground of frozen sand . The place was a maze of natural sand sculptures, shaped by the wind and frozen by the cold. The area was void of any water or ice.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>In springtime, life briefly appeared in the Frozen Sea, as low-growing ground plants briefly grew. During this time many varieties of birds would fly here to breed. Outside this narrow time, little life could be found here.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −33,800 DR , the Isstosseffifil empire's wizards rerouted the Narrow Sea in an effort to drown the phaerimm inhabiting Phaerlin . This resulted in a massive ecological change that devastated their empire, and shifted the position of the waters. The basin that remained behind eventually became the Frozen Sea.</p>
<p>During the golden age of Netheril the area not still part of the Narrow Sea was a grassy plain known as the Rengarth Ancestral Lands for the Rengarth that lived in and patrolled the area. .</p>
<p>In −461 DR , the phaerimm started casting spells in the land of Netheril that eventually caused the creation of Anauroch. By Karsus's Folly the area was already turning to sand.</p>
