<p>The Red Wolf , also known as the Lone Hunter , was a being said to be the mightiest and fiercest warrior among the wild elf tribes of Elfharrow . Some claimed he was merely a lone killer, while others characterized him as a righter of wrongs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Little was known about the Red Wolf save for tales told by the tribes. He was said to have the appearance of a tall elf dressed as a hunter, except when he instead appeared as a massive, red-furred wolf .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , he was said to hunt alone across the blasted lands of Elfharrow. On occasion, young warriors from among the Elfharrow tribes would seek him out to prove themselves his equal in combat, but all who did so inevitably died by his hand.</p>
<p>In the rare event that the Red Wolf chose to meet with a tribe, the chiefs and shamans of Elfharrow always listened to his words and obeyed his instructions.</p>
