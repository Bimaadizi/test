<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Kaylie worked with the dragon Jurin'ildren to protect an intact library in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Unfortunately, just as the Elves of Cormanthor arrived to reclaim the city, planar fluctuations caused rifts to the Elemental Plane of Fire to draw fiery creatures into the great treehouse, turning it into the Burning Library . While Jurin'ildren's abilities could keep the contents of the library safe for a time, Kaylie desperately needed some hands to get rid of the intruders before they annihilated the whole tree. Meeting Jurin'ildren's help at the entrance, she directed them to the different areas of the library to find Nepri , T'Zull , and Thulkaan while guarding the entrance and helping maintain the magical defenses.</p>
