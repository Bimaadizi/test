<p>The Great Glacier , also called Pelvuria was a large mass of frozen land in northeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Glacier was created in −2550 DR when the god Ulutiu laid himself to rest in his ice barge in the Cold Ocean, a favorite inland sea of his. The barge sank soon after and the Necklace of Ulutiu , an artifact that he wore, encased his body in ice when his divinity had departed to the Astral Plane .</p>
<p>The Cold Ocean became completely frozen by the necklace's magic over the next seventy five years then, due to a lack of interference from the giant kingdom of Ostoria , encroached upon the land as well. The glacier eventually destroyed the remains of Ostoria (the city of Gharreil was a testimony to its former existence) By the year −2475 DR , the Great Glacier had covered the Cold Lands of Vaasa , Damara , and Narfell with thick ice, driving out the inhabitants, but the expansion was held in check by the High Magic of the elves of Lethyr in −2465 DR .</p>
<p>Some rumors credited the extremely old gold dragon Protanther the creation of the Glacier, as one of his plans to get rid of the evil from Vaasa. Although there was no absolute proof of this, given Protanther's outstanding magical abilities, such a feat was not impossible for him, giving credence to this rumor.</p>
<p>Three thousand years later, in the Year of Burning Skies, 632 DR , the Ice Queen Iyraclea was granted the power to overcome the High Magic by Auril and the glacier began to grow larger once more.</p>
<p>In the Year of Spreading Spring, 1038 DR , a slight shift in the rotation of Toril caused minor changes to weather around the world. In the Cold Lands, the Great Glacier began to melt and retreat, and the lands of Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell became free of ice for the first time in ages.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wall, 1227 DR , one of the great explorers of Vaasan history, Palus Frohm , set out on an exploration of the Great Glacier that lasted for 20 years. Upon his return, he wrote the definitive guide to arctic regions, 'Blood and Ice: Survival in the Great Glacier'. In the Year of the Weeping Moon, 1339 DR a distant descendant of Paulus, Sharra Frohm , set out to follow up her ancestors work with a book that would focus on the perilous Nakvaligach region, which was an area that Palus had been unable to explore fully in his time. Sharra began her solo mission by climbing onto the the Great Glacier approximately 100 miles northeast of the Frozen Forest.</p>
<p>With the death of Iyraclea in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Glacier began to shrink more quickly. By the late 15 th century DR , the Glacier had become bordered by vast, muddy bogs fed by streams of meltwater from the retreating ice sheet. As it melted, it began to reveal chillborn zombie -infested ruins—such as the lost city of Vaalathrim —and passages to the monster-infested Frostfell . The denizens of these places began to plague northern Vaasa and Damara.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Pelvuria hosted several distinct societies in Alpuk , Angalpuk , Nakvaligach , and Novularond . This included three of the four Ulutiun peoples: the Iulutiun people of Alpuk, the Angulutiun of Angalpuk, and the Nakulutiun people of Nakvaligach. In addition, white dragons and frost giants were known to live there.</p>

<h3>Portal to the Ruins of Gharreil</h3>
<p>A featureless sheet of ice deep inside a crevice in the Great Glacier marked the entrance to the ruined city of Gharreil . In shadow and darkness, the ice appeared black, but when directly illuminated by the sun overhead, it appeared bright blue and an inscription was revealed. This inscription was written in a large circle on the smooth ice wall, in characters of the ancient giant tongue.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some believed that aasimon began construction on an empyreal citadel underneath the ice of the glacier in response to events triggered by the ruins at Hellgate Keep .</p>
