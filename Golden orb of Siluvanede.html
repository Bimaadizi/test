<p>The golden orbs of Siluvanede were enchanted spheres crafted by the sun elves of the ancient realm of Siluvanede (c. −8400 DR to 882 DR ) in the High Forest to defend against magical assault.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each was a sphere of the most pure gold , 1 inch (0.025 meters) in diameter. They were imprinted with the symbols of the Siluvanedenn noble houses that owned them. They were carried in different ways, such as hung from fine chains and worn as pendants, or simply held or pocketed, or even further enchanted to hover around an owner, like ioun stones did.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Designed to shield against a foe's first magical assault, a golden orb held a Siluvanedenn abjuration spell much like the later Elminster's effulgent epuration , being able to absorb and negate a spell directed at the bearer. It functioned continuously, but it could absorb only one spell a day. The bearer could choose whether to use it, but the orb granted no knowledge of the incoming spell.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The golden orbs were so costly to craft that each noble house could only own one. This was traditionally borne by the eldest member of the house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The golden orbs were created by Siluvanedenn sun elves of the greater noble houses, at the height of their realm's power.</p>
<p>When Siluvanede was defeated by Eaerlann and Sharrven in the Seven Citadels' War in −4300 DR , the majority of golden orbs were confiscated and stored in secure vaults.</p>
<p>After the liberation of the imprisoned Siluvanedenn fey'ri in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , they desired to recover stolen ancestral relics such as the golden orbs .</p>
<h2>Whereabouts</h2>
<p>At least one golden orb of Siluvanede was recorded by the Harpers to have been lost inside Hellgate Keep when Eaerlann was brought down by demons in the Year of the Curse, 882 DR .</p>
<p>Another golden orb existed in the hoard of the "Druid Dragon" Gildenfire by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . It was hidden in a disguised weir tree in one of his treasure caches in the High Forest.</p>
<p>A golden orb was valued at around 30,600 gp in 1370s DR money.</p>
