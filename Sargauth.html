<p>The Sargauth was a subterranean river in the Northdark that ran deep under the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The River Sargauth meandered through the third level of Undermountain , passing the Lair of the Eye and the Promenade of the Dark Maiden on its way, before it flowed into the estuary basin of Skull Pool south of Skullport from the east.</p>
<p>The river itself was brackish and mineral-laden, but not salt water. The current was moderate and moved ships along at a fair, though not rapid, pace. Barges and rafts had no problem navigating most of its length, but ships must know the routes along it, or they sometimes ran aground on sandbars and shallow, gravel-covered spots. Fortunately, the Sargauth, as it neared Skullport , was rather deep and could easily accommodate even keeled vessels for a distance.</p>
<h2>Fishing</h2>
<p>Large, rather bland blind fish that the locals called gumpfish lived in the Sargauth, along with some other varieties of fish , clams , other mollusks, and ghost shrimp, all of which fed on smaller fish, tiny crustaceans, and larvae.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town of Skullport was found on the banks of the river.</p>
