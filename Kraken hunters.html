<p>" Kraken hunters " were mercenaries available for hire at the harbor of Westgate as of the late 15 th century DR who promised to protect ships from kraken attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the rise of the Abolethic Sovereignty in the Sea of Fallen Stars during the 15 th century DR, anxiety arose that their kraken minions would attack ships. In Westgate, this led to the rise of self-proclaimed "kraken hunter" agencies, which branded themselves with fearsome names and provided spear -wielding mercenaries who promised to protect merchants' cargo and to secure shipping lanes.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , it was well-known among the kraken hunters themselves that a kraken attack was exceedingly unlikely, and so most of them simply expected to collect their pay without risk. The most capable among them, however, seemed to take their job seriously and kept a close eye on rumors about Xxiphu .</p>
