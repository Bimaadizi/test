<p>Nyatar was an elven druid activist who sold his goods in the city of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nyatar was an even male with a light skin tone and delicate features. He wore a druid's leather armor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the deadly Wailing Death plague of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR seized the city of Neverwinter, Nyatar found himself peddling his druidic spells and lightly enchanted goods in the City Core . However, he also sought a partner in crime. Nyatar was convinced that it was not only the townies who suffered in the plague but also the city's animal life. Namely, he believed that the animals suffered in cages in the Blacklake District Lodge , a zoo in Neverwinter. Nyatar spied on the lodge's hunter who ran the zoo and his employees and concluded that the lodge was cramped, filthy, and the beasts were mistreated. The druid feared that as the Wailing Death tightened its grip on the Jewel of the North, the animals â€“ a bear , panther , wolf , and lion , would be slain and turned into trophies.</p>
<p>Nyatar petitioned with the city officials for the zoo's closure but the dire times meant that such requests would likely be postponed until later and those few officials who supported the druid's quest ended up dead by the plague while many others opposed Nyatar, sponsored by the city's nobles.</p>
<p>Nyatar thought through a plan to find a willing criminal or an adventurer to break into the zoo and free the animals. He created a scented fetish that was ensorcelled with the ability to grant a ranger 's or a druid's ability to commune with animals onto the fetish's owner and created a scroll of transport via plants to help them escape. If he were to find a willing adventurer, he offered a humble reward for the deed. It was unknown if Nyatar's plan came to fruition before the war between Neverwinter and Luskan further weakened the city.</p>
