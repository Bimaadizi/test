<p>Antimagic was a type of spell effect that cancelled magic altogether. It was considered very powerful, being the supreme defense against magic, though it was itself the product of magic.</p>
<p>Unlike dispel magic , it did not abort an active spell or magical effect, but merely suppressed it while it was in the antimagic-affected area.</p>
<p>Antimagic was primarily produced by the antimagic field spell or by the beholder 's antimagic cone, which replicated the effects of antimagic field . Scalamagdrions were also known to have antimagic powers.</p>
