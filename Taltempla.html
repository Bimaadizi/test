<p>Taltempla , or the City of Magic , was a peaceful and harmonic city and the second-largest settlement on the elven isle of Evermeet in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Taltempla was a large elven city, wondrous sight for those beholding it for the first time. Its breathtaking appearance echoed ancient eras when the Fair Folk ruled Faerûn . The city was encircled by a clear crystal wall. All of its buildings were crafted with very few straight lines in order to appear like natural formations made of white and green marble . A big portion of Taltempla's buildings were conjured deep from the island's earth. The city was filled with greens of the parks, marble shrines, and groves used by the elves to worship the Seldarine or for meditation. The city harbor was built on the bay, forming Taltempla's southeastern border.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Taltempla stood on Evermeet's east coast, northeast of the town of Ruith . It was built on a natural bay in the Trackless Sea. It stood on the Wizard's Road that hugged Taltempla's southwestern walls.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Taltempla had no government, and the locals did not need it. They were comfortable in leaving their harmonious lives, practicing sorcery, and worshiping the Seldarine.
