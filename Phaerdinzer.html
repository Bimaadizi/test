<p>The Phaerdinzer clan was a family of magically powerful individuals extant in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Phaerdinzers were sharp-featured, with unusual eye colors such as emerald, ice-blue, and gray, and hair most often auburn, red, or brown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The clan had been fostered by Maxiladanarr Torstren during his reign as the Magister , from 1322 DR to 1328 DR . He determined that some archmage had experimented on them "until their veins ran with magic". As this was not a normal occurrence, he considered there was something special about their experimentation or about their makeup.</p>
<p>More immediately before his fostering, they had been shopkeepers, mostly in the furniture and medicine business, for a long time. Their members had practiced magic, but took care to hide the true extent of their powers.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , the clan was led by Othlo Phaerdinzer and Jasurra Phaerdinzer , who remained in their Tallstones mansion in Athkatla , Amn . Their most likely successor was Dartabba Shoukyn .</p>
<p>The clan counted about six hundred people, of which two hundred may have been mages of some accomplishment, as most never developed their power beyond a handful of spells.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Phaerdinzers were never in any risk of their body failing while midway through a transformation. They also had the ability to use a number of minor magics at will, such as a form of silence that affected only them, a short-range form of telekinesis out to 20 feet (6.1 meters), and the ability to levitate themselves or feather fall . About half of them also had one more power, like dancing lights , invisibility , detect thoughts , detect invisibility , locate object , spider climb , or sleep .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Most people saw the Phaerdinzers as ambitious merchants who just loved their work.</p>
<p>Phaerdinzers never admitted to any power, making excuses for it by blaming it on sorcerous wares, for instance. They thought their powers were probably a prank from the gods, maybe one that they'd be let in on some day a few generations hence.</p>
