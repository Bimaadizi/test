<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1482 DR , not long after Abdel Adrian 's death on Returning Day , there was a large holdup at the Basilisk Gate . Mareak, along with several others, wished to pass through the gate, but some sort of "city shield" had been stolen from the Harbormaster's Office . The toll collector of the gate, Nant Thangol , demanded everyone be searched, and to acquire fees from them. Mareak was very unhappy about this, and planned to convince the Heroes of the Wide to have a word with Thangol. Specifically, he wanted to heroes to sympathise with him and help the poor folk home to their dinners.</p>
