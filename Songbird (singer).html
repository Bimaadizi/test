<p>The Songbird was the stage-name of a talented half-elf singer and actor popular in Turmish in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was known for her incredible beauty and grace.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Songbird was drawing audiences with her new cycle of ballads revolving around the mythical Princess Arissaea . However, after every show, a few people who were in her audience were found to have vanished. Those who investigated could find no cause, no connection between them, and no common elementâ€”not gender, not occupation, not place of residence, and not fortune, though as some of the missing persons to heirs to wealthy families and merchant companies, attention increased. The Songbird was interviewed; she insisted she had no idea what was behind it, although, strangely, divination magic did not appear to work on her. Authorities hired adventurers to search for the missing persons and for those behind them.</p>
