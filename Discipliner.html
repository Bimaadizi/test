<p>Discipliners were created by Hergal Norin of Narfell. The wizard used these rings to discipline his most egotistical students. He presented a Discipliner to a student for their "obvious brilliance" to teach them a lesson in humility.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , several of these rings could be found on the Sword Coast . A mad sage Arcand sought to recover a Discipliner from a certain shipwreck to the south from Baldur's Gate for one deluded reason or the other. Another ring was in the lair of the cursed spider -woman of the Cloak Wood , Centeol . And lastly, one more of these enchanted rings was in possession of a djinni merchant Khan Zahraa in Trademeet on a hunt for a rakshasa . Khan was ready to "reward" an unhelpful adventurer with the cursed ring.</p>
