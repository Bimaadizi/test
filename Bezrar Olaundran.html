<p>Bezrar Olaundran was a member of the Olaundran merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bezrar was a swarthy, handsome fellow, although he was overweight from feasting and living a life of luxury. As a general rule, he wore fine clothing made from a true gold-colored (never yellow) cloth called shimmerweave , trimmed in white or cream. Olaundrans were self-styled nobles and when not wearing house colors Bezrar wore the latest fashion.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bezrar was haughty and cruel to those beneath him, demanding his way and strict adherence to etiquette. Being very wealthy, he never bargained with shopkeepers, always paying the asking price as if money meant nothing to him.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When they were not indulging in their newest hobbies, Bezrar and his older brother Yolaun quietly took over the reins of the family business from their father, Gauthklaun , because he was getting old and frail.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bezrar was the second son of Gauthklaun, the patriarch of the clan, and brother to Yolaun. Bezrar was unmarried and had no children (that were officially recognized, at least).</p>
