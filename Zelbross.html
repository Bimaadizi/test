<p>Zelbross was a hamlet in the Delimbiyr Vale in the Savage Frontier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay on the Delimbiyr Route , halfway between Loudwater and Secomber . Here there were rich natural clay pits along the banks of the River Shining .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Circa 1365 DR , around 120 people lived here, largely quiet farm-folk and including a dozen or so aged crafts-folk.</p>
<p>The people of Zelbross had a thick and unusual accent, enough that the words "hark" and "hawk" sounded nearly the same. This was posited as a possible cause of the varying name of the Dungeon of the Hark and its rulers.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>Zelbross's potters produced all kinds of pottery of excellent quality. Traveling merchants and peddlers came through and bought all they could for resale elsewhere.</p>
<p>In particular, Zelbross was famed for its clay smoking pipes. These were baked iron-hard and had a mottled, tortoise-shell finish. They could be found all over Faerûn . While they were sold locally for 5 sp each, in Waterdeep the price rose to 1 gp each and all smoking nobles there owned at least one.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zelbross was considered a very old settlement by the mid–14 th century DR , and possibly was established here because of the rich clay that could be found in the vicinity.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , Zelbross lay in ruins.</p>
