<p>The Falls of Tumbling Stars was a waterfall and hidden mountain valley in the Thunder Peaks north of Cormyr . It was believed sacred to Mielikki , the Lady of the Forest, and most significant site of the church of Mielikki in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The falls stood on the Immerflow river just after its headwaters in the Twin Peaks of Urlspur . The Immerflow ran from north-east to south-west and cascaded down the mountainsides, where it met the long East Way linking Sembia and Cormyr before it continued into the Hullack Forest . The whole valley was concealed from the wider world and could only be reached via secret trails.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Within the vale were a number of holy pools. Anyone who was wounded and bathed in these would, by Mielikki's grace, be miraculously restored.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The vale was home to a small community of human and half-elf Walkers of the Forest Way, including highly skilled rangers and priests of Mielikki.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , the Mielikkian community here was led jointly by Hawk of the Lady Neretheen Jalassan , a priestess, and by Hawk of the Lady Beldryn Stormstone , who was Lord Ranger.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The valley was well-defended against trespassers by Mielikkian rangers and archers, who all had lethal prowess with the bow .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Mielikkians would escort their fellow faithful and injured people in need of healing to the vale via the secret trails. It was also a setting off point for high-ranking members of the church to make pilgrimages to the far-off Unicorn's Run .</p>
<p>They were also the greatest enemies of the Bloodmoon Circle of Malarites based at the Wyvernstones of Hullack . In this, they were joined by members of the church of Eldath operating in the area.</p>
