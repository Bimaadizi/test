<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to a simple +1 defensive enchantment, these boots gave the wearer complete immunity to being restrained and paralysis .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to a legend, these boots once belonged to an unnamed knight who stood watch over his father's tomb for many years. It was believed that the knight's father was interred with great treasures. Many tried to desecrate the tomb and all were stopped by the unnamed knight, who stood unmoving even under enemy spells .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a pair of these boots was assembled by a master smith of Luskan for a fee of 5,500 gp . He assembled the boots using parts of plate armor boots looted from near Neverwinter Wood and pieces of boots fished out of a hungry gelatinous cube from the Temple of Ghaunadaur in the Savage Frontier .</p>
