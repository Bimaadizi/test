<p>Cubic gates were legendary magical devices of planar travel, allowing users to create gates to a set of five different planes of existence and the Prime Material .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As their name implied, cubic gates were small cubes. They measured roughly 3 inches (0.076 meters) across, were fashioned from carnelian , and radiated a palpable dweomer .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each side of a cubic gate was keyed to a specific plane, though one of the six would always be keyed to the Prime Material plane. The selection of planes each side was keyed to would be purposely selected during a cubic gate's creation. When a side of a cube was pressed upon once, a gate would open to a random point on its keyed plane, whilst pressing upon it a second time would then close the gate. There could never be more than one gate opened at a time and, much like the gate spell , the gates a cubic gate created were two-way and thus always had a small chance of something coming through from their other side.</p>
<p>Pressing a side of a cubic gate twice in quick succession would instead cause an effect similar to the plane shift spell, opening a gate that forcefully pulled in the side-presser and all other creatures within a 5‑foot (1.5‑meter) radius.</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering , cubic gates could only be activated three times per day.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1368 DR , a gelatinous cube in the Maddgoth's Castle level of Undermountain had a cubic gate within it from one of the victims of a gorgon .</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR , a group of adventurers traveling to the city of Ravens Bluff were attacked by a group of bandits led by the wizard Astrid . Among their ill-gotten loot the adventurers found a cursed cubic gate that instantly transported them to the Elemental Plane of Air and eventually the Negative Material Plane . There the planewalker Rowan Darkwood rescued the adventurers with a word of recall from death by negative energy , taking them to the Astral Plane . Rowan quickly surmised that their cubic gate was cursed and that the adventurers would have to meet a certain requirement at each of its keyed planes if they wanted to get back home. He beseeched his patron deity Heimdall for guidance on the matter, but received only riddles as to how they had to progress.</p>
<p>After treating the adventurers to a heroes' feast , Rowan let them on their way. They proceeded to be taken by the cubic gate to the planes of Baator , Bytopia , Ysgard , and finally the Prime Material world of Athas . There they were thrown into a gladiatorial arena and fought many strange creatures, such as braxat and b'rohg . When the adventurers began their next big match against a team of half-giants the cubic gate finally activated for the last time, plane shifting them to a road just outside of Ravens Bluff.</p>
