<h2>Species</h2>
<h3>Dreel</h3>
<p>Dreel eels , sometimes known as trollfingers due to their appearance, were a species of river eel found in the River Reaching in the Western Heartlands . Their bodies were short, yet fat, and green-black in color. They subsisted upon algae and carrion, which kept the river's waters both clean and clear. They had a taste reminiscent of mucus, but could be quite nourishing, thus they were often fried with certain herbs or spices to mask their natural taste.</p>

<h3>Onsler</h3>
<p>Onsler eels were a species of freshwater eel that inhabited shallow streams and deep rivers throughout the Heartlands . They had pale skin, marked with dusty-white spots, and soft sucker mouths. They were sensitive to extreme temperatures and would die if water got either too cold or too hot. They were a rather passive and herbivorous species, subsisting on algae as well as aquatic mosses and lichen . They were capable of living longer than the average human; their bodies grew longer and broader as they aged, with young specimens being more cylindrical and older ones being more flatter. Their flesh had a pleasant texture, but was rather tasteless, thus they were typically doused in sauce or heavily seasoned.</p>
