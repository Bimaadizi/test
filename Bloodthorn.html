<p>Bloodthorn vines , also known as vampire vines or vampire thorns , were a species of predatory vine found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tough, wiry plants had smooth trunks that varied in brown to yellowish tones and on average grew to heights of 10 feet (3 meters). They had vines that were light green in color, yet looked desiccated, and were covered in leaves as well as sharp, hollow thorns. Their leaves were pointed, had two-lobes, and were pale in color. But once a bloodthorn fed, their leaves took on the same color as a victim's blood.</p>
<p>On average their vines grew to lengths of 7​ to ​12 feet (2.1​ to ​3.7 meters), while their thorns were typically 3 feet (0.91 meters) in length. Bright red berries also grew continually on these plants. They were juicy, yet bitter, and produced a fragrant odor that appealed to most creatures</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These plants were capable of a limited degree of movement. In addition, a few scholars believed that extreme cold could immobilize these plants and that electricity could cause them to grow.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Whenever a living creature came close to them a bloodthorn would lash out with as many of its tendrils as possible, grappling the creature and jabbing it with its thorns in an effort to extract blood. However, they typically ignored scavengers and allowed them to remove the carcasses of their victims.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Spellplague , the inhabitants of the city of New Sharandar grew bloodthorns on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>After a good feeding of three or more human -sized victims, a bloodthorn would reproduce by shooting out seed thorns away from itself. Such thorns typically flew around 10​ to ​20 feet (3​ to ​6.1 meters) away from their parent.</p>
