<p>The Gem Road was a major highway in Amn that served as the main route between Esmeltaran and Keczulla .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The road wound along the shore of Lake Esmel and the bank of the Splendarrllur river for much of its length, and passed near the rumored location of Myth Lharast .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Gem Road was heavily patrolled by a Council Army garrison based out of Keczulla that also provided escorts for caravans. During the 14 th century DR , this detachment was commanded by Colonel Gladdos Wintosnip , who ensured that his soldiers did their duty and weren't bought off by rich merchants seeking extra services.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gem Road was built as a response to the increasing wealth and prosperity of Keczulla following the discovery of the Tanislove 's new gem mines in 1355 DR . It was planned and sponsored by the Council of Six and Lord Pulth Tanislove , and construction began in 1359 DR . Although Pulth died in 1361 DR , his son Pehllus oversaw its completion in 1366 DR . The road quickly became a popular route between the two cities and increased the prosperity of both, and brought a new wave of settlers to the previously quiet countryside around Lake Esmel.</p>
