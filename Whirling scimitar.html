<p>The whirling scimitar was a Zakharan magical weapon that could bestow the ability to fly.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This item usually appeared as a scimitar , but versions in the form of a broadsword or two-handed sword also existed. It was most common in the lands of Zakhara but could be found elsewhere, too.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Used in a fight, the whirling scimitar showed a stronger magical attack potential against flying creatures than against others and a still stronger one against those from the Elemental Plane of Air . When whirled above the head of the wielder instead of attacking, it bestowed the ability of a fly spell. The ability to fly stopped immediately if the wielder lost hold of the weapon.</p>
