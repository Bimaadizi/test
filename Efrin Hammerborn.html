<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Efrin Hammerborn was a brown-haired stout dwarf who wore a chainmail and was armed with a battleaxe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before or in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Efrin Hammerborn was tricked into believing he had become infected with the disease known as Laduguer's Bite , a sickness worse than death. The Bite was highly contagious, and the dwarf was forced to leave his two beautiful young children to shield them from the same gravely fate. Desperate for his life, he sought Auntie Ethel, a hag disguised as a friendly elderly herbalist who resided in a grim lair, glamoured to appear as a friendly teahouse . Efrin asked the hag for her help in order to stop the disease. She obliged, turning him to stone, trapping him forever staring at the image of his kids, moments away from Laduguer's Bite taking the dwarf's life.</p>
