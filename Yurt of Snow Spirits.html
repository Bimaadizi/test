<p>A Yurt of Snow Spirits was a unique part of a typical Tuigan Khan's camp.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This yurt was surrounded by a wicked fence decorated with iron charms. Charms also decorated the yurt itself which was blackened with charcoal . A small offering ground sat next to the yurt as well. A yurt of snow spirits always remained empty, designated as a place for the evil snow spirits so they would leave the rest of the camp alone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These were sacred yurts dedicated to the snow spirits. Unlike all of the other yurts which always had their openings facing southeast, this yurt's opening faced northwest.</p>
