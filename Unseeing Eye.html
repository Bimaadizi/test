<p>The Unseeing Eye was a beholder who proclaimed himself a god and formed the Cult of the Eyeless .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The beholder demanded that his disciples achieve a high level of wisdom, and thus must remove their eyes. Only after removing their "unholy" eyes during a sacred initiation were they accepted into his service. Those who lacked the stamina, by not surviving the initiation, would be thrown into a pit of those who were "faithless". His "holy grounds" were the sewers of Athkatla.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Unseeing Eye and its Blinded Acolytes first were known to operate out of the city of Berdusk in the Sunset Vale sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . The Unseen Eye along with its followers were allegedly destroyed by Thom Wainwright , a hero in service of the Church of Helm . However, the elder orb resurfaced in Amnian city of Athkatla , becoming an established cult by the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
<p>The elder orb desired a valuable item, the planar rift device , beneath the reaches of Athkatla. Upon melding the two parts of the artifact, Gorion's Ward may have slain the beholder in the Pit of the Faithless .</p>
