<p>Brandeen was the common name in the Realms for a rare, fancy stone also known as the mineral stibiotantalite . They were typically worn by merchants and mid-level courtiers as a substitute for more expensive gemstones.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brandeen was found in deposits that were usually honey-yellow to reddish-brown in hue, but often cloudy or opaque. The fancy stones were cut from areas where the raw mineral turned transparent, yielding small, hard, faceted gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powdered brandeen was a key ingredient in making a potion that cured deafness. The powdered mineral was mixed with fresh hardwood sap and then a message spell was cast upon it, the message being made up of only vowel sounds. The potion had to be consumed within twenty-four hours or it spoiled. Likewise, it spoiled if exposed to sunlight.</p>
