<p>The Nameless One was a nameless human of the planes with a unique form of immortality.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rather than being protected from injury, he had regeneration abilities, like a troll . His specific brand of unending life given to him by the night hag Ravel allowed him to always rise from the dead after a certain period of time. However, with each rising, he lost large chunks of his memory, leaving him little clue as to what he was doing or even where he was.</p>
<p>To counter this disorientation, one of the Nameless One's "incarnations" had important facts tattooed on his back in large runes. These became hard to read, however, as the other side-effect of his immortality was to always bear the scars of combat. In time, the Nameless One was heavily scarred, a testament to how many times he had "died."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, a warrior named Vhailor aided the Nameless One but was destroyed in the attempt. A githzerai called Dak'kon also worked for the Nameless One, but was slain by a powerful entity. Both Vhailor's helm and Dak'kon's Zerth blade found their way to Toril and into the possession of Deidre of Aurora's Emporium . She offered them for sale at the Adventurer Mart at Waukeen's Promenade in Athkatla in 1368 DR .</p>
