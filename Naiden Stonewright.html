<p>Naiden Stonewright was a dwarven engineer active during the midâ€“12 th century DR . He was famous for building a stone bridge on the River Arkhen , which would give the town of Archenbridge its name.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A craftsman of some talent, Naiden enchanted the buttresses of the Arkhen Bridge to improve their strength and durability. Although the bridge was largely destroyed during the Year of the Talking Skull, 1293 DR due to a severe flood, the engineers who rebuilt it afterwards were able to rely on the stone casements of the original bridge.</p>
