<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Constructed of stone, the Temple of Silver Stars was a beautiful structure shaped like a single-spired tiara.

Together both worked to aid local Heralds , Harpers , and priests of Deneir in exploring and mapping both Silverymoon's surrounding countryside and the borders of the Silver Marches. A duty they continued to do well into 1372 DR . Often times, the Selûnite clergy would hire adventurers to escort them in case of marauding monsters.</p>
