<p>Annulus Conflagros was the second Qysari Ring made for the rulers of the Shoon Imperium . It gave the wearer both protection from fire and access to arcane fire spells. There were other shoonrings made during the sixth age of Calimshan ( 27 â€“ 450 DR ) with similar properties, but only one imperial ring.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other shoonrings , this ring was made from woven strands of copper made to resemble a loop of leaping flames. What distinguished this ring from the flashy copies (see below) was its behavior when donned by an individual that was not a practitioner of the Art . When placed on the finger of a cleric , druid , or other priest, the direction of the dancing flames turned at right angles to the circumference of the ring. If donned by warriors or rogues , the raised pattern of flames became smooth to the touch. Wizards saw no change in the design when placed on their finger.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This ring made the wearer completely immune to normal fires. He or she could hold the burning end of a torch with a bare hand, walk through a bonfire, and be unaffected when drenched by burning oil. Large conflagrations and hotter fires like hell hound breath or molten lava would still injure the wearer of this ring, but at a limited rate. It also greatly improved the chances of resisting attacks such as fireballs , flame strikes , and the fiery breath weapon of red dragons .</p>
<p>Offensively, this ring granted the wearer unlimited use of the pyrotechnics spell. In addition, on a daily basis the wearer could command the ring to cast burning hands three times, fireball twice, and wall of fire once.</p>
<p>Other shoonrings that mimicked the abilities of this ring were also made of copper with a flame motif, but were additionally adorned with ruby and topaz gemstones chosen for their fiery color. (This was a rare exception in the crafting of shoonrings , which ordinarily did not contain gems. ) These rings did not adapt to the wearer like the imperial ring, and were called annulus conflagros rings (without the capitalization). The protection afforded by these rings was equivalent to a minor ring of energy resistance .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This ring was commissioned by Shoon III who ruled from the Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR , to the Year of the Dwarven Twins, 130 DR , and was presumably handed down to his successors, but its chain of custody has been lost to history.</p>
