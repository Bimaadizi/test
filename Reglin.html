<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in the Great Wheel cosmology in search of the legendary Well of Mimir , having been instructed by the city's Ministry of Art to do so in order to learn how a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine could be destroyed. They arrived in the layer of Asgard by means of a ship, either the Fyrfload or Laughing Gull , having ridden as passengers from the gate-town of Glorium through the Whirling Gate . While coasting through the waters of Asgard, they eventually came across Reglin's Gloamingard along the shoreline.</p>
<p>Prior to their arrival, the wandering realm of the Seelie Court had arrived to the area and asked for Reglin's hospitality. He was quite surprised, but obliged, not wishing to offend Queen Titania . When the adventurers entered Reglin's hall they found him socializing with Titania, whilst his courtiers were busy trying to keep her rowdy fey under control. He was behaving like a nervous courtier, hoping that his talk would bore her so much that she would want to leave.</p>
<p>The adventurers were greeted by Eomar , an Asgardian warrior and member of the Fated , who went on to introduce them to Reglin and Titania. The Queen welcomed them to the plane on behalf of the Aesir, the Norse pantheon, leaving a shocked Reglin to choke from the statement. She then invited them to partake in the grand feast that Reglin had readied and expressed hope they would enjoy later festivities, which left Reglin concerned since he hadn't prepared anything.</p>
<p>After being in Gloamingard for some time, growing irritated from the fey, the adventurers watched as Queen Titania gathered the fey around her with a clap and expressed a desire for entertainment in the form of a series of contests between the mortals and fey. Unwilling to jeopardize the lives of his own men, who were largely befuddled by fey glamour and thus unlikely to perform well, he turned to the adventurers and pulled them aside. He apologized to them for not having formally extended his hospitality earlier and beseech them to help him, offering each a silver armring worth 20 gold pieces , plus a gold armring for each contest they participated in.</p>
<p>As the competition was coming to a close Gloamingard's copy of the Gjallarhorn sounded, warning of an incoming attack. Reglin jumped to his feet, brandishing his sword and shouting, "Foes come, let friends gather!". The eighty petitioners in the hall, who had been dancing and singing with the fey, transformed into einheriar . Reglin rallied everyone else around him, arming them and barring the front door after people came in and identified the attackers as a raiding party of frost giants from Jotunheim . Whether he survived the battle or not was unknown.</p>
