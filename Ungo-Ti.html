<p>Ungo-Ti was a member of the Order of the Snake in Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ungo-Ti wandered the peninsula searching for clues about a reemergence of the Order of the Mouse and promising candidates to join the Snakes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , Ungo-Ti was discovered in the village of Awajiga in Fochu Peninsula. He posed as one of the workers on the canal that the local shoya Ginoyo Yashishira had ordered built.</p>
<p>He sensed that some people of the foreign adventuring party that accompanied Osari Minhiro housed the souls of the Mouses. So he devised a trap for them in Awajiga, by sending a dream to the non-Mouse adventurers, plotting to destroy the people housing the Mouses and recruiting the others.</p>
<p>His plan backfired because the party was too united and he escaped from Awajiga in order to find Snake reinforcements.</p>
