<p>Argenachs were a subspecies of rilmani .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Argenachs were tall, slender humanoids with a silvery sheen to their skin. Like all rilmani, their eyes emitted a pearly light. On their home plane they typically dressed in flowing robes of a white hue.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Argenachs were incredibly intelligent and resourceful.</p>
<p>Out of all the rilmani, they were the most interested in the affairs of the countless worlds on the Prime Material plane . They believing that the war between opposing forces of good and evil , law and chaos , would be fought and won on the Prime Material.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite their appearance, argenachs were very strong and had dense hides that could only be harmed by weapons with a +3 or greater enchantment .</p>
<p>Argenachs possessed a number of innate spell -like abilities, which they could use one at a time. These included advanced illusion , detect invisibility , detect magic , ESP , fly , hallucinatory terrain , invisibility , mass charm , mirror image , slow , solid fog , suggestion , and wall of fire . Once per week they could cast geas , three times per day they could cast cone of cold , and once per day they could cast legend lore and prismatic spray .</p>
<p>Their more unique spell-like abilities included lay on hands once per day, replicating the effects of heal , opening a gate once per day to bring either four ferrumachs or another argenach to their aid, and shooting two rays of silvery light from their hands, out to a range of 60 yards (55 meters), that always struck as an energy form that their target was weak to.</p>
<p>They could also cast a number of spells that were known to all rilmani — darkness , dismissal , continual light , hold monster , and teleport without error . They always had the spell know alignment active.</p>
<p>Like all rilmani, they could freely travel to the Astral plane or any of the Outer Planes , but their access to the Prime Material plane was restricted. They were only capable of traveling there if a creature of law or chaos of equal power was already present.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Argenachs avoided physical combat when possible, using their spell-like powers of charm , illusion , and suggestion to avoid such confrontations. When forced to engage someone in close quarters, they typically fought with long-handled axes and wide-bladed broadswords with +3 enchantments .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>In the hierarchy of rilmani society the argenachs were above all but the aurumachs , who they answered directly to, and were the most reclusive. They were usually only given broad guidelines, rather than specific orders, such as "There's trouble on Toril . Deal with it."</p>
<p>They acted as advisers and agitators, entrusted with the most delicate and subtle aspect of the rilmani's grander purpose — the careful adjustment of the Balance, especially in places where it couldn't fix itself, making sure that no one side gained the upper hand for long.</p>
<p>When getting involved in matters of balance the argenachs took a subtle approach and neutral role. They would conceal their true identity, then give advice and knowledge to whatever side was threatened.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Like all rilmani, the home of argenachs was near the Spire in the Outlands . However, they spent a lot of their time on the Prime Material plane.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR , an argenach was living in Westgate , acting as part of the staff of the Blais House inn.</p>
