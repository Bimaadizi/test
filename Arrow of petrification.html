<p>Arrows of petrification were enchanted arrows that could turn their targets to stone.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon impact, arrows of petrification acted as a powerful version of the flesh to stone spell, petrifying creatures vulnerable to such magics.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These enchanted arrows were famously wielded by Bliney Granter, a renowned basilisk hunter. He shot the missiles at his prey to either slow them down or petrify them, then finishing them up close with the Shattermaster , his enchanted hammer . Bliney Granter's career ended ironically, when he accidentally pricked his finger on an arrow of petrification . His petrified remains were later proudly displayed in the Granter widow's manor courtyard.</p>
