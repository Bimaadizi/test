<p>Brother Wellan was a novice monk from the Rosymorn Monastery in the Western Heartlands , who died in the late 15 th century DR during the monastery's fall to the githyanki invaders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brother Wellan's place in history was solidified thanks to his journal that detailed the githyanki attack on Rosymorn Monastery in or shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . According to Wellan's writings, the goth attacked at dawn. Several survivors of the attack, including the novice, managed to barricade themselves within a monastery room protected by a summoned guardian of faith . The invaders failed to break through the barricaded door and, with time, went quiet. The survivors were not sure if the attack was over and the githyanki were gone. Soon, that hope for salvation was crushed with a goth warrior jumping into the room through a window, only to be cut down by the guardian of faith . Brother Wellan started hatching an escape plan through the now-broken window, but it was not to be. Shortly after, they were incinerated by a githyanki's dragon , leaving behind only skeletons. Brother Wellan's book was charred and remained in the room with the guardian of faith in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery as of 1492 DR.</p>
