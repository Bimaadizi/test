<p>Isis , ( pronounced : /ˈ aɪ s ɪ s / EYE-sis ) known as Isharia in Thay and as Ishtar in Unther , was a deity of the Mulhorandi pantheon . She was a kind goddess who took joy in revealing new discoveries to her followers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Isis appeared as a Mulan woman in a white linen dress and sandals . She also wore an ornate headdress and jewelry.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Isis could fly and communicate with other members of the Mulhorandi pantheon over great distances. Her voice charmed those who heard it, and her will could stun those around her. She could harm her enemies with a simple touch. Those who had known the love of another could not harm the Lady of all Love.</p>
<h3>Manifestations</h3>
<p>Isis's will was often demonstrated through nature and the actions of white creatures and animals, such as unicorns , rabbits , and hawks . When pleased, Isis might appear as a peaceful rain. When angry, she would take the form of a storm. Isis might appear in a flow of running water to make her wisdom known or visit and bless two lovers. Isis might appear as a tree that grew and disappeared in the length of a single day, signaling the start of the growing season. She might appear before a warrior facing great odds in her service, bestowing upon the man a single kiss.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology Isis was said to have two divine realms , one in Amoria known as Quietude and one in Heliopolis known as Gizekhtet , while in the World Tree cosmology she was said to have only the divine realm in Heliopolis.</p>
<p>To those who believed in the Great Wheel cosmology, Isis was said to only come to Quietude during the spring season in Mulhorand, in order to overseer the course of that nation's rivers and its conditions for planting. Towards the end of summer, she would return to her spouse in Heliopolis. However, of the two she seemed to prefer Quietude for its research value.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Isis was the daughter of Geb and Nut . She was the sister of Thoth and wife of Osiris, as well as the mother of Horus (later Horus-Re ). Isis and Nephthys were twins.</p>
<p>The non-evil members of the Mulhorandi pantheon were allies of Isis, as was Sharess . The Bountiful Lady considered Chauntea a confidant and friend.</p>
<p>Due to their similar portfolios and differing alignments, Isis often found herself in conflict with Sebek .</p>
<p>Outside of the Mulhorandi deities, she was on mildly good terms with Mystra and in opposition to the goddess Shar , being opposed to all usage of the Shadow Weave .</p>
