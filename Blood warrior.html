<p>Blood warriors were previously living human fighters of the Moonshae Isles who had been transformed into powerful undead warriors through the dark magic of Kazgaroth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blood warriors were similar in appearance to decaying zombies , but with burning red eyes and armed with weapons .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>They were extremely bloodthirsty, absolutely loyal to Kazgaroth, and had unwavering morale.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Much like vampires , blood warriors had to kill to preserve their unholy vitality. For each week that went by without taking a life, the warriors lost more of their essence until they died or regained it through slaughter. They also had the ability to fight under the benefit of a haste spell. In order to receive this power, the blood warrior leader had to perform a dark ritual involving human or demihuman sacrifice and then bless his soldiers with the spilled blood of the victim.</p>
<p>As undead creatures, the blood warriors were immune to the aging brought on by the haste .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A unit of blood warriors consisted of 50â€“500 soldiers under a leader, all of whom were under Kazgaroth's control. Kazgaroth could form one of these units every time he came out of hibernation to spread terror and destruction throughout the Moonshaes. He did this via a corruptive mass charm that transformed a living contingent of soldiers into his blood warriors, although this power could only succeed if the troops already had a strong commander who could enact Kazgoroth's will.</p>
