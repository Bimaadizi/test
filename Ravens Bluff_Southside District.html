<p>The Southside District of Ravens Bluff encompassed the southern portion of the city, which, with the exception of the Shutters neighborhood of Crow's End , was separated from the other districts and wards by the Fire River .</p>
<p>It was a diverse region, of both affluence and poverty, that housed a number of important landmarks. Among these were the Ministry of Art , as well as the surrounding residences of its arcane ministers.</p>
<h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
<h3>Pumpside</h3>
<p>Located in the southeastern corner of the city, this neighborhood was somehow both prosperous and poor at the same time. While its streets were lined with rows of unremarkable houses and a few notable business, it housed a particularly eclectic handful of landmarks, which included the palatial Magestrand Manor as well as the imposing temple-estate of Tempus known as the House of War .</p>
<h3>Tlasbras</h3>
<p>The streets surrounding the famous Ministry of Art held some of the district's finer buildings and establishments. The Tlasbras neighborhood had a number of impressive manors and charming shops that served the wizards and sorcerers of Ravens Bluff. It was named after the half-elf adventurer that saved the city in its early days, from a horde of orcs that came down from the Earthfast Mountains .</p>
<h3>Stormrime</h3>
<p>While it was less prosperous than its neighbor to the east, it was home to flourishing businesses, well-to-do mercantile houses and grand mansions. Among these interesting sights was a shop that specialized in the sale of and care for exotic pets and familiars , an academy that offered weapon-and-martial-combat training, and an Ilmatari orphanage that cared for the sick and suffering children of the Bluff that would otherwise be left to fend for themselves on the streets.</p>
