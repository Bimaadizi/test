<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maezra was the leader of the Cult of the Dragon cell that returned to the Vale of the Dragon Oracle in the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR to rebuild their power base. Her cell was joined by a number of necrophants in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , and they built the Chantry of St. Sammaster. She took one room for herself.</p>
<p>By 1370Â DR , the Chantry was used as the place to collect and reassemble the bones of the dracolich Aghazstamn . On the same year, Maezra took it upon herself to try and entice the red dragon Nevalarich into joining the Cult. To this end, she gathered vast treasures before setting off, with half of her cell in tow. She left her second-in-command, Saerin Fierne, to watch over the Chantry, which was attacked by Zhentarim in her absence.</p>
