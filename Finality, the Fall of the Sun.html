<p>Finality, the Fall of the Sun was a powerful short sword found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Made of adamantine , Finality could cut through almost any material. Though empowered by the vitality of the sun, the blade was turned towards death as well. It burned foes with a fierce internal flame, as well as draining vitality and simply snuffing out the life of those it struck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The blade originated in old Myth Drannor from before the Weeping War , and was originally created to honor the sun. Following the fall of the city, it was corrupted to represent the final sunset instead. It eventually made its way to an old Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins, which was then taken over by a Red Wizards of Thay strike force that sought to capture the dracolich Karliath . The extraordinary blade may have then been taken by the forces of the Cormanthor Elves when they attacked the Red Wizards while claiming the ruins.</p>
