<p>The omelet of the planes was a magical item and alleged food—purportedly an omelet —possibly invented by the mage Nimrod of Nump of the Misbegotten Realms . It seemed to be an artifact of Earth . [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was contained inside a carton of some whitish material called " styrofoam ", embossed with the logo of something called an "airline". The omelet itself was old, chewy, and tasteless, and most certainly cold.</p>
<p>It was conveniently accompanied by a wax-coated paper bag.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It was an omelet.</p>
<p>If someone actually dared to eat it, they would need to show some strong intestinal fortitude or else be forced to use the paper bag.</p>
<p>Curiously, if someone actually did succeed in eating it, on the very next day the box would be found to contain an identical, if not the exact same, omelet. It wasn't any better. This was apparently normal for airline food.</p>
<p>If not eaten, the omelet of the planes only got worse with time.</p>
<h2>Value</h2>
<p>It was valued at either 5,000 gp or 6 gp or less.</p>
