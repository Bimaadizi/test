<p>Logi was a fire giant in Jotunheim , the land of giants in the plane of Ysgard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in the Great Wheel cosmology in search of the legendary Well of Mimir , having been instructed by the city's Ministry of Art to do so in order to learn how a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine could be destroyed. While in traveling in Jotunheim they met Habrok Icecaster and, after proving their worth to him by slaying a bulette , he brought them to the beer-hall Okalnir . Sensing the hall's giants were indifferent towards the adventurers, the hall's proprietor Brimir proposed a contest of four tests. He was even willing to wager three magic items if the adventurers would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a Svartalfheim cloak , a horn of Valhalla , and a great war maul known as Grungir's hammer .</p>
<p>Logi, who was visiting Okalnir at the time, was chosen as the giant champion of eating. In the first of four tests, they competed to be the first to reach the middle of a 10 feet (3 meters) long trencher filled with stew.</p>
