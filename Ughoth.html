<p>Lord Ughoth was the leader of a fomorian alliance from the Underdark beneath the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles during the late 1470s DR . He was killed by the Knights of Synnoria .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was 11 feet (3.4 meters) tall, making him average height for a fomorian, with black hair tied back in a braid. As with all fomorians, his right eye was a bulging "evil eye" that glowed with magic , but it was comparatively quite small to the point where his eyes were almost the same size. This made him look almost handsome, even to non-fomorians.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was well-mannered and diplomatic. He was a deadly combatant, but did not fight to kill if he did not need to.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lord Ughoth was born as a prince into one of the nine royal families of fomorians who lived beneath the Winterglen forest of Gwynneth, and his father operated multiple estates within his underground domain. Their family sigil was a red torch grasped by a purple arm, which was displayed upon Ughoth's army's banners. His forces consisted of fomorians but mostly of cyclopes , with whom he could communicate from great distances.</p>
<p>He deeply loved his childhood sweetheart, Marabaldia , although the pair were awkward together and never consummated their relationship before his untimely death. He bore a great anger at the le Shay rulers of Sarifal for betraying him and kidnapping Marabaldia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was still young, Ughoth fell in love with a princess of the royal family of a rival tribe, Marabaldia. Although they set a date for their wedding in the late 1460s DR, the plans were dashed when Marabaldia's estranged father attempted to force her to marry an older, richer fomorian. The young couple felt they had no choice but to flee, and despite being chased all the way, they eventually arrived at the surface within Citadel Umbra , where the le Shay prince of Sarifal, Araithe , appeared to welcome them. However, he soon betrayed them, imprisoning Marabaldia and selling Ughoth to his pursuers.</p>
<p>Marabaldia was held as a political prisoner for ten years, and during that time, Ughoth was kept busy tending to his father's estates. It was not until the late 1470s DR—following the death of both his and Marabaldia's fathers—that Ughoth took up a leadership role and managed to unite the armies of the nine tribes to march on Sarifal and punish the le Shay for their insults against one of the nine royal families.</p>
<p>The le Shay had also made enemies among the Llewyrr of the Knights of Synnoria and the humans of the Winterglen Claw , and so Lord Ughoth came together with them at Harrowfast in the Cambro Mountains to discuss the possibility of alliance. At the same time, Lord Mindarion of the Knights of Synnoria and Captain Rurik of the Winterglen Claw managed to rescue Marabaldia after she escaped from prison with the help of a gnome named Suka . The former lovers were reunited at Harrowfast, with him claiming to have never stopped thinking about her and she having believed him long dead. Ughoth gifted Marabaldia a slave -made brooch of gold braids inlaid with pearls as a sign of his affection, although she was unsure whether it was a true sign that he had missed her. Despite her misgivings, the pair tentatively renewed their courtship amidst the backdrop of military negotiations.</p>
<p>The possibility of an alliance quickly faded as it became clear that the Llewyrr despised both the fomorians and the humans, and that they did not wish to overthrow the le Shay entirely but to put a different le Shay, Lady Amaranth , on the throne, which both Captian Rurik and Prince Ughoth found unacceptable. The alliance then truly fell apart after Captain Rurik and Suka accidentally trespassed into the Llewyrr valley of Synnoria and killed three elves while fleeing imprisonment. When Lord Askepel of the Knights of Synnoria attempted to capture Ughoth and Marabaldia after Marabaldia refused to surrender Suka to them, Ughoth fought them off. The fomorians managed to escape Harrowfast into the Underdark, where Ughoth, despite great injuries, helped to carry his badly wounded companions and rallied his remaining fomorian and cyclopian forces to follow them. As they fled, he grew slower and weaker until he finally succumbed to his injuries.</p>
