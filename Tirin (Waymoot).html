<p>Tirin was a successful horse breeder from the forest town of Waymoot in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Tirin was a well-known horse breeder whose farm stood on the western edge of Waymoot. Tirin made much coin by purchasing tired and blown dray-horses from travelers who rushed along Calantar's Way for cheap and sold them replacements at twice the price. In 1348 DR, perfume merchant Peraegh Omliskur sold his beasts of burden to Tirin at a loss, trying to move quickly to his next destination. Unbeknownst to all, the murderous Zhentarim agent Horaundoon , the Eater-of-Mantles, disguised as a wrinkled old man, hitched a ride with Peraegh's cart pulled by Tirin's horses.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Tirin still offered quality horses, but his services were nowhere as popular as those of Llamskir , whose farm was across the road from Tirin's.</p>
