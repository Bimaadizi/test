<p>Shadowlight oil was a slow-burning oil infused with the essence or fabric of the Plane of Shadow . When burned, it gave off a dim, shadowy light.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A 1-pint flask of shadowlight oil weighed 1 pound (450 grams) and was valued at 5 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Functioning like regular lamp oil in most respects, shadowlight oil could be burned in any typical lamp , lantern , or other similar light source. Although its light was dim and never fully bright, it extended twice as far as the light of regular oil. For example, if a basic lamp burning regular oil illuminated to a distance of 15 feet (4.5 meters) and half-illumination to 30 feet (9 meters), such a lamp burning shadowlight oil produced half-illumination to 60 feet (18 meters). This was surprisingly useful on the Plane of Shadow: natural light sources were halved in range, but a shadowlight oil lamp was not.</p>
<p>It was also a slow-burning oil, with one pint lasting for 12 hours.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Shadowlight oil could be created by a master alchemist.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , shadowlight oil was used by cultists of Shar to light lamps and lanterns at their hideout in the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp . They also used it light beacons through the Shadow Swamp .</p>
