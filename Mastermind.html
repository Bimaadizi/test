<p>Masterminds were exceptionally cunning rogues that dealt in information and secrets over more tangible riches. Their careers were marked by lies, deceit, and most of all, intrigue.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These individuals often worked as royal courtiers or even spies, petitioning themselves among seats of power throughout the Realms in order to gain access to the most valuable information.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Due to their exceptional proficiency with managing social situations, masterminds were considered formidable opponents in the political landscape.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Masterminds trained themselves in the use of disguise and forgery kits , in order to mask their identities and obfuscate their actions.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These rogues studied hard to master numerous languages of the Realms and beyond. They even developed techniques to imitate foreign accents and individual speech patterns of others.</p>
<p>They were quick studies of character, and could glean useful information about someone through observation or a brief dialogue. Masterminds could rapidly assess the strengths or weaknesses of anyone's character in this manner.</p>
<p>While they were not the most fearsome combatants on their own, masterminds expertly assisted their allies in battle. By misdirecting their opponents, these rogues could redirect targeted attacks towards others nearby.</p>
<p>Expert masterminds honed their mental fortitude to the point where it could not be pierced by telepathy or other magical means, unless they so wished. Any lies or deceit they spread were similarly undetectable, unless they again wished otherwise.</p>
