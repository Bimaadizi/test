<p>Goldline , also called cacoxenite , was the name given to varieties of quartz with lines of gold-colored goethite (an impurity similar to iron oxide) embedded in the matrix.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These quartz ornamental stones could be amethyst , citrine , or smoky quartz with bright yellow strands or tufts of goethite running through it in parallel lines. They were typically tumbled or cut cabochon . Specimens could be two to three inches (five to eight centimeters) in diameter. Sometimes large pieces were found, but these were often subject to breakage during transportation. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Goldline had a use in enchanting metal-bladed weapons. It was held in an open flame while the appropriate spells were cast, consuming the stone and giving a plain knife, sword, or dagger a small bonus. Fortunately, greenstones were relatively common and easy to obtain.</p>
