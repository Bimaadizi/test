<p>Desedrak was an officer serving within the Flaming Fist mercenary company during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1364 DR , Desedrak, along with Scar , Bellan , Yulimtul and some 500 Fist members, sailed out from Lantan for a journey in search of the fabled resting place of the legendary explorer Balduran in the lands of Anchorome . While they were nearly halted by early disasters, they eventually landed in the seaside city of Helmsport on the continent of Maztica .</p>
<p>The group split within the city, with Desedrak and Yulimtul embarking overland northwest across the continent, with over 200 Flaming Fist mercenaries. They traveled in search of the legendary City of Gold but disappeared into the wild lands west of the Trackless Sea and were never heard from again, unreachable even by magical means.</p>
