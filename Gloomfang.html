<p>Gloomfang was a shadow dragon in service of the Order of the Crippled Fang that ravaged the Moonsea in 1373 DR in a plot to destroy the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gloomfang emanated a sickening carnal stench. Her giant maw was filled with blood-stained teeth. She spoke in sinister, sibilant whispers. The dragon felt superiority over humanoids and was not used to her meals to talk back. Some especially strong humanoids intrigued her.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gloomfang carried a lesser pale blue ioun stone that further increased her great strength.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Bane 's resurrection in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Cyric's High Priest Gormstadd returned to worshiping his old deity, transitioning the Dark God Reformed temple to its Banite roots. This greatly dissatisfied the Mad God, as the following year, the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR brought the Order of the Crippled Fang upon the Moonsea, a mysterious cult associated with Cyric. Gloomfang was contacted by the cult's leader, archmade Maganus and offered an alliance, a feast, and treasures in exchange for her to hunt down and consume soldiers of the Zhentarim that patrolled the Shind Road and stop reinforcements to arrive as the cult's summoned fiends ravaged the town of Voonlar . Despite Gloomfang's hatred for Crippled Fang and her undead state, the shadow dragon was seduced by the promise of great riches.</p>
<p>The attack on Voonlar was stopped with the help of the Hero of Daggerford and his allies. As the adventurers moved east along the fiend-infested Shind Road, Gloomfang descended on the group and eventually was slain.</p>
