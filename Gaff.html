<p>Gaffs , otherwise known as hooks , were a type of tool used by both fishermen and sailors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gaffs typically used by fishermen consisted of a metal hook with a crossbar at the base, made of either metal or wood. When wielded, the hook would protrude between a user's middle and ring fingers. Those utilized by sailors were often attached to a pole that was 10​ to ​20 feet (3​ to ​6.1 meters) in length.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Fishermen used the one-handed form of gaff to hook and land fish. The pole-attached version was primarily used by sailors to pull their craft to a dock or another ship. They were also used to rescue cargo or men that fell overboard.</p>
<p>Besides these intended uses, gaffs were occasionally improvised as a sort of piercing weapon that was difficult to disarm. And for sailors who lost their hands, gaffs were often attached to a wooden cup for use as a prosthetic replacement.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>These tools were typically available for purchase wherever fishing was conducted.</p>
