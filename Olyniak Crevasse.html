<p>The Olyniak Crevasse was a crevasse located in the Nakvaligach region within the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Olyniak Crevasse was truly massive. At 60 miles (97 kilometers) in width and several dozens miles deep, it was the largest crevasse in the Great Glacier. It was surrounded by the highest mountains in Nakvaligach. A layer of fluorescent minerals 200 feet (61 meters) down illuminated the crevasse at night, giving off a faint green light.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −212 DR , the white dragon Ufloq awoke in its lair located within the crevasse. Several dozen Nakulutiun witnessed the event, attracted to the crevasse by the loud rumbling. Many were promptly devoured by the hungry dragon. This is the only recorded sighting of Ufloq.</p>
