<p>Melkerech was a malevolent lich that was an old rival of Adzerak . He regularly spied upon Barrenstone with divination spells, waiting for an opportunity to seize its treasures, particularly the books. When Adzerak was destroyed and Barrenstone was looted in 1369 DR , he began devoting his efforts to tracking down the adventurers and recovering "his" books.</p>
