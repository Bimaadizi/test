<h2>History</h2>
<p>Known as perhaps one of the first masters of metamagic, and an apprentice of Faerdinalar the Enchanter, Thornar was foremost amongst the mages who fought Isilger Mountrant and finally slew him. Thornar created many artifacts and constructs, working extensively on magical barriers and their breaching; he aided many wizards with their magic-related problems, and never asked for a price; none of those he aided feared he may work against them.</p>
<p>He was finally slain when a longtime rival, Uldinus Lawkland , dropped on him a parapet which carried an antimagic field . As the field prevented his contingencies from acting, it killed him.</p>
