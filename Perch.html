<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Treeclaw lizards were not especially strong, but they could be used as guardians, they could glide, and they were extremely nimble and fast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Perch was already Berun's companion by Tarsakh 14 of 1374Â DR . The lizard was instrumental to his initial distraction of Taaki , Sauk 's arumwon , which eventually led to Berun's own capture. The lizard was later instrumental to his escape from Sauk's group. After Berun was separated from Lewan by a shambling mound , Perch was instrumental to nursing him back to health, by bringing him eggs to eat. The lizard was also instrumental to distracting the guards in the Fortress of the Old Man . Perch slew Taaki on the night of Tarsakh 25 , after being swallowed whole. The lizard continued to fight afterwards, but its utility was limited against the Old Man of the Mountain . The lizard survived its master that night; Lewan carried it outside of the tower.</p>
