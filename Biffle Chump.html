<p>Biffle Chump was a drow man, who, allegedly, was trapped in the stomach of Lolth 's avatar alongside Jan Jansen , an adventurer and a turnip aficianado, who lived in Athkatla during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Jan Jansen's highly trustworthy story, he was swallowed by Lolth's avatar sometime before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . He was stuck in the deity's stomach for days alongside a miserable drow named Biffle Chump. Jansen claimed he had to eat Biffle Chump to survive, and he tasted like chicken .</p>
<p>It was likely that Biffle Chump never existed in the first place.</p>
