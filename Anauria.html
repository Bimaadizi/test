<p>Anauria was one of a small number of enclaves that survived the fall of ancient Netheril . It grew into a great kingdom and the wealthiest of the Netherese survivor states before eventually being swallowed up by the growing Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Anauria was one of Netheril's famed flying cities. It was famous for the craftsmanship of its swords and for its magic, and after the fall of Netheril, it became the richest of the three surviving states, collectively known as the Lost Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The cities of Anauria were located in the area of north Faerûn that was later known as the Sword , the southern region of the great Anauroch desert. Using landmarks from the Era of Upheaval , Anauria stretched from the Serpent Hills to the west, as far east as the Desertsmouth Mountains , and even the Stonelands .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>While Anauria was a human -ruled kingdom, its greatest ruler was King Thausimbel "The Wise" a great man of elven blood who ruled for over three and a half centuries.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Karsus's Folly in −339 DR , the goddess Mystra was able to slow the fall of Anauria so that it could settle safely on the earth. The city–along with Asram and Hlondath –then survived for hundreds of years before the desert finally encompassed it.</p>
<p>At some point during its history, wizards of Anauria working alongside their fellows from Asram discovered the kingdom known as the Cloudlands , high in the skies above the Stonelands of Faerûn. Anauria and Asram sought to conquer the realm, in order to escape the encroachment of the growing Great Sand Sea , but wound up destroying it in the process.</p>
<p>According to most scholars the kingdom fell in the Year of Fallen Guards, 111 DR , when it was sacked by a horde of orcs . The exact timeline of this event is not entirely clear, as some state its destruction took place in 200 DR , while others state it lasted as long as 450 DR .</p>
<p>After the kingdom collapsed, its scattered few survivors traveled east to the region of the Moonsea and later-day Cormyr . The Marsh Drovers of the Farsea Marshes were perhaps the most notable descendants of the Anaurian people.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some historians speculated that Anauria and Hlondath had suffered greatly from a dracorage at some point in their respective histories.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Lost Kingdom of Anauria was inhabited by humans, elves , and half-elves . Those among the upper classes enjoyed such diversions as hunting, and the lower classes produced vast quantities of grain to export to the lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>The noble houses of Anauria included House Maluradek , House Nemrin , the elven houses of Nyntynel and Olyrnn , and the royal family of House Thardresk .</p>
