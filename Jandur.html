<p>Jandur was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point after spring started in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Red Wizard Harnrim Starangh assaulted the armory of the sanctum where Vangerdahast dwelt after his retirement as Royal Mage of Cormyr . In doing so, he slew three mages: one with a slaying-snake spell, another by twisting his shielding magic against himself into a paralyzing field, and a third with staeradder poison. He fled after using a spell that burned out all recollections from their minds, preventing their dead bodies from responding to any questioning.</p>
<p>Darthym reported Jandur as dead to the War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur , a fellow War Wizard working in the sanctum.</p>
