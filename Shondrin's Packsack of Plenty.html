<p>Shondrin's Packsack of Plenty , or simply The Sack , was a general store in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was run by Shondrin .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the northern side of the road known as the Rise, between Belvyn's House of Good Cheer and Ruldarr's Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Small and jam-packed, the shop sold all sorts of things, including dry goods and an assortment of practical supplies, like candles , rope , and outerwear clothing. Prices were slightly above the average market price and Shondrin occasionally accepted items in trade, which he sold in the store. Hence, it included some secondhand items such as hardware and old armor and weaponry. If Shondrin didn't have what a customer wanted in stock, he could tell them the nearest place they could find it.</p>
<p>While Shondrin rarely dealt in enchanted items , they did turn up from time to time, apparently misidentified. Volothamp Geddarm once discovered a bag of holding shaped to resemble a statuette of a fat dragon , the head of which swung back to reveal the opening; it was later sold. There were also tales of travelers purchasing a seemingly mundane old sword , only to find it enchanted and possessing unexpected powers.</p>
