<p>Erlum was a Neverwintan soldier stationed in the Leilon garrison in the High Tower of Thalivar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Leilon was resettled in the late 15 th century DR, Dagult Neverember sent some of Neverwinter's soldiers to defend the settlers during the town's reconstruction. Erlum was among these soldiers, serving under Sergeant Hazz Yorrum 's command. The High Tower of Thalivar acted as a garrison for the soldiers. However, it turned out that the wizard tower was haunted by the ghost of Thalivar . The wizard's spirit drove away Erlum, Yorrum and two other soldiers ( Gori and Koz ). However, the town mage Gallio Elibro refused to leave. The soldiers had recently noticed Gallio's odd behavior but they were unaware that Thalivar's ghost took possession of the mage every night. A group of adventurers took care of the ghost.</p>
