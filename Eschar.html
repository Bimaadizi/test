<p>Eschar was a powerful demon bound by the Nar demonbinders of Narfell beneath Dun-Tharos to guard the Sighing Vault .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eschar resembled an immense ogre with red skin and a crown of horns. He spoke with a brutish, hollow voice. His skin was scaled, and his horns radiated with fiendish witchlight; his body pulsed with evil power.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Unlike other demons, Eschar actually relished the conditions of his binding. He was still bloodthirsty, ferocious, and proud.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Eschar was mainly a physical fighter, swinging fists and clawed feet. He commanded other demons, being able to freeze even the servants of the Queen Abiding by commanding them. He was also capable of teleporting himself from place to place, even outside of the Sighing Vault from time to time. He could breathe out a white-hot flame, and his roars could disrupt spells by sheer force.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Until 1373 DR, Eschar guarded the Sighing Vault in Dun-Tharos, particularly from the servants of the Queen Abiding , but he did not do so very closely. He remained in Dun-Tharos after it was breached.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eschar was originally bound by the Nar to guard the Sighing Vault. At one point, after the Rotting Man discarded the Queen Abiding's token of control, Eschar took it to the Sighing Vault.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Eschar fought Marrec and his party to prevent them from entering the Sighing Vault. They ultimately succeeded, releasing the Queen Abiding. The Queen immediately captured Eschar and began to digest him in order to punish him for his past defiance.</p>
<p>However, Eschar somehow managed to survive and remained in Dun-Tharos as of 1479Â DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Other demons similar to Eschar, but smaller and misshapen, were in Dun-Tharos close to his location.</p>
