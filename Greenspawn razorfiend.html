<p>Greenspawn razorfiends , also called harrowblades by wood elves and other forest dwellers, were cunning, voracious dragonspawn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greenspawn razorfiends were large creatures, standing 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall at the shoulder and as much as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in length. On average, adults weighed 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilograms) Greenspawn razorfiend scales were a dirty green color that helped them blend in with forest pools. These dragonspawns' wings were useless for flight, but were razor-sharp and resembled knife blades when folded.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Greenspawn razorfiends were among the first spawn created by Tiamat , and they were used as guards in her armies. Razorfiends were also placed in select regions to harass settlements and travelers.</p>
<p>Greenspawn razorfiends were cunning hunters that enjoyed the killing of prey as much as the hunt. They preferred to live in warm or temperate forests and marshes, such as Chondalwood and the Vast Swamp . While hunting, greenspawn razorfiends would hide in water or undergrowth before attacking.</p>
<p>Like some other dragonspawn, greenspawn razorfiends were capable of procreating on their own. A pair of razorfiends mated for life, and the female would lay three to six eggs every year. Mates then took turns hunting and guarding the nest.</p>
