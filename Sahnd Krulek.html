<p>Sahnd Krulek was a bandit leader in the Moonsea in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sahnd was a Knight of the Black Fist in Phlan . However, a day after arresting a powerful noble, he was framed and later sentenced to death, having been falsely accused of plotting to assassinate Lord Regent Ector Brahms . A group of fellow Black Fists, knowing Krulek's innocence, secretly freed him and spirited him away from the city.</p>
<p>In order to get vengeance against the noble, Sahnd founded the Gray Patriots bandit group. Initially, they tried to act honorably and not harm innocent people, but they occasionally descended into barbarity.</p>
<p>In 1489 DR, another bandit group arrived in the area, the Claws of Tiamat led by the sorcerer Jeralla . Sahnd offered to meet with her in order to negotiate an alliance. However, the meeting was attacked by both a warband of the Cult of the Dragon , which wanted to kill the heretical Jeralla, and by an adventuring party hired to clear the Iron Route of outlaws. In the fighting, Sahnd was defeated.</p>
<p>Around 1492 DR he was in jail on Phlan when the reclamation army led by Jhessail Greycastle attacked the city. Some adventurers tried to recruit him for the battle.</p>
