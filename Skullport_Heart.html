<p>The Heart was one of the four wards of the subterranean city of Skullport . It was located in the easternmost portion of Skullport's main cavern. It was the highest-class area in Skullport and housed the bulk of Skullport's population.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Heart consisted of three levels: Upper Heart, Central Heart, and Lower Heart. The Heart was home to most of Skullport's permanent residents and held some businesses. The Heart had a less finished look compared to the rest of Skullport and was marked by stone columns and stalactites. Duergar , illithids , drow , and beholders preferred to live in the Heart for its resemblance to a natural cave, its shadowy recesses, and the darkness of its upper areas.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1492 DR , the Xanathar controlled Skullport and turned the city into a haven for its criminal organization . Under its rule, most local businesses were shut down, with the few remaining in business paying it protection money. Skullport's only remaining inn, Guts and Garters , and restaurant, the Worm's Gullet , were located in the Heart.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Lower Heart</h3>
<p>Lower Heart was paved with cobblestones and large slabs of stone. Most of the buildings were in better shape than the rest of Skullport. Lower Heart had many unusual structures and landmarks, many predating the founding of Skullport and appearing dwarven or human in origin. There were few street names aside from Illithid Way, with most locals navigating by landmarks and businesses.</p>
<p>Notable locations included:</p>
<h3>Central Heart</h3>
<p>Central Heart was primarily a residential area, housing some of the more influential and wealthy locals. The catwalks and rope bridges that cluttered the skyline were sturdier than elsewhere in Skullport, allowing most of the heaviest races free access.</p>
<p>Notable locations:</p>
<h3>Upper Heart</h3>
<p>Upper Heart was the darkest area of Skullport, with only occasional illumination from patches of glowing fungus. The ceiling of Skullport's cavern rose to its highest point in Upper Heart, with structures twining stalactites 300 feet above the cavern floor. The largest number of Skullport's darkness-loving races lived and did business in Upper Heart.</p>
