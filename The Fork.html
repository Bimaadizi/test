<p>The Fork was the spot where the Fork Road from Sundabar split to go north along the Adbar Road towards Citadel Adbar , and east along an unnamed path toward Ascore .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The lonely and wild spot seemed like the end of Faer√ªn , splitting toward the dwarfholds of the Ice Mountains , and the nameless track heading east to the ruins of Ascore . Few traveled the way, but the gnomes of Graevelwood sometimes used the road.</p>
