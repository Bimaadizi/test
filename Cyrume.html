<p>Cyrume was a potter in Yhaunn who was secretly a member of the temple of Shar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In early Eleasis of 1373 DR , he was sent on a mission by Variance Amatick to poison Stonecutter's Well in the Stiltways , the goal being to cause the Selûnites of Moonshadow Hall to become fearful of a Sharran cell in the city, as well as spread general chaos and death.</p>
<p>Before he could complete his task, he was caught by the priestess Feena Archwood , who ambushed him in her werewolf hybrid form. Knowing that escape was impossible, he chose to drink the flask of poison, dying in seconds while glorifying Shar .</p>
<p>While Feena took the empty flask as proof of a Sharran presence in the city, Variance stripped Cyrume's corpse of its holy symbol of Shar and summoned a shadow mastiff to savagely maul it. By the next day, the city was filled with rumors of a werewolf devouring innocents, and Cyrume was remembered as an unfortunate victim of the beast.</p>
