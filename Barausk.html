<p>Barausk was a type of tree that grew in Harrowdale and Deepingdale in the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It looked very similar to the beech tree and had black branches and a white trunk, and was covered in thorns 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in length.</p>
<p>The wood of the barausk tree had a dark brown hue with gray-green mottling. On closer inspection, these gray-green areas marked where the grain folded back on itself to a very tight degree. Overall, the grain resembled a maze, meatballs amongst messed-up spaghetti, or the crazed banding that occurred around burls in other woods.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>As the dense, folded grain dulled or even broke saws and blades, it could only be easily cut when green and wet, or after being soaked in water for around a day to soften. While it could be sprayed with water over a few days to achieve the same softening and enanle cutting, this was only to a depth of a finger's width, beyond which it must be sprayed again for continued cutting. Once the green wood was properly dried, barausk was as hard as iron and quite durable, but if heated it became brittle and could not be recovered. It took only 24 hours for the wood to dry until iron-hard.</p>
<p>Its wood was therefore used by many in woodworking projects. In particular, barausk wood, especially the branches, made for high-quality arrow shafts, spears , staves , and weapon hafts, and hence it was favored by hunters and soldiers. It was also used in alchemy for the extraction of silver vitriol and yellow vitriol , and in artificing and the crafting of a variety of implements for wizards , warlocks , and clerics .</p>
