<p>The Unseelie Court was the divine realm of the Queen of Air and Darkness , one of the most powerful Archfey in all the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Unseelie Court was a mirror opposite of the Seelie Court; where the latter was a place of laughter and friendship, the Unseelie Court was a place of hatred, enslavement, and death. The Court was located in an immense cavern of black stone full of stalagmites and stalactites, centered around a single mountainous stalagmite upon which the Queen's black onyx throne stood. The Black Diamond itself rested upon the throne.</p>
<p>The Unseelie Court appeared macabre and twisted to visitors: trees grew in unnatural shapes, shadows hid blood-soaked alcoves, and nightshade and blood wort plants glowed to provide the Court with haphazard red light. The throne itself was shaped like a great dragon.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>Different accounts placed the Unseelie Court either within Phlegethon , Pandemonium 's dark third layer, or within the Feywild .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There were no notable locations in the Unseelie Court beyond the throne of the Queen of Air and Darkness; no towns or other settlements were built there.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The most notable inhabitant of the Unseelie Court was the Queen of Air and Darkness; as she no longer manifested a physical form, her presence filled the cavern, emanating from the throne and Black Diamond.</p>
<p>All of the inhabitants of the Unseelie Court lived to serve the Queen. When not on missions assigned them by their queen, they typically lived around the stalagmite holding the throne. Outside of these missions, they typically had little care for or about creatures on other planes.</p>
<p>Although the majority of inhabitants were various evil or corrupted fey, any creature with even a drop of fey blood, or with useful or entertaining skills, could be welcome as well. Undead creatures were used as menial servants. Yeth hounds and hell hounds were among the favorite servants of the Queen, and more successful fey servants were sometimes rewarded with one. Specific types of fey known to live there included brambles , quicklings , spriggans , and hoary hunters .</p>
