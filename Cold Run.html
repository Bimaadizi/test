<p>The Cold Run was a large stretch of frigid tundra that ran from the mouth of the Iceflow to Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The region, which spanned from the Iceflow up to Icewind Dale, was almost always deadly cold. However, in the peak of summer, the Trackless Sea often brought fairly warm winds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long ago, part of the Cold Run was struck by either a heavy meteor strike or the lava of a volcanic eruption. This formed a huge crater, which was filled with rich ore. Miners moved in to the area and established Fireshear.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The native inhabitants of the region were the Ice Hunters . When the Northlanders arrived in the region, their expansion drove the natives even further up the Cold Run.</p>
<p>Tundra yetis were known to roam around the Cold Run, as well as wolves and reindeer .</p>
