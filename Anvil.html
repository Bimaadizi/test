<p>Anvils were an essential tool for metalworking throughout Toril . They were used by all manner of armorers, blacksmiths, jewelers, metal workers, swordsmiths, and weaponsmiths.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Anvils consisted of a large block of metal with a flattened top surface and one pointed end. This flat surface was known as the "face" and was where another object would be either struck or cut. The pointed end was referred to as the "beak" or "horn" and was used to bend bars or sheets of metal. The other end of an anvil was referred to as the "heel" or "tail" and usually had two holes within it for the purposes of other common blacksmith tools, the hardie and punch .</p>
<p>Anvils typically produced a clanging, clunking, or ringing sound whenever they were struck. A ringing sound was most preferred by dwarven smiths and those that produced a sweeter tone would fetch higher prices.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Both small- and full-sized anvils made of solid steel were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<h2>Notable Anvils</h2>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h2>Dwarven Culture</h2>
<p>With blacksmithing being a major activity for many dwarves, anvils held a significant place within both their culture and religion. The symbol of Moradin , the head of the Morndinsamman , was typically a hammer and anvil. Their ancestral legends spoke of him bestowing a hammer and anvil upon the first dwarves. Being his symbol, temples to Moradin were typically decorated with anvils. Anvils near the entrances of these temples were always struck by his priests before they surrendered any weapons they had to the temples' guards. Moradin was sometimes known to demonstrate his favor with a follower by manifesting his symbol upon an anvil after being struck by a hammer. When he wanted to demonstrate his disfavor though, he was sometimes known to cause anvils to shatter into hundreds of pieces upon being struck.</p>
<p>Worshipers of the dwarven god Marthammor Duin annually celebrated creativity on the 9th day of Highsun , a holiday they referred to as simply "the Anvil."</p>
<p>A number of dwarven clans and settlements included anvils in their coat of arms, such as Clan Ironstar , Sarphil , and Ironmaster . Other clans were known to include the word "anvil" in their name, such as the duergar clan Anvilthew , Clan Brawnanvil, and Clan Trueanvil.</p>
