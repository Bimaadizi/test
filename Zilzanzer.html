<p>Zilzanzer was a wizard creator of the ring of the gorgon who lived some years before the late 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite Zilzanzer's fame coming from the creation of the ring of the gorgon , most of his creations infamously did not perform as expected. However, one exception was Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts —tiny magical missiles that allowed the wielder to swiftly throw five darts within six seconds. Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts worked out just right and he sold a large number of them to his colleagues. Overall, Zilzanzer created a great number of these darts before his death some years before the 1281 DR .</p>
