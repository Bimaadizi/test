<p>Morwen Daggerford was the sister of the duke of Daggerford around 1485 DR and later duchess herself the following year.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Morwen usually trained with the militia and paid regular visits to the shrine of Tempus . She was the Master of Arms of the duchy and the military commander of the castle but many believed her a better duke than Maldwyn Daggerford .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1486 DR , Morwen inherited the title from Maldwyn when the practice of primogeniture was suspended in the town of Daggerford. She also joined the Lords' Alliance .</p>
<p>Not long after she began her rule, Lady Morwen was captured by Baroness Wynne Cromm and placed into the dungeon of Cromm's Hold . A succubus named Pencheska , disguised as Lady Morwen, ruled Daggerford in her stead.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>On the surface, Morwen was not an amiable person but in truth, she had a noble heart. People believed her to be a more capable leader than Maldwyn and blamed the laws or primogeniture, but Morwen was content with her position.</p>
