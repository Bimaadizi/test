<p>Shadowmail was a special set of scale armor found in the Blooded Wood in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mail was mostly black and bore a large white skull design on the chest.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though a fairly large suit of mail, it was specially designed by the eladrin to be lighter and not impede spellcasting. It also carried powerful enhancements to certain destructive elemental styles of magic, making it ideal for a flashy spellcaster.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The armor was in the 'possession' (sans wearer) of the giant spider Greenstalker , who had laired near Granwell Keep in the King's Forest . It may have been found by Harpers looking for the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll held by the Shadovar arcanists in the Keep.</p>
