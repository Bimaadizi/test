<p>Daganisoraan was a legendary ancient sahuagin baron of gigantic size and age.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After living for at least two thousand years, he grew to a height of at least 30.5 feet (9.3 meters).</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Daganisoraan spent most years hibernating in an unknown location, for as long as a decade or so at a time. When active, he went on aquatic hunts, typically preying on krakens , whales , and sharkweres . This would go on for a month, after which time he would return to hibernation.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Though content to lay dormant in his decade-long hibernation, it was believed that if ever Anguileusis , the long-dormant god of the anguillians were to return to life, then Daganisoraan would aid the sahuagins and Sekolah in the inevitable war between the two races.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daganisoraan was once the king of an unknown sahuagin realm, who exiled himself after centuries of boring rule.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Daganisoraan's long life, coupled with the centuries of self-isolation, made him a mythic figure to the sahuagin, who considered his earlier life as a king merely a distinct entity, unrelated to him save for a coincidental name. Regardless, the tales told of this creature were quite polarizing, with some casting him in a heroic light and others as a villain. The core element to all these tales was the fact he played the role of "bogeyman", sent to bring doom to the foolish and unwary.</p>
