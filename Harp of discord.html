<p>Harps of discord were harps that either caused confusion in their enemies or were cursed to act as harps of charming half the time and cause rage against the musician the other half.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Looking like any other ordinary harp, these magical instruments allowed musicians to influence their foes in battle, either for good or for ill.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The enchanted version of these harps allowed the musician to cast confusion thrice a day upon foes within 30 feet (9.1 meters).</p>
<p>The cursed version, however, would act and seem as a harp of charming , but half the time it was played it would instead emit such painful discordant tones that those within 30 feet (9.1 meters) would fly into a rage at the musician, even attempting to slay them for their offensive music. For nearly half a minute after the sound had ended, they would remain affected by this quite reasonable rage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An enchanted harp of discord was located in the lair of the wizard Mekrath in the city of Athkatla in Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
