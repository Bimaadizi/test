<p>Devlin Patchwerk was a member of the Shadow Thieves and brother of Mishad Patchwerk who resided in the stronghold within Undermountain in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Devlin Patchwerk was rude but not aggressive like many of his guild-mates. He was not the smartest person in the dungeon and could be easily misled to reveal the illusion hiding the Shadow Thieves' stronghold entrance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Devlin Patchwerk was stationed in the caves to guard the Shadow Thieves' hideout entrance. The guild was thought to be purged from Waterdeep , but in secret, they'd established a base of operations under the City of Splendors in one of the top layers of Undermountain. When the guild's return was discovered by Khelben Arunsun , he knew it was an immediate danger to the Lords of Waterdeep , and he outfitted a lone adventurer to uncover the thieves' base, marked with a holy symbol of Mask . The adventurer encountered Devlin Patchwerk standing guard, who was easily misled into revealing the stronghold entrance.</p>
