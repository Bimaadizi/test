<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bythnara studied magic under the instruction of her mother , and shared a bedroom with Liriel Baenre . Bythnara was required to kill a goblin for the Blooding coming-of-age ritual. This was considered a weak foe compared to the usually more intelligent or dangerous creatures pitted against drow in this ceremony, and she resented the teasing it brought upon her.</p>
<p>Bythnara and Liriel had a strong rivalry, having grown up together. In 1361 DR , Bythnara planned to dispose of her, so Liriel preemptively pushed Bythnara into a lake of flesh-eating pyrimo fish. Their friend Syzwick witnessed the murder but swore never to speak of it.</p>
