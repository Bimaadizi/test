<p>Berg'inyon Baenre was a drow weapon master of House Baenre of Menzoberranzan in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the youngest son to matron mother Yvonnel Baenre and had many elder sisters and brothers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Handsome even by drow standards, Berg'inyon kept his short hair finely cut.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was described as a typical drow with high ambitions and no sense of morality.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Being an elite drow soldier, Berg'inyon was skilled in the use of handling riding lizards , and armed himself with a 10-foot-long (3 meters) death lance and a hand crossbow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Berg'inyon was a classmate and rival of Drizzt Do'Urden in Melee-Magthere , where he constantly ranked second to Drizzt and never once beat him, much to his dismay and to his mother's anger. He was initially trained by his brother Dantrag .</p>
<p>After graduating Melee-Magthere, he commanded House Baenre's 400 lizard riders.</p>
<p>Later, in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR when Drizzt returned to the Underdark, Berg'inyon helped Dantrag in fighting Drizzt. But when Dantrag began to lose, Berg'inyon betrayed Dantrag and left the fight. Drizzt killed Dantrag, and Berg'inyon became the new weapon master of his house.</p>
<p>Following the drow retreat from their assault on Mithral Hall in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Berg'inyon chose to accept Jarlaxle 's offer to join Bregan D'aerthe as a lieutenant of the renegade drow band. He rationalized the instability that would likely plague House Baenre after the disastrous failed conquest of Mithral Hall and the likelihood that Triel would soon give birth to a son she would groom to replace Berg'inyon as the weapons master, which among the drow would likely mean Berg'inyon's death).</p>
<p>When Crenshinibon began to cloud Jarlaxle's judgment, Berg'inyon joined Rai-guy , and Kimmuriel Oblodra in their attempt to usurp control of Bregan D'aerthe in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR . In the ensuing conflict, Berg'inyon faced off against the human assassin Artemis Entreri in single combat with Berg'inyon desiring to fight the one considered Drizzt's equal. However, Entreri proved the better and killed Berg'inyon during the fight in the lair of the red dragon Hephaestus .</p>
