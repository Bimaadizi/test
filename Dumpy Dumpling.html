<p>Dumpy Dumpling was once the headliner performing for the Circus of the Last Days sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before their visit to Baldur's Gate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Circus of the Last Days had Dumpy Dumpling as the headliner. After performing for a decade with shows filled with firework farts, chicken -snapping, and pie -in-the-ear tricks, the passion for the art left the man. One day, during a show, Dumpy called on a volunteer. A sly man with reddish-hair stepped onto the stage. The volunteer, Norris Greenie of Baldur's Gate, seemed to have charisma enough to inspire pure joy with his command of the stage. He caused riotous laughter with his one liners and more with his witty comebacks. Not just the crowd was mesmerized by the redheaded volunteer, so was the author of Officially Unofficial History of the Circus of the Last Days! . When the show was over, the writer forgot that he was watching Dumpy Dumpling's show and not the red-headed man's. Lucretious , the proprietress of the Circus of the Last Days, quickly realized the volunteer's star quality and recruited him into her troupe. She offered him a job right there on stage to the crowd's thunderous applause. This was how Dribbles the Clown replaced Dumpy Dumpling as the star of the plane -hopping circus from the Feywild .</p>
