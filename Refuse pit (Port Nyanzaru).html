<p>The refuse pit of Port Nyanzaru , Chult was the city's garbage dump.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pit was a huge and greasy sinkhole that dominated the outskirts of the Old City outside Port Nyanzaru's western walls. The smell was intense, and even a breezy day offered no relief from the stomach-churning stench.</p>
<p>The pit was was over 100 feet (30 meters) deep and filled with a sea of festering trash, rotting flesh and bones, and rancid water. This vast amount of waste filled up to 90 feet (27 meters) of the deep pit, and while this level could rise, it never overflowed thanks to an unknown number of otyughs living and feasting deep beneath the surface of the trash. These monsters could be heard rusting through the garbage on quiet nights, but they rarely posed a threat to anyone who didn't enter the pit. Less docile were the undead that prowled the dump, including ghouls and the occasional ghast , wraith , flameskull , and spawn of Kyuss . Naturally, the dump was also home to countless vermin, including insects , rats , and ravens .</p>
<p>A passage leading to catacombs beneath the Old City's ziggurats was located in the wall of the refuse pit beneath the surface of the trash.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the refuse pit had gained an unfortunate reputation as a place where corpses were dumped, providing a steady food supply for the undead. The albino dwarf Favin Kreeger was paid by the city's criminals to hide murder victims in the dump.</p>
<p>Following the end of the death curse , a wight necromancer named Jaru Tasca acquired a piece of the Cyst , a powerful necromantic mass of flesh, and plotted to use it to transform Port Nyanzaru's residents into undead. Her minions would rise from the refuse pit to capture victims and return them to her secret base in the catacombs beneath the Old City. The number of undead in the pit soon grew and began to threaten the city.</p>
