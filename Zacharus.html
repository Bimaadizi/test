<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Bane 's resurrection in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Cyric's High Priest Gormstadd returned to worshiping his old deity, transitioning the Dark God Reformed temple to its Banite roots. This greatly dissatisfied the Mad God, as the following year, the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR brought the Order of the Crippled Fang upon the Moonsea, a mysterious cult associated with Cyric. One of the Crippled Fang's attacks fell on the city of Voonlar . An army of fiends was unleashed inside the town's walls, with the Banite clergy being their main target. Even though Voonlar was successfully defended with the aid of the Hero of Daggerford , most members of Bane's church were slain, and Gormstadd himself was incinerated inside the temple by the Zacharus, who was put in charge of the raid by the Cult's master – archmage Maganus . Zacharus and his summoned green slaadi were slain by the Hero of Daggerford during the Cult's stand in the Dark God Reformed.</p>
