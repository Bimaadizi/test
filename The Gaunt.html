<p>The Gaunt was now of the three lich -castles on the isle of Thelve in Sea of Swords , just off the shores of Candlekeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Gaunt was an impressive tall lone stronghold that menacingly loomed over Thelve. Extensive stone-cut cellars ran underneath the lich-castle.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Gaunt was a local nickname given to the keep located on the island's eastern shores. The castle was built atop a cliff to the north from a natural and unnamed harbor â€“ an inlet directly west of Candlekeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gaunt was built using the slave labor of a gnomish community that inhabited Thelve. A trio of wizards , the so-called Twilight Three , were responsible for the castle's construction and subsequent eradication of the island's gnome population. Eventually, the three mages transformed themselves into liches, and their relationships soured. One of the trio lorded over The Gaunt, while others resided in their own castles across Thelve. By the late 14 th century DR , the undead lord of the Gaunt was believed to serve Larloch , an immensely powerful lich.</p>
