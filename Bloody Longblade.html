<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Bloody Longblade was gifted to Hadrian Colton by his nobleman father as a symbolic gesture—a bastard sword for a bastard son of a serving wench. The sword was left unused for years until Hadrian Colton realized he needed to improve his sword-fighting skill to enhance his procurement career. Sword-wielding guards and their unwilling owners guarded well the many items he was targeting. Despite the Bloody Longblade being a hurtful and offensive gift, Hadrian learned to wield the deadly blade, making his career long and fruitful.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , the Bloody Longblade found its way to Daggerford where it was in the stock of Stran , the local black market trader staying at the Black Stone Inn .</p>
