<p>A pseudodragon was a small dragon -kin known to be playful.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pseudodragons typically had bodies about 1 foot (30 centimeters) long, with a 2‑foot-long (61‑centimeter) tail and weighed about 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms). They had chameleon -like abilities, though their color was usually a brownish red.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They could communicate telepathically in Common or Draconic and also through the vocalization of animal noises. While pseudodragons could bite, their main weapon was a stinging, poisonous tail.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>Their general attitude was similar to that of a small cat but with a cunning intelligence. They were wary of evil beings, but were willing to serve as a companion to another being if treated well and respected.</p>
<p>A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.</p>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>In the wild, pseudodragons often seek out quiet places to inhabit such as the hollows of trees and small caves. They are likely to be found in temperate forests.</p>
<h2>Significance</h2>
<p>They were sometimes dispatched in times of need by an array of deities including Brandobaris , Erevan Ilesere , Gond , Gwaeron Windstrom , Marthammor Duin , Mystra , and Rillifane Rallathil .</p>
<h2>Notable Pseudodragons</h2>
<p>King Haedrak Rhindaun III of Tethyr had a platinum-colored pseudodragon named Purlakhonthiis .</p>
