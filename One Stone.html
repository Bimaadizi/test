<p>One Stone was an ancestor mound for the Golden Eagle , Red Pony , and Sky Pony Uthgardt barbarian tribes of the Moonwood in the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Instead of an altar mound at the center of the cairn rings, there was a single massive boulder 20 feet (6.1 meters) across and 12 feet (3.7 meters) high and covered in precisely engraved tracery. Carved steps ascended the south face to the altar top.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>One legend told of a god who sealed a passageway from the Nine Hells with a single rock thrust into the ground. Some wonder if the evil sealed beneath the stone caused the deaths of the tribes and darker tales said the tribes dwelt under the stone within the portal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally this mound was worshiped by members of the Sky Pony , Golden Eagle, and Red Pony tribes, but for reasons unknown the latter two eventually moved on to other places. Years later, lycanthropes of Claw Hollow perpetrated sudden attacks on the Sky Pony tribe during their pilgrimage to this holy place to celebrate their ancestors. Sky Pony barbarians therefore started attacking strangers on sight.</p>
