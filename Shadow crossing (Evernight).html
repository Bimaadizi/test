<p>The shadow crossing in Neverdeath graveyard was a portal allowing for passage from Neverwinter in the Material Plane to Evernight in the Shadowfell . As of the late 15 th century DR , it was under the control of Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The portal made use of circle magic and was activated by sprinkling a special powder into an eternal flame that burned within the Neverdeath cemetery. A nearby teleportation circle granted easy access to the crossing for Valindra Shadowmantle and her apprentices.</p>
<p>Unlike the many so-called Crevices of Dusk that connected Neverwinter and Evernight, this portal was not a naturally occurring gap in reality, but rather a purposefully opened shadow crossing that had been established at a weak point in the veil between the planes .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In Neverdeath, the crossing was located at the center of the graveyard in a section known as Craftsman's Rest .</p>
<p>In Evernight, users of the crossing appeared between a pair of iron gates that otherwise appeared to lead nowhere. This site was located atop a small hill in a mostly abandoned neighborhood to the south. It lay within sight of the Thayan headquarters .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>On the Evernight side of the crossing, hidden Thayan guards kept watch over the portal. These included undead who were loyal to Valindra rather than to the city's ghoul rulers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1479Â DR , Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces were making use of the shadow crossing to prosecute their evil plans in Neverwinter, to establish a foothold in Evernight, and to secure access to the Shadowfell Road . Wanting to keep her out of the Shadowfell, her Netherese enemies sought to disrupt her access to the crossing. To avoid alerting Neverwinter to their presence, the Netherese aimed to use indirect means to thwart her, such as by hiring adventurers .</p>
