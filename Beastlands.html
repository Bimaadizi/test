<p>The Beastlands were a region of plains at the eastern end of the Shaar . It was home to various non-human monstrous tribes who were allied in a loose confederation for self-defense. The eastern edge of this region was formed by the Giant's Belt Mountains , a range which separated the plains from the desert to the east.</p>
