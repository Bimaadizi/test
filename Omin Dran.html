<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Omin was regarded as a ruthless businessman, but rather inept concerning relationships and games of chance.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Omin and his two sisters Portentia and Auspicia grew up in Red Larch , raised by their mother, the elven paladin of Tymora Prophetess Dran . The siblings enjoyed forays into the neighboring mountains, until one day Auspicia went missing after an encounter with the Wandering Crypt .</p>
<p>As part of his efforts to reunite with his missing sister, Omin founded Acquisitions Incorporated, an adventuring company for hire whose franchises spread throughout the Sword Coast and even into other worlds such as Ravnica .</p>

<p>In 1491 DR , after the assassinations of the Masked Lords Oszbur Malankar , Dathanscza Meiril , and Ammasker Gwelt , Omin nevertheless felt safe enough that he did not seek to hire bodyguards like his fellow Masked Lord, Landarmyn Voskur .
