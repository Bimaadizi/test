<p>An amulet of power was a powerful magical amulet that periodically boosted the wearer's latent magical energy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once acquired, amulets of power took 30 days to meld with their new wearers and become fully functional. Once functional they would, one day a week, boost the effective amount of spells that the wearers could cast, alongside the power, duration, and range by 50%, rounding down. As the wearer's spell capabilities went up, so did their ability to overcome their target's resistances against their spells.</p>
