<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Gondian foundry of Baldur's Gate was taken over by Enver Gortash and his cultists of Bane. Gondian foundry workers were forced to work on forging the lord's steel watchers . Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with incineration collars controlled by Prinski's Motivators.</p>
<p>During the Absolute crisis , Lowa , one of the enslaved foundry workers, stood up to Black Gauntlet Tamia Holzt, stating that the watchers' gyronetics required workers with steady hands and sharp eyes, not exhausted slaves with trembling muscles. Lowa demanded rest from her captors but was reminded of her son, who was held hostage underwater at the sunken Iron Throne headquarters . Faced with the threat of her own death and the death of her son, Lowa promised to finish the steel watchers by the first light of dawn.</p>
<p>Tamia Holzt's fate following the crisis' resolution remained unconfirmed but it was presumed she was killed by a group of adventurers who stood against the Absolute and tried to rescue the hostages.</p>
