<p>The Army Scythes , or simply light crossbows of speed , were a variety of enchanted light crossbows that fired and reloaded at lightning speeds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Light crossbows of speed consisted of a wooden bow attached to a sharf, called a tiller. Most commonly, they were made of ash or yewwood . When a bolt was loaded in, the weapon's crossbar began to gently radiate a blue glow.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These weapons possessed a simple enchantment that increased the punch from the bolts fired out and guided them toward the targets. Additionally, they possessed lightning speed that made the weapon much quicker to be shot and reloaded, effectively doubling the number of shots one could unleash, compared to regular crossbows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A large stash of The Army Scythes was discovered by the inhabitants of a short-lived human outpost in the Frozen Forest sometime before the late 13 th century DR . The weapons were found in an old ruin of unknown origin. The human settlers went on using the enchanted weapons to claim large territory for themselves, only to eventually be exterminated by a large army of hobgoblins .</p>
<p>In the following centuries, The Army Scythe weapon ended up in a few places, including the ruins of the Severed Hand in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the town of Lonelywood in Icewind Dale in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , one such crossbow was in stock of the Thunderhammer Smithy in the town of Beregost , and Bernard , the innkeep at the Copper Coronet in Athkatla , sold one of The Army Scythes to the inn's unsavory guests.</p>
