<p>The Guards District of Athkatla was a district on the east end of the city, that served as the home for many of the city of coin's guards and mercenaries, as well as a haven for its adventurers.</p>
<p>Most Athkatlans did not have a favorable view of adventurers, and didn't consider it a genuine trade. As such, those who lived the adventuring lifestyle were not welcome in most parts of the city, unless they were to spend an extravagant amount of coin. In this regard, the guards district became the home of the Athkatlan adventurer.</p>
<p>The guards district was located on the southern bank of the Alandor River , just east of the bridge . Leading out the city further was the Heroes' Gate .</p>
