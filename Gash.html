<p>Gash was a gnoll in the Labyrinth in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gash was with his fellow gnolls in the Labyrinth when a pack of minotaurs ambushed and killed most of his peers. Gash survived by betraying his kind to the minotaurs. He was so successful that the minotaurs decided to spare Gash, until he continued to send more and more gnolls and other beings into minotaur ambushes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The abuses of the minotaurs had broken his will and Gash had become a pathetically loyal and willing slave of his masters.</p>
