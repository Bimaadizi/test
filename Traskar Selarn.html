<p>Traskar Selarn , the Lord of Secomber , is a tall, regal and good-natured man. He has agreed to keep watch over the city for the Lords' Alliance by intervening in its affairs when necessary, but otherwise leaving it's inhabitants to themselves.
He often sends adventurers to ruins he knows holds promise in that they have not yet been looted.</p>
