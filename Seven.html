<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Sundered Sails, 307 DR , they abandoned Halaster's Hold and moved into Undermountain.</p>
<p>As of 1372 DR , it was believed one of the Seven was dead, two others remained alive, and the fate of the others was still unknown. The two known to still be alive were Trobriand the Metal Mage and Muiral the Misshapen.</p>
<h2>Other Known Apprentices</h2>
<p>Shradin Mulophor : Shradin was a powerful Netherese necromancer who'd survived the collapse of his civilization . While he was not an original apprentice, in the Year of the Angry Sea, 1148 DR , he learned of Sargauth Enclave and petitioned to become an apprentice to the Mad Mage. Halaster agreed and also allowed him to take the Enclave as his own. Shradin, calling himself the "Lord of Bones", turned the Enclave into Skullport , a neutral way-station permanently linking Undermountain to the Underdark.</p>
