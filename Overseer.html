<p>Overseers were among the most dangerous of the beholderkin . Rivaling the power of a hive mother , an overseer resembled nothing more than a large mass of flesh or a tree with mouths on its trunk and eyes on its branches.</p>
<p>Overseers possessed powers similar to that of a hive mother and could control the actions of five to ten standard beholders or five to twenty beholderkin. However, overseers could only control creatures of the same type. Thus, one overseer could control deathkisses or directors but not a combination of the two beholder types.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A few overseers existed in the beholder city of Zokir , though they were rarer there than in other beholder colonies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Calishite records suggest that overseers may have fought in the Eye Tyrant Wars and earlier wars in Calimshan , along with other beholder abominations.</p>
