<p>The Tankard of Eels was a tavern in Marsember , Cormyr , operating around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>It took its name from a half-ogre patron who once drank a tankard of eels as a bet. The beverage was later removed from the menu.</p>
<p>It was clean, warm, and pleasant, and sold a good variety of ales, wines, and liquors, including zzar . Violence was rare here and it was a good place to hear gossip and news from the Sea of Fallen Stars area, although there was no official entertainment on offer, nor adornments. It was all talk.</p>
