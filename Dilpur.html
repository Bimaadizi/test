<p>Dilpur was an important Impilturian city found on the shores of the Easting Reach in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dilpur was a rather insignificant location until its population swelled with refugees. After the influx of citizens, plans were quickly made to construct new city walls and expand the docks.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Dilpur's population in 1357 DR was 15,000, many of whom were refugees from neighboring Sarshel when that city fell into decline after a drop-off in trade from Damara .</p>
<p>Dilpur's lords— Imbraun , Soargilm , and Sambrar —were concerned for the future of their city. They believed a renewal in trade, specifically for bloodstone , would benefit the city and Impiltur as a whole, but the renewed trade with Damara might also tempt many of Dilpur's citizens to return to Sarshel.</p>
