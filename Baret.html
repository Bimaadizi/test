<p>Baret was a young man of Yhaunn who joined the temple of Shar in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Baret was a rowdy and shiftless young man of the upper classes, eager for fighting and carousing to relieve his boredom. He was a loyal servant of Shar 's cult, and sought to glorify her, though he had more enthusiasm than wisdom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleasis of 1373 DR , Baret was introduced to the newly-recruited Keph Thingoleir by Variance Amatick (disguised as Jarull Cartcoster ). Baret joined Starne and Talisk in forming Keph's new social circle, joining him in carousing about the city and making him feel welcome in the church of Shar . On one such adventure they came across Keph's rival Lyraene , and blocked her friends from intervening while Keph fought an unfair duel with her.</p>
<p>On the night of the new moon, Baret joined Variance's attack on Moonshadow Hall , thinking he would help tear down the temple rather than serving as an expendable distraction. In the defeat that followed, he was likely captured by the city guard and given the opportunity to reject Shar's service.</p>
