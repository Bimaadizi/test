<p>Kree Derryck was a duergar warlock who died in the 15 th century DR , killed by the Cult of the Absolute .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kree was a stout duergar woman with grey eyes and skin. She kept her scalp and face clean-shaven. Kree had a tattoo in her lips.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Kree Derryck joined the Cult of the Absolute, she found a use for her ability to kill with a mere whisper. Despite Kree being a valuable asset to the Absolute , her total devotion to her warlock patron meant Kree could never dedicate herself to the new deity fully. This signed her death warrant, and Kree was killed by the cult in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Her soul yearned for revenge, and Kree Derryck ended up among the dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane , chosen by the entity called Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three and their Cult of the Absolute.</p>
