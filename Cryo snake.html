<p>A cryo snake was a large snake that attacked with icy breath. They were the cold equivalent of pyro snakes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like other snakes, cryo snakes had animal-like intelligence. These green-blue snakes were ferocious.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These large snakes were completely immune to cold-based attacks. They attacked with icy breath similar to that of a white dragon .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Cryo snakes were rarely encountered by other races, as they only inhabited very high elevations where the temperature was dangerously cold. They only really moved down during extraordinarily cold winters.</p>
<p>They were known to lurk in the palace of Gothmenes .</p>
