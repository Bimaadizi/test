<p>Aekyl Dafyre was a shopkeeper in Skullport during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aekyl was always in a bad mood, grunting and grumbling to people that talked to him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1340 DR , Aekyl was a cartographer and guide for Undermountain until a day when he was guiding three nobles and, thanks to one of Halaster 's gates , they were ambushed by two owlbears . Aekyl lost his left arm and two nobles died before they could escape. Back in the Yawning Portal tavern in Waterdeep , the remaining noble accused Aekyl of murder, so he fled to Skullport.</p>
<p>Here, with only one arm, he thought his life was finished and started drinking. One day, however, there appeared in front of him the Skulls of Skullport , which ordered him to bring them a "dragon's tooth" from a location east of the city. Some time after, Aekyl returned with a magical short sword of dancing named Dragon's Tooth , many emeralds , and a pair of magical boots of guiding . He discovered that, by just entering a dungeon and walking slowly, the boots mapped the place.</p>
<p>With this new knowledge Aekyl returned to his old job and opened a map shop in the Port of Shadows , known as Sword and Sextant .</p>
