<p>Dlueae Sharshyndree was one of the eight members of the First Zulkirate , the first female zulkir, and the Zulkir of Evocation in 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dlueae was a buxom Thayan human woman with a melodious voice and delicate seductive strut. In contrast, her face was rough, badly scarred, and masculine. She shaved facial hair and most times wore full-head masks as well as a bottle- helm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In her youth, the future zulkir led an adventurer's life that resulted in a collection of disfiguring facial scars. But that vocation also granted her skills of a confident and level-headed battle-leader and tactician. Later in life, she led Thay 's armies into wars. Through military life, she gained influence among other Red Wizards . Dlueae Sharshyndree became the first member of the Council of Zulkirs from the school of evocation magic in the autumn of the Year of Warlords, 1030 DR . The council was assembled under the diviner lich Ythazz Buvaar . The title allowed Dlueae to select the tharchions and gave her absolute control over a sliver of Thay . She became an influential member of the First Zulkirate, taking fellow zulkirs as consorts and helping them with delicate personal matters. She had a solid track record of creating successful policies for the nation supported by the zulkirate. She also served as the Council's mediator and peacemaker.</p>
<p>Dlueae's reign as the Zullkir of Evocation came to an end sometime before the late Year of the Starfall, 1300 DR .</p>
