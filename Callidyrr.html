<p>Callidyrr was a Ffolk kingdom on the isle of Alaron within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Callidyrr encompassed all but the far northern section of Alaron, including the Fairheight Range and all lands south of the mountains. The kingdom was broken into four distinct counties. Aside from the Fairheight Range, the Dernall Forest was the dominant feature in northern Callidyrr, while the plains of Bregonshire covered much of southern Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The kingdom had an army that mustered alongside its knights of the realm . During the 15 th century DR , an elite force known as the Callidyrr dragoons rose to prominence: these particularly loyal knights and heroes had the power to speak with the authority of the High Kings and Queens, and often embarked on clandestine missions for the crown.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Callidyrr's primary export was armor and other fine steel products, which it mainly traded north to Waterdeep and south to Calimport , where timber and furs were also in demand. Callidyrr was the most welcoming of the various Moonshae kingdoms to outsiders, and foreign merchants brought in spices , oil , and cloth from the north and silk , spice, horses , and parchment from the south.</p>
<p>Callidyrr also traded metal goods with the other Ffolk kingdoms of Corwell and Moray , and received ale , livestock , coal , iron , and labor in return. They additionally sold timber to nearby Mintarn , where it was used for shipbuilding.</p>
<p>The southern reaches of Alaron controlled by Callidyrr was a major agricultural breadbasket, and fishing was a major industry in the Strait of Alaron to the west and in Whitefish Bay to the east. The only mining in the realm was in the south of the Fairheight Range on the northern edge of the kingdom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Callidyrr, and Caer Callidyrr in particular, served as the seat of power for the High King of the Ffolk. The Cymrych , Carrathal , and Kendrick monarchs all ruled from Caer Callidyrr.</p>
<p>By the midâ€“14 th century DR, the kingdom's vast array of natural resources had attracted more visitors from the Sword Coast compared with any other region of the Moonshae Isles. This had led to a population that was more cosmopolitan than elsewhere on the isles.</p>
<p>Following the founding of the United Moonshae Isles in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the High Kings and Queens of Callidyrr became High Kings and Queens of the whole of the Moonshaes. Following the death of High Queen Alicia Kendrick in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR , separatists and insurgents severely weakened the kingdom, and Callidyrr struggled to recover for over seven decades.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the kingdom was harried by mercenaries from Amn , lycanthropes , and unseelie fey from Dernall Forest , forcing many to flee their homes and seek refuge in Caer Callidyrr. The appearance of the fey in Dernall was seen by the kingdom as a violation of the armistice agreed upon between Callidyrr and the fey of Sarifal in prior decades.</p>
