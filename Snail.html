<p>A snail was a variety of simple mollusks that could be found on land, in the sea, and in bodies of freshwater. Those that inhabited bodies of saltwater were typically distinguished as sea snails .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like many mollusks, snails carried around a hard protective shell on their boneless bodies that often had a whorled pattern. These shells had an opening which was fitted around the rear of a snail. Whenever they felt threatened, a snail would retract its body into its shell.</p>
<p>Snails typically left trails of slime wherever they moved, which was at a notably slow speed. The underside of a snail had an adhesive quality to it, which allowed them to climb up near-vertical surfaces.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Snails were generally docile creatures.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Snails were used as a food item in many parts of the Realms. For long-term storage, they were sometimes pickled . The manner in which snails were most commonly eaten in the Realms was hot and buttered . Such a delicacy was in some places reserved for the nobility, like in Waterdeep , or as part of an eveningfeast meal at higher-class inns, taverns, and other eateries. Some variations on buttered snails included having them roasted on skewers and then dipped into butter, having the snails fried prior to being buttered, and some served them in spiced wine .</p>
<p>Some of the many establishments in the Realms known to serve hot & buttered snails included the Maid of the Moors in Mornbryn's Shield , the Fair Maid in Ripplestones , and The Raven's Glory in Ravens Bluff .</p>
<p>In Menzoberranzan , it was not uncommon to find drow dining upon spiced, steamed snails. And besides humans and demihumans , a number of lizardfolk were also notably fond of snails.</p>
<p>Their use as a food item was of such commonality in Daunting , a city in the Deep Kingdom , that its dwarven residents had snail farmers.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Most land-dwelling snails were hermaphroditic , manufacturing both eggs and sperm cells.</p>
<p>Most land dwelling species also entered a state of dormancy, similar to hibernation, during winter months due to the scarcity of vegetation.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Snaills commonly fed upon vegetation. Some subterranean snail species fed upon fungi . Those that fed upon the fungi that grew in areas moderately-strong to very strong levels of faerzress had trace amounts of that magical radiation imparted into their flesh.</p>
<p>Some species of snail were, alarmingly, flesh eaters.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were known to be found in Cormyr , parts of Northwest Faerûn , such as the High Forest , in the marshy waters of the High Moor , in the Serpent Hills , and in the land of Turmish . They could also be found beneath the surface in the Underdark , such as in the Great Bhaerynden region, as well as in Undermountain .</p>
<p>In Kara-Tur , they were known to inhabit the Shao Mountains , where the locals referred to them in their language as 'siput'.</p>
<p>In Zakhara 's Crowded Sea, land snails could be found on the Steaming Isles and the island of Jazayir al-Alfar . On the latter, a tribe of halflings called the Tarangu supplemented their diets with the snails.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Snails were preyed upon by a number of wild creatures, including frogs and toads , saltors , and sea gulls .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR , at The Salty Dog in Ravens Bluff, the wizard Mastraero of Calaunt lost in a game of chess to an unwashed sailor and was so embarrassed by this defeat that he turned all of the eye witnesses into snails. His opponent then revealed himself to be Ambassador Carrague , who proceeded to use his own magic to reverse the polymorphing .</p>
<p>Around that same century, the wizard Elminster visited Ed of the Greenwood on Earth with a Turmishan skullcap treat and sat down for a chat about that Vilhonna republic. The two sat together by Ed's fireplace, roasting the snails on bamboo skewers and dipping them in garlic butter . Ed would later find himself feeling sick from the evening of dining on snails, though Elminster was none the worst for ware.</p>
<p>On Eleasis 4 , 1364 DR , Elminster had the mage Calabrista and several of her students over for tea , the mage wanting him to by test her students' aptitude for the Art . At this soiree he pranked her by pretending to be eating sandwiches made of snails and tree slugs , garnished with pepper and lemon -squeezings. He claiming they were all the rage among the Waterdhavian nobility and that it was considered good fortune to come across one with a still live snail or slug in it. Using illusion magic, he even made it appear that a slug was trying to undulate out of one of the sandwiches. After he had his fun messing with them, Elminster eventually revealed that the sandwiches actually consisted of merely mustard, cheese , and cucumbers .</p>
