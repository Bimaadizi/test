<p>Chereth , eventually the Old Man of the Mountain , was a druid , follower of Silvanus , and Master of the Yuirwood . He resurrected the assassin Kheil and retrained him as Berun . On 1374 DR , he attempted to destroy all of civilization in Faerûn with a supervolcano.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On 1374 DR , Chereth's hair had become a bone-white mane entwined with leaves, some of them appearing to grow there, although it had lost none of its thickness. He was slightly stooped.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Chereth could alter his features at will, an ability he employed to impersonate Alaodin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 1365 DR , Chereth requested an audience with Alaodin to study the Imaskari lore in the fortress of Sentinelspire , hoping to find an edge to push against civilization's encroachment into the wild. While there, he discovered the Erael'len , a relic of Silvanus . He decided to flee the fortress, taking the relic, and slew several assassins on the way out. That earned him the enmity of the Old Man of the Mountain, who sent a dozen of his best men, including Kheil and Sauk , to slay him and the other Masters of the Yuirwood. The assassins arrived on Mirtul 2 . Though some went uncaptured, the assassin Kheil was captured, and tortured to death by the rangers.</p>
<p>Chereth returned the assassin Kheil to life, as Berun, and trained him as a druid of Silvanus . The two of them traveled together to many places, including the Khopet Dag , where they remained with the yaqubi for two seasons. They parted ways in 1369 DR after they rescued a boy named Lewan from raiders of the Ganathwood , where Chereth had found something he needed in order to combat civilization's encroachment. Chereth had Berun swear he would not come for him unless specifically bid so and even then only by the druid himself.</p>
<p>After 1369 DR , Chereth replaced Alaodin as the Old Man of the Mountain in Sentinelspire . Per Sauk , the Old Man of the Mountain had grown rather more insane after that point, having slain three western noble clients for no reason. He had also summoned Killoren to serve him at the Citadel. Per Berun , the Old Man may have contrived for Sauk to bring him and Erael'len , which he sought, to the fortress. He was aware they still managed to capture Lewan, however, and had a conversation with the guest, in disguise.</p>
<p>Chereth did not reveal himself to Lewan and Berun until the night of Tarsakh 25 that year, when the latter forced his way through the guardians of the fortress. He proposed them that they should come with him to an Outer Plane once he successfully induced a supervolcanic eruption in Sentinelspire , plunging all of Faerûn into a volcanic winter to cause widespread famine and mass dying, so as to temporarily reduce civilization's impact upon nature, and leave them open to his guidance on the years after. He only needed Erael'len to accomplish this. His disciple refused and fought him, stalling until the window of opportunity for the rite was over. Berun's own pupil, Lewan, dealt him the killing blow at the end of a long, protracted fight.</p>
