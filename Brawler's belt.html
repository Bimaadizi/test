<p>Brawler's belts were enchanted belts created by the members of the Order of the Dark Moon to improve their deadly hand-to-hand combat abilities.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There were two types of these belts: regular brawler's belts and much more powerful greater brawler's belts . Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from bludgeoning damage; however, the greater versions of these belts were significantly more potent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brawler's belts were created by the Dark Moon sect to give its members an unfair advantage over other monastic orders in the annual hand-to-hand combat challenges. By the late 14 th century DR , there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the Sword Coast , being found in Neverwinter 's shops and around adventurers' waists, as well as in the temples of Hillsfar .</p>
