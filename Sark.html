<p>Sark was a crudely named stew served at the Copper Coronet tavern of Athkatla in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The word " sark " was a crude expletive and an apt name for the dish. Sark was a stew cooked with Athkatlan harbor water and various unsavory leavings of the River District , like fish guts, catfish carcasses, cheap mussels , dog cadavers, rats , and dew-worms . The concoction was flavored with various herbs picked in the Grave District and served in hollowed-out stale moldy bread bowls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarks were a popular but foul creation of Old Skratha , the cook of the Copper Coronet in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR. These dishes were the only food available at the tavern and the only food its clientele could afford. Skratha was known to slip poison into a serving of the stew if compensated accordingly.</p>
