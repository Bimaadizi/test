<p>Kheldivur was a veteran battle-mage. At some point prior to the Year of the Tired Treant, 1318 DR , he was killed somewhere in Chessenta during a war between wizards in sight of a young Maldiglas Turntower . Glittering rings remained on his hand. The young man snatched what he could from Kheldivur's charred corpse before it cooled down, kickstarting his own career as a wizard.</p>
