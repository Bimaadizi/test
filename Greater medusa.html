<p>Greater medusae were a breed of medusae with a massive serpentine tail instead of humanoid legs and torso.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greater medusae were quite rare, being born at only one in ten births. Like their more common kin, they had heads of living snakes and bodies covered in fine scales, but instead of a woman's lower body, they had snake tails. A greater medusa stood between 6 feet (1.8 meters) and 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall with a tail that could reach from 10 feet (3 meters) to 20 feet (6.1 meters).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Greater medusae were solitary creatures, rarely venturing far from their lairs. Most of them had a malicious nature, however, there were some odd exceptions—individuals who lacked an evil streak and preferred the studious lives of a mage -researcher and a vintner.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like a regular medusa, greater medusae could turn living creatures to stone with a mere glance at the range of 30 feet (9.1 meters) with their petrifying gaze reaching into the Ethereal Plane as well as the Astral Plane , and their serpentine hair could launch venomous bites at opponents within 1 foot (0.3 meters). One important distinction from their mundane kin was poisonous blood. Greater medusae's poisonous blood was so potent that even touching a dead creature was a deadly endeavor. Some of these creatures used that poison to coat their weapons or arrows . Additionally, greater medusae had limited resistance to magic.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>A rare type of crossbreed was known to be possible, spawned from a greater medusa and a yuan-ti abomination .</p>
