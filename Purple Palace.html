<p>The Purple Palace was a festhall in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood on Zastrow Street (formerly Slut Street) in the Dock Ward , on the southern end near Fillet Lane , between the Old Xoblob Shop and the Aurora's Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter (with a narrow side alley separating them).</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was four stories high.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Described by Volo as "the closest thing Waterdeep has to a Calishite silks-boudoir", the Purple Palace was a luxurious place of soft carpets, countless cushions, lavender-hued silk draperies and gauzy hangings, which were strongly perfumed.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Companionship here was pricy, but said to be very good. They also sold a spiced wine that was tinted purple.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Purple Palace was established before 1357 DR and was in operation through the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck on Tarsakh 5 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , during celebrations for Goldenight as part of Waukeentide , when the companions were covered in no more than gold dust. That night, four aurumvorax left Undermountain through the Old Xoblob Shop , then burst into the Purple Palace. They slew four of the festhall girls and three patrons before they were subdued. It was unclear if the beasts came at Halaster 's bidding or by chance, but the shop owner Dandalus Ruell couldn't explain how they escaped its magical safeguards, leading the City Watch to suspect sabotage. The victims' families and the festhall were given the aurumvorax hides, but it was meager compensation.</p>
<p>It was still in business by 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The proprietress of the Purple Palace was Tathla "Flamehair" Nightstar , a famed courtesan of Calimshan .</p>
