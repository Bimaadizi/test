<p>Fador was a worker of the Lake of Steam region in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He worked at the canal site that was being constructed by the city-state of Innarlith to connect the Sea of Fallen Stars to the Lake of Steam in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR .</p>
<p>He and some other workers noticed that Ivar Devorast had clandestinely returned to the canal site. Devorast had previously headed the project before he was dismissed by the city's ruler, Ransar Salatis . Fador approached Devorast and promised to keep his secret, but asked for his advice concerning orders by Senator Horemkensi to use a smaller amount of sand than Devorast had originally instructed. Devorast insisted that they return to his original design and Fador agreed to convey this to the others. In order to avoid Horemkensi from becoming suspicious that the work wasn't speeding up, Fador also followed a suggestion from Devorast's friend Surero to lie to Horemkensi about slowing down the work to reshod the horses.</p>
