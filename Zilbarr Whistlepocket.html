<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Kythorn 24 of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , Zilbarr Whistlepocket found himself in the Blushing Mermaid tavern in the Lower City , where he came across a fellow investigator named Tav , who'd spent the previous several days untangling the grisly murder on Sailor's Crossing . Zilbarr recognized Tav as a fellow investigator and shared his own findings on the case: apparently a series of murders, the third in a row in three tendays . Zilbarr shared that the other murders took place in Insight Park and the Silver Crescent Beach . Tav promised to inform Zilbarr of any future findings and set off to investigate the murder sites.</p>
<p>On Kythorn 29 , Tav read the latest article from under Zilbarr Whistlepocket's quill : a report on yet another murder, this time at the Blade and Stars . Soon after, Tav visited Zilbarr at his desk on the second floor of Baldur's Mouth offices. The investigators exchanged notes, and Zilbarr sent Tav to interview the mortician who dealt with the bodies at the Harborside Hospital . Another lead of Zilbarr's was the druid of Insight Park. However, Tav's and Zilbarr's investigation was never completed as several days later, Tav was murdered by the mysterious white-scaled dragonborn known as the Dark Urge of Bhaal .</p>
