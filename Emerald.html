<p>Emerald was a brilliant green variety of beryl found in the Realms. These gems were notoriously fragile and needed to be protected from impacts and drastic temperature changes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Emerald cleaved easily along orthogonal lines, making rectangular cuts (the "emerald" cut, known as a modified step cut in lapidary parlance) the most common form for this jewel. This included table facet (square) and baguette (long rectangular) cuts. Emerald came in many shades, but only the most transparent brilliant green shade merited the highest prices. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp. Emeralds with weak or tainted coloring were classified as gem stones with base value of 1,000 gp. Emeralds in the post- Second Sundering years declined in value to where even the most desired shades were given a base value of 1,000 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Emeralds were associated with health, and so were used in creating and decorating magical devices which improved health and healing, fertility, and growth. Whole cut emeralds served well as the tip of a wand or other devices that had health and growth effects. Crushed and powdered, emerald dust was used in the inks for scrolls and added to magical immersions for items intended for these same purposes. The best time of day to apply emeralds in magical workings was at waterclock .</p>
<p>Emeralds could be used to detect hidden treachery, hatred, and deceit without the use of magic. The stones would crack or break in the immediate presence of perfidy. Kings were known to wear rings carved out of emerald when attending important meetings, parleys, and critical negotiations.</p>
<p>Ancient gem magic associated emeralds with gates and other gating powers, which was the source of emerald golems ' ability to create shimmering green teleportation circles .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
