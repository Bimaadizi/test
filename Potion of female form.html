<p>Potions of female form were magic potions that changed the imbiber's body to that of a female of their species.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When consumed, a potion of female form transformed the drinker's body into that of a woman. It was believed that the potion's effects lasted only for twenty-four hours. However, that was not always the case. There was a ten percent chance that the transformation was permanent and could only be reversed through the wish spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the Church of Selûne in Ravens Bluff sought to retrieve and destroy the obsidian amulet of the Dark Maiden – the prison of Jessar , the dark goddess enemy of Selûne . The amulet could only be handled by a woman equipped with a special silver gauntlet in order to avoid being possessed by the deity. All men who touched the amulet were immediately destroyed, and their souls consumed. The Temple of Selûne assembled groups of adventurers of the Living City to send them in search of the artifact. Those groups lacking females were offered these potions, promising temporary effects lasting only a day.</p>
