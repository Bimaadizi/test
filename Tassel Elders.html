<p>The Tassel Elders were a group of representatives that assisted with the rule of Tasseldale . One member was elected from each tassel, typically a wise citizen or pillar of the community, and advised the Grand Mairshar on decisions of major importance. Their counsel was required before the Lord could create new laws, rally the dale's militia, or deploy the Mairshars outside of Tasseldale.</p>
<p>The Elders' approval was required when an outgoing Grand Mairshar selected their successor before retirement.</p>
