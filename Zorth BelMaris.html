<p>Zorth Bel Maris was the 19 th Baron of Polten in Damara .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zorth was a coward but adept at politics.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zorth claimed to be a member of the ruling family of Polten, House Bel Maris , but he was a pretender to this noble lineage. He was well-trusted as an advisor by his successor, Baron Donlevy the Young .</p>
<p>He was a strong supporter of Baron Dimian Ree of Morov and Baroness Sylvia of Ostel , and was staunchly opposed to the rise of King Gareth Dragonsbane , which prompted Gareth's allies, the Twilight Riders , to begin spying on Zorth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Witch-King Zhengyi of Vaasa slew King Virdin Bloodfeathers of Damara in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , he launched a massive spree of assassinations to eliminate all Damaran barons and dukes who might resist him. This included the venerable and well-loved Baron Donlevy the Old of Polten , along with every known member of his noble family, House Bel Maris. Zorth then claimed the barony, pretending to be a cousin of the deceased baron.</p>
<p>Zorth ruled for 2 years, and his reign was characterized by bickering with the other baronies. He also levied heavy taxes being on the people to pay tribute to Zhengyi. It was widely understood that Zhengyi had chosen Zorth to assume control of the barony, but it remained a matter of debate whether this might have been because Zorth was his servant or just because Zorth was too incompetent to pose a threat.</p>
<p>During the Bloodstone Wars of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Zorth allied with Dimian Ree of Morov and Sylvia of Ostel to subdue the upstart new baron of Bloodstone , Gareth Dragonsbane. This gambit failed in spectacular fashion, and Polten was humiliated by Gareth's allies, the halflings of the Warren . Even worse for Zorth, when his soldiers returned and told tales of their experiences, they spoke highly of the courage and mercy of Gareth and his allies, greatly endearing him to the commonfolk. This was exacerbated when Zhengyi entered the war and Zorth refused to aid Bloodstone in fighting against him. Nearly one thousand soldiers defected from Polten to join the battle anyway, and subsequently they took their families and left the barony altogether. An entire town in the eastern reaches of the barony, Tellerth , threatened to secede as well.</p>
<p>With his popular support at an all-time minimum, this was the moment that the last true heir of House Bel Maris, Donlevy the Young, came forward to claim his birthright. Knowing that his time as baron was over, Zorth stepped down, but shrewdly convinced the new baron to keep him and his court around to act as advisors. Zorth soon wielded outsized influence over Donlevy, directing him to act in the interests of Dimian Ree against Gareth Dragonsbane’s rise to king.</p>
