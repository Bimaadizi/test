Kei spent some time adventuring, evident by many stories she accumulated over the years. The half-elf often exchanged one of her wild tales for a hearty meal at a tavern.</p>
<p>In the Year of Storms, 1310 DR , Kei the Wooden Idol found herself in the northern city of Luskan , where she joined the Annals of Halgren. The adventuring troupe searched for mercenaries, and the rogue happily joined.</p>
