<p>Xantriph , known as The Voice of Bane , was a beholder member of the Zhentarim and one of the closest allies of Manshoon in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xantriph was a beholder living in the Temple in the Sky , a strange flying hollow rock over Teshendale . Informed by his spies of the strange place, Manshoon investigated personally, hoping to find powerful magic. Instead, he discovered the beholder Xantriph. The two canny individuals joined forces, claiming the rock was a conduit to the gods. Banite priests flocked to the place where Xantriph, calling itself the Voice of Bane, instructed them all to do as Manshoon commanded, joining the Zhentarim and leading them away from the decadent High Imperceptor of the church. However, in order to do this, Manshoon and his magelings had to pledge fealty to Bane , promising to lead the faith to even greater heights of power than the weakening High Imperceptor had. Furthermore, Manshoon promised control of the priesthood and Zhentil Keep to the beholders, or so it seemed. Xantriph's pact promised support to the Zhentarim in exchange for an army of warriors, wizards, and priests in an assault on Ooltul .</p>
<p>Xantriph sent certain small sneaking creatures to spy on Zhentish citizens and Banite priests, and passed information to Manshoon, who would use it to eliminate any threats to him. Xantriph aided Manshoon in seizing control of Zhentil Keep's ruling councils.</p>
<p>The plot was ruined when, in the Year of the Morningstar, 1350 DR , the adventurers known as the Knights of Myth Drannor discovered the Temple and in exploring it they found Xantriph. The Knights soon fought the evil monster and killed Xantriph.</p>
<p>In the years after, Xantriph and Zorkha were largely supplanted by Manxam as the most powerful beholder in human affairs in the region and allies of Manshoon and Fzoul Chembryl , though Manxam kept a lower profile than Xantriph did. Moreover, Xantriph was replaced by the beholder Xulla as the Voice of Bane, lord of the Temple in the Sky, and Fzoul's advisor. Xulla and Manxam both upheld Xantriph's pact with the Zhentarim.</p>
