<p>Arundoom was a mage who inhabited the city of Waterdeep at an undertermined time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arundoom was treacherously attacked by his apprentice who hurled three daggers into his back. Arundoom survived however, and enacted his revenge in a truly creative way. He placed a magical curse upon the alley where he was attacked, causing a trio of daggers to fly through the air and attack his apprentice. Arundoom used magical fear to force his apprentice to walk through the alley three times, once for every eight years of apprenticeship. The alley was later named Three Daggers Alley because of this incident and the curse survived through the late 14 th century DR despite many attempts to dispel it.</p>
