<p>A ring of djinni summoning , also sometimes called ring of djinni calling , or simply djinn ring , was a variant of a ring of genie summoning from Zakhara , more common in Faerûn , that could summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When activated via rubbing, or my uttering its command word , a ring of djinni summoning opened up a magical gate , calling forth a specific djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air and only from the Elemental Plane of Air, unlike a ring of genie summoning . It typically took the named djinni to appear at least six seconds. The summoned djinni was compelled to fully obey its master for no more than one hour per day. The ring would lose its magic if the djinni associated with it died. However, if such a ring was used in the Domains of Dread , the summoned djinni appeared only once and served its master for one hour and failed to return back to the Elemental Plane of Air. This violation of the pact immediately freed the djinni, free to do how it pleases to the owner of the ring and free to search for its own way of of the Domains of Dread.</p>
<p>Similar items were known to exist, like rings of efreeti calling , that were identical to the rings of djinni summoning , but summoned forth a different variety of a genie.</p>
<p>When observed through magic-detecting, rings of djinni summoning radiated powerful aura of conjuration .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Creating a ring of djinni summoning required a heart of a great wyrm brass dragon , valued at 25,000 gold pieces . The crafter should also be proficient at ring-making and creation of enchanted items, and being able to cast the gate spell .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the mid-14 th century DR , it was illegal to own rings of djinni summoning in Calimport and was considered to be a capital crime.</p>
