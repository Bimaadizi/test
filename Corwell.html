<p>Corwell was a Ffolk kingdom on the isle of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Corwell was located in southern Gwynneth. Its northern borders were marked by the Highlands and Cambro Mountains , both of which formed a rocky boundary between the northern half of the island. Much of Corwell was covered by the Llyrath Forest . The eastern arm of Corwell included the land between the Cambro Mountains and the Strait of Alaron from Kingsbay up to the settlement of Thorndyke , while in the west it reached all the way to Kimball Moor where Corwell Firth met the Trackless Sea . The long Corwell Road spanned much of the realms from east to west.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The kingdom was ruled from the town of Caer Corwell by House Kendrick until its fall at the end of 14 th century DR . The king was advised by a council comprised of the lords of nearby cantrevs, notably the Lords Dynnatt , Koart , and Nowll .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Corwell traded predominantly with nearby Callidyrr (exporting ales , horses , sheep , and able-bodied laborers in exchange for fine steel armor and weapons ) and with Calimport far to the south (exporting furs , metals , and timber in exchange for fine fabrics like silk , horses, parchment , and spices ). The primary ports were at Caer Corwell on the west coast and Kingsbay on the east.</p>
<p>Corwell boasted major agricultural centers along the southern coast of Corwell Firth in the west and along the eastern coast. Mining was a major production in the Highlands and especially in the Cambro Mountains. Major fishing grounds were present at the mouth of Corwell Firth and in the Kingsbay and Strait of Alaron.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Corwell was the first and oldest kingdom of the Ffolk within the Moonshaes Isles. It was founded in the Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR , by the first Ffolk king, Deric , shortly after the initial settlement of the island by Talfiric refugees from Faer√ªn at the site which would come to be known as Caer Corwell. After fighting to unite the various cantrevs of these early Ffolk, Deric managed a meager peace with nearby Synnoria but ultimately died without an heir in the Year of Unkind Weapons, 171 DR , parking a Ffolk civil war. This ended when Callidyrr Hugh united the kingdom once again as its new king in the Year of the Troublesome Vixen, 177 DR , and founded the Hugh Dynasty of Corwell . His son, Cymrych Hugh , would become a legendary Ffolk hero after slaying Kazgaroth , and later became the first High King of the Moonshaes. He moved his capital to Caer Callidyrr , and left Corwell in the hands of a regent, Christopher Riker . Some attributed the true founding of modern Corwell directly to Cymrych Hugh.</p>
<p>Christopher Riker would pass the regency of Corwell to his son, Cedric , after which rule would pass to a branch of the Cymrych family. While Cymrych rulers reigned in both Corwell and Callidyrr, the families soon diverged, with the former being the ancestors of the Kendrick family and the latter being the ancestors of the Carrathal family. In the Year of the Wrathful Revenant, 295 DR , the famously cruel Prince Ketheryll Cymrych , heir to the throne of the High King, accused Corwell's King Durnhal of conspiring against his father, and put both him and his queen to death in the Castle of Skulls .</p>
<p>The kingdom would be thrown into chaos during the events of the Darkwalker War in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , when Kazgoroth returned and led an assault on the capital known as the Battle of Caer Corwell , which saw the death of King Byron Kendrick . However, Kazgoroth was defeated by the king's son, Tristan Kendrick , who acquired the Sword of Cymrych Hugh and would go on to become the first true High King of the Moonshaes in centuries, founding the Kendrick Dynasty . The kingdom weathered yet another invasion the following year when forces of the god Bhaal launched the Second Battle of Caer Corwell , which was again thwarted by King Tristan.</p>
<p>After peace was forged between the Ffolk and the Northlanders by Tristan and his daughter, High Queen Alicia Kendrick , the greatest threat to Corwell in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR were Nelanther pirates who made occasional landings along the coast.</p>
<p>With the return of Karador and the rise of the fey realm of Sarifal in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , House Kendrick was unable to stem the tide of the encroaching fey into Corwell. After the United Moonshae Isles came into conflict with Amn over the island of Snowdown in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR , Amnian mercenaries subsequently put Corwell to the torch, creating the opportunity for High Lady Ordalf of Sarifal to declare that all humans were to be expelled from Gwynneth in the Year of the Dauntless Dwarves, 1412 DR . The fey subsequently laid siege to Caer Corwell and enslaved the humans who were not killed or who did not escape the island.</p>
<p>Over the following decades, the enslaved humans of Corwell were bred for docility by the ruling le Shay of Sarifal, and any technological or cultural advancement among the humans was ground to a halt. Eventually, a human resistance managed to gain a foothold, notably a group known as the Winterglen Claw as well as free humans operating the ports at Borth and Kingsbay . However, Corwell itself lay as little more than a string of ruins being rapidly reclaimed by the wild nature of Sarifal.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The realm had long been home to Ffolk humans and their halfling neighbors. By the late 15 th century DR, both these groups were largely absent, and the land once known as Corwell was home to fey and to wild moorhounds and owlbears . Notably, quicklings had come to make their homes in the former halfling burrows.</p>
