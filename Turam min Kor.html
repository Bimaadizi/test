<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though Imam Renn min Zann held the title of Keeper of the Mosques, Turam shared much of the workload. He selected who would be allowed to preach within the Golden Mosque on a daily basis. He tried to be fair in his selections and anyone who was turned down six days in a row would be allowed to preach on the seventh day should they return.</p>
