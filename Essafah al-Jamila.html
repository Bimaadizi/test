<p>Essahah's shop, called Items for the Immortals , catered to genies and other sha'irs.</p>
<p>Essafah specialized in the creation of genie prisons , usually in the form of a lamp or bottle, though he claimed he could fashion a genie prison out of any container. He kept three such prisons within his shop. They contained a slayer genie , an efreeti , and a noble dao and sold for 2,000 dinars .</p>

<p>A small fire gen served as Essafah's familiar . Since he was terrified that an angry genie would one day track him down and slay him, a pair of guardian genies served as his loyal bodyguards.</p>
