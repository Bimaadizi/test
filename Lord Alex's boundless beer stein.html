<p>Lord Alex's boundless beer stein was the enchanted never-ending ale stein that belonged to Lord Alex .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Lord Alex's boundless beer stein was just that. An ale mug that, once emptied, magically refilled itself with thick dark and frothy stout .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wizard Cathexis created this eternally refilling beer stein as a gift for his good friend, Lord Alex , a well-known loudmouthed bar-hopping adventurer. By 1372 DR , Lord Alex's boundless beer stein could be found in one of the piles of "antiques" within the Torleth's Treasures store of Gillian's Hill . The metal mug appeared mundane, and its magic remained unidentified, mixed with other junk, sold for a mere one hundred gold pieces.</p>
