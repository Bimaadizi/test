<p>Fineas Verran was a mage that lived in Neverwinter during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Fineas was proud of a collection of magical implements : a rod , a staff , and a wand .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Finneas was plagued with misfortune the day the Spellplague struck the Realms on Tarsakh 29 in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . First, Fineas left behind the rod while trading at the Merchant Guild Hall in the River District , misplaced the staff while taking a rest later on, and the wand likely slipped from Fineas's satchel somewhere along the way. The moment Finneas took time to lament about these woes in a journal, blue fire rained down from the skies causing great destruction in Neverwinter and beyond. Finneas would then lose the journal too.</p>
<p>Finneas's magical tools were rendered inert by the catastrophic event and were lost in the area. They were eventually found by an adventurer who came across Finneas's journal in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . The mage Riftel Farsight purchased them as curios.</p>
