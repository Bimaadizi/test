<p>Pipes of haunting were magical pan pipes that had the power to frighten creatures who heard them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whenever a proficient player played the pipes, they would emit an eerie, haunting tone that caused dread in everyone nearby, within 30 feet (9.1 meters). The musician could choose creatures otherwise affected to overcome the fear automatically, while everyone else was consumed by the fear for a minute, although they would attempt to break the hold on them throughout the pipes' effect.</p>
<p>Thrice a day the power could be called upon by the piper, and every dawn, it would regain some of its power.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The pipes themselves were not hard to make, as even a relative inexperienced mage could create these.</p>
<p>The bones from crypt things were especially suited to create pipes of haunting, and pipes made from their bones were able to produce an even worse feeling of dread in the listeners.</p>
