Despite its rundown appearance, the venue attracted a steady clientele of sailors, laborers, humanoids , and patrons who prioritized affordability over ambiance. While the decor and atmosphere was undeniably grim, the festhall was rarely empty. All patrons were welcome as long as they had coin to spend and treated the staff with respect.</p>

Betting on these matches was obligatory, with a minimum wager of 5 copper pieces .</p>
