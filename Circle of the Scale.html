<p>The Circle of the Scale was a druid circle active in the vicinity of the Dragonspine Mountains . This circle went extinct by the 15 th century DR , its only remaining members transformed into undead monsters.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Led by Skovac , a druid who styled himself as Scalebinder, the dragon -worshiping druids of the Circle of the Scale aimed to lure and enslave dragons. Relying on their magic and on kobold workers, they excavated a huge temple below Dragonspine Mountains to use as their base. They intended to use the magic of Tiamat's scale , a powerful magical relic, to control the mind of dragons.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Druids of the circle wore robes finely embroidered with each of the five colors of the chromatic dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Having heard of the circle's plans, the red dragon Scorlworyx attacked it alongside an army of orcs and kobolds and killed most of its members. Having survived the onslaught, Skovac sealed himself inside the Temple of the Scale with the relic of Tiamat . In time, he became a wight and continued to watch over his prized possession.</p>
