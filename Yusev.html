<p>Yusev the Acolyte was a young member of the Church of Kelemvor from the temple in Mulsantir , Rashemen , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yusev had strong features and wore heavy and oversized cowled Kelemvorite robes . His face was often creased by frowns of concentration.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Yusev, still a youth, was sent by his family to join Kelemvor's temple in Mulsantir. Despite still being a very fresh member of the faith, Yusev found the church to be disappointing. He was under the impression that the Church of Kelemvor permitted the study of necromancy like Kelemvor's divine predecessors did, something Yusev had a natural knack for, but after arrival, he realized the temple saw that school of magic to be an abomination. Yusev was tempted to learn more about the art of necromancy, but the temple's library was lacking. He enrolled aid of individuals outside of the Kelemvorite faith in order to procure tomes of necromantic lore. One such vault was hidden within the Death God's Temple , an old temple dedicated to Myrkul , located in Mulsantir's Shadowfell reflection.</p>
