<p>Denlor's Tower or Denelor's Tower was a former city defense structure in the city of Phlan . It was located in the harbor in the eastern part of the Old City . It was claimed by Denelor the Red , a Red Wizard of Thay in 1338 DR but history recounted that he "fell to the hordes of Phlan" only 2 years after. It was later in use by Rowena circa 1370 DR , who was also a Red Wizard.</p>
