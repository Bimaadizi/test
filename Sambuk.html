<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A sambuk typically had a keel length of around 75 feet (23 meters) long and had a beam or width of 20 feet (6.1 meters). Rather than a sterncastle, it had only a raised platform. Navigation was via a rudder at the stern and the lateen sails. It was slightly more reliable than a barijah , as it could be sailed in all seas.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

From these vessels, the corsairs launched a surprise attack on the Five Kingdoms, swiftly overrunning and seizing their defenseless port cities. Then legions of askar disembarked, beginning the Scouring of the Utter East . By the end, his forces boarded their sambuks and sailed home again.</p>
