<p>In the late 1360s DR , Kalorc and his young assistant Beribold were hired by the lord of Auckney , Feringal Auck , to cure the condition of Biaste Ganderlay known as the wilting . His assistant was successful, and Kalorc assessed that the condition had been completely cured.</p>
<p>The senior priest initiated the noble marriage ceremony between Lord Feringal and his bride, Meralda Ganderlay . However, it was interrupted by the young Jaka Sculi , who appeared on a cliff above, declaring his love for the bride. The groom requested Risten to magically silence the man, but the distance to Jaka was over the limit of the spell's range, and he did not have it prepared. After Jaka fell from the cliff, the ceremony was cancelled.</p>
