<p>Leech was a cursed polearm found in the centre west of Darkmoon 's silver tower.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In combat, the polearm would make its owner miss more often than they would with a regular polearm, equivalent to a weapon with a -2 enchantment.</p>
<p>The room containing Leech could only be found via a secret mechanism in a room full of flying snakes . Once the button was located and pressed, a door would swing upon, revealing the cursed polearm.</p>
<p>Either Leech or Hunger was required as the key to solving a riddle, requested by an animated mouth. Once the weapon was fed to the mouth, it was possible to progress further into Temple Darkmoon.</p>
