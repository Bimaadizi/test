<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In addition to serving as a flaming weapon, a critical strike against a foe triggered an explosion of fire against them. It would do this even if the flames were not sheathing the blade.</p>
<p>The flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition fired from them.</p>
