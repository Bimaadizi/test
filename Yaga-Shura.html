<p>Yaga-Shura was a fire giant Bhaalspawn and a member of the group known as the Five . He commanded a powerful army of giants from his keep within the Marching Mountains .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The powerful giant owned a number of powerful weapons and pieces of armor. Among these were a powerful +4 runehammer , the Shield of the Order , along with the plate armor of Shuruppak , chosen of Gilgeam .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yaga-Shura was raised by a human witch called Nyalee . She helped him achieve invulnerability by means of a ritual that involved setting the fire to his heart. Yaga-Shura did not show much gratitude, taking her magically removed heart with him as a way to prevent her from undoing the magic.</p>
<p>The defense of his keep was led by a fire giant mage named Berenn .</p>
<p>Quite fittingly, Yaga-Shura was an associate of Imix , the Prince of Elemental Evil.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Bhaalspawn crisis , Yaga-Shura took control of at least some of the fire giants in the Marching Mountains , recruiting many more to his army. He left some others to guard the temple-enclave that housed his heart.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Yaga-Shura and the Five began to hunt down any Bhaalspawn they found, leaving death and chaos in their wake, thus beginning the Bhaalspawn crisis . At the same time, the Bhaalist priestess Amelyssan gathered others into the Tethyrian city of Saradush under the guise of offering them protection from the carnage.</p>
<p>The city's ruler was a paranoid Bhaalspawn named Gromnir Il-Khan , who prevented anyone from entering into or leaving Saradush. Yaga-Shura and his fire giant army besieged the city but were thwarted by a magical barrier created by Gromnir's head wizard .</p>
<p>While Yaga-Shura was assaulting Saradush, his fellow Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian journeyed into the Marching Mountains and recovered Yaga-Shura's heart, ending the fire giant's state of invulnerability. Yaga-Shura was subsequently slain within his siege camp, after having finally sacked Saradush. He was the second of the Five to have been slain by Abdel Adrian and his companions.</p>
