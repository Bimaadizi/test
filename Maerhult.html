<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , he visited The Drunken Dragon tavern in the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast . There he met the adventurer Shaless , who was displaying a selection of curious harps and beautiful, magical blades that she'd apparently looted from devils in Myth Drannor . Maerhult examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor, and to be rare magical items.</p>
