<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Exeltis Ice Wine was considered one of the best wines in the Realms . The ice wine was fermented using the juice of small grey grapes that were cultivated along the Blade Cliffs, the lands that surrounded Castle Exeltis .</p>
<p>The wine was aged in enormous wooden kegs in the castle's basements before being bottled in fanciful bottles of blueish and purple glass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original recipe for Exeltis Ice Wine was developed by Cedric Exeltis . The Exeltis family continued production of the fine red wine for several generations that followed. By 1372 DR , the Exeltis clan and their wine business were in decline. Due to its quality, reputation, and rarity, Exeltis Ice Wine was considered an extremely rare and valuable vintage.</p>
