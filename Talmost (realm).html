<p>Talmost was a small human realm in northwest Faer√ªn , created from the destruction of the kingdom of Delimbiyran in 697 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Talmost lay between the southern Dessarin Valley and Delimbiyr Vale on the northeast edge of the Ardeep Forest , in the former territory of Delimbiyran.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Talmost was originally a territory of the kingdom of Delimbiyran . Succeeding Phalorm in 616 DR , Delimbiyran overtook many of the lands formerly held by the dwarven and elven realms of Dardath and Ardeep . The land's Talmost family was ennobled either shortly before 615 DR , or in 659 DR , ruling from Talmost Keep near the House of Stone .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Triton's Horn, 697 DR , the Sharran high priestess Lalondra Worul became a lich , in the process killing her faithful True Servants of Shar who controlled an extensive network of Sharran temples across the Sword Coast . Completely uncontrolled, the leaderless faithful of her church caused mayhem and destruction across the region, and threatened numerous cities and realms. When King Davyd Snowsword of Delimbiyran deployed his soldiers in force to counter the violence, he was assassinated by a Sharran fanatic turned martyr. Dying without an heir, King Davyd's realm fell into civil war and broke apart into the small, independent realms of Talmost, Calandor , Scathril , Harpshield , Loravatha , Dauntylgar , Secomber , and more lost to history. The Talmosts continued to rule their territory as independent royalty.</p>
<p>Shortly after in the Year of the Clutching Death, 702 DR , an orcish force from the High Forest invaded and destroyed several of the weakened and disunited claimants. The Duke of Calandor managed to form an alliance with his rivals, and together they threw back the invasion. Though the surviving realms remained independent, their wars largely ended thanks to this instance of cooperation.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Circling Vulture, 942 DR , drow raiders struck hard along the Sword Coast , with Talmost and Harpshield pillaged and the people enslaved. The Talmost Lands were ravaged, and the royal family fled and resettled in Nimoar's Hold , though they maintained their ownership of the ancestral lands. They became officially ennobled in Waterdeep the same year and became one of the leading families of the city.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the other realms of Delimbiyran had largely fallen to ruin, with only Daggerford and Secomber remaining prominent. Talmost Keep lay in ruins, though the Talmosts maintained hunting lodges and employed crofters to herd sheep and cattle in the Talmost Lands.</p>
