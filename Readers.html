<p>The Readers were a religious organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Zann , the Zakharan god of learning and intelligence.</p>
<p>The Readers did not have a favored weapon or symbol.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As anchorite mystics , these fanatical devotees of Zann found Enlightenment through prodigious reading. The simple act of reading granted them their clerical powers; retention and comprehension of the subject matter was not required to gain access to their powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Readers started several holy crusades over their 400-year existence.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Readers were based in Huzuz , because the City of Delights had the best centers of learning in all of Zakhara. However, they could be found in any city that had a university or other renowned place of learning. They also maintained a strong presence within the Mosque of Zann the Wise .</p>
