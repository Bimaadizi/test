<p>Drowned Buoy was an inn in the Lower Port of Skullport .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Drowned Buoy was a budget-friendly lodging option, offering a large, communal room where sailors on limited funds could set up a hammock or spread out a bedroll. The establishment provided minimal amenities at a cost of 1 copper piece per night. Food and drink was not served on the premises, but could be obtained at nearby establishments like Findlewulf's Galley and the Burning Troll . Security was nonexistent, and patrons were responsible for the safety of their own belongings, as the management assumed no liability for lost or stolen items or companions.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The owner of the inn, Wallid "Wally" Gumluk , was rumored to supplement his income by cooperating with Zstulkk Ssarmn ’s jailers— yuan-ti slavers—and press gangs who sought laborers for rowing decks and ship crews destined for distant locations. This rumored connection has lent the Drowned Buoy a certain notoriety, which made it a favored haunt for those requiring discretion in their dealings, though it remained a less desirable lodging for those wary of Skullport’s darker elements.</p>
