<p>Velgorn Kataclath was the Magister from 601 DR to 607 DR . He became the Haunted Flagon so he would not have to continue struggling to defend the title.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to becoming Magister, Velgorn Kataclath was the seneschal of a stronghold which his adventuring band used as a stop. He had been part of that band once, but had since retired, hoping to become a farmer.</p>
<p>Velgorn acquired the title while defending his stronghold from an invading Ozgor Hyelvel , without seeking it. Soon after the fight, challengers who had been grown in power during Ozgor's tenure decided to challenge the new magister; in the process, they laid waste to much of what Velomar had been sworn to protect. He eventually fled his home to draw these challengers away from it.</p>
<p>He soon tired nonetheless, and talked to Mystra. He decided to promote magic as a wild thing, rather than as a tool to gain power over lesser beings; Mystra agreed to transform him into the Haunted Flagon and find a new Magister .</p>
