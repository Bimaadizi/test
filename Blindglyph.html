<p>A blindglyph was a powerful handglyph weapon favored by the Geomancers of Kadar used to blind their enemies.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A blindglyph stored the power of the power word, blind spell , unleashing it at an enemy when presented and the proper command word was uttered. The wielder selected a target to serve as the center of the blindglyph's power. Anything within a 15 ft (4.6 m) radius of that center was temporarily blinded for up to an hour.</p>
<p>These handglyphs could not be recharged.</p>
