<p>Herdsman genies were special tasked genies in Zakhara who tended animals.</p>
<p>Herdsmen were descendants of the jann .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These sociable genies were short and wiry with heavy brows. Years of sun exposure left their skin dark and tanned. Herdsman genies often smelled like their animals but with a slight rancid odor because of all of the milk products that they consumed.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These genies only entered combat for self defense or in defense of their herds. They were proficient with a variety of weaponry including short bows , spears , short swords , and lassos . They could use the following spell-like abilities: phantom steed , dust devil , remove fear , and flame brand .</p>
<p>Herdsman genies were adept at firing bows from the back of a horse or camel while riding at full speed.</p>
<p>In desperate situations a herdsman genie would attempt to create a stampede and charge an enemy.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These genies were solitary unless a larger herd required assistance to manage. They would only disobey their masters if the safety of their herds was at stake.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Most of their diet consisted of blood carefully taken from their charges. Animal milk was used to make a wide variety of food as well.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Herdsman genies moved often if grazing was not suitable for their animals. They did not care for artificial boundaries created by humanoids , which often led them into conflicts.</p>
