<p>Fireguard Fortress was an ancient dwarfhold that was built into the side of Mount Hotenow on the Sword Coast North .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was built within the northern side of the volcano's caldera, northwest of the Shattered Peak . Dwarven architecture surrounding the rocky cliffside in which the entrance to the fortress was set.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The stone-and-metal was built above a massive flow of blazing-hot magma. After the eruption of the mountain, portions of its power chambers were completely overtaken by the magma flow and entirely inaccessible by most beings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Set within the mountain itself, Fireguard Fortress combined dwarven stone architecture and impressive metalwork. Not only did the fortress itself weather both the intense heat and harsh volcanic environment, but it featured prodigious use of mechanical engineering. Navigation throughout the fortress in part utilized mechanical levers that raised or lowered large stone platforms that allowed entrance onto certain passageways.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While the original purpose and specifications of the dwarven fortress were lost to the ages, it served as a military stronghold as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fireguard Fortress dated back to the ancient dwarven kingdom of Delzoun that flourished during the Age of the Proud People . After Delzoun's fall, the fortress remained lost and untouched for many years until Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR .</p>
<p>The discovery of lost dwarfholds within Mount Hotenow spurred the dwarves Clan Hillborn to lead an expedition into the volcanic mountain and recover some of their lost heritage. Before Vandra Hillborn and her clansman made it to Fireguard however, the great fortress was seized by the mad giant Gommoth and the cult of Maegera . The fire archon general Ignazar was granted dominion over Fireguard Fortress, using the ancient stronghold to house and train his legion of elemental soldiers.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the displaced Hillborn dwarves, which had since found a new home in the city of Neverwinter , the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was enlisted by Sergeant Knox of the Neverwinter Guard . The hero ventured from the city to the dwarven camp at Mount Hotenow, and helped them drive Gommoth and his cultists out from their numerous strongholds so they could take back the ancestral home of their clan.</p>
