<p>Phlogiston Physical properties Material type Ethereal fluid Color Multicolored Properties Highly flammable Phlogiston ( pronounced : / f l oʊ ˈ dʒ ɪ s t ʌ n / flo-JIS-tun listen ) was a term that could either refer to the space between the crystal spheres of the Prime Material Plane or to the flammable fluid that permeated it, a rainbow-colored chaotic material that surrounded the spheres. Bizarre creatures inhabited it and preyed on spelljammers traveling between spheres. Spacefarers sometimes called the phlogiston the flow or the Rainbow Ocean .</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The phlogiston was an opaque, brilliant, multicolored ether that did not resemble any of the four elements. It could not exist inside crystal spheres and quickly dissipated if brought inside, although it did permeate into a spelljammer's air envelope while it sailed through the phlogiston. It also could not be reproduced. Most importantly, it was an extremely flammable substance. Any spark or flame, magical or otherwise, immediately exploded, violently igniting the ship and its surrounding area. Because of this, travelers always extinguished their flames before leaving their crystal spheres. Enclosed areas of ships could only be illuminated by magical or flameless lights, such as those produced by fireflies .</p>
<p>Because of the obscuring nature of the phlogiston, crystal spheres were usually not visible during most of the duration of a trip. They only became visible at very close distances and, due to their enormous sizes, always appeared like perfectly flat walls with no apparent curvature.</p>
<p>The phlogiston also completely blocked access to other planes . It was impossible to access another plane while in the flow, even the extradimensional space created by a Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion spell or a magical item such as a portable hole . Except through the use of powerful magic such as a limited wish spell or similar, those regions remained inaccessible until the user returned to wildspace , which supported extraplanar travel normally. It was also unclear whether the phlogiston touched the border of the Ethereal plane .</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>The phlogiston was far from homogeneous. The fluid itself varied in its density from place to place and also displayed river-like flows, sometimes connecting objects such as the crystal spheres themselves within them. Spelljammers could make use of this flow to greatly increase their speeds through the vast distances within the phlogiston. Increasing the contact area with the flow to acquire greater speed was also the reason some spelljamming ships had sails.</p>
<p>The crystal spheres floated freely in the phlogiston, sometimes enough to significantly change their positions with respect to each other over time. The flow, however, remained unaltered, so navigation between the spheres remained possible. Many of these rivers flowed in both directions, but some flowed in only one way, forcing a return trip to take a different route.</p>
<h3>Navigation and Travel</h3>
<p>Travel in the Flow was as followed: ships that traveled the Flow like spelljammers were capable of moving incredibly fast through it. However, it was difficult to document the speeds of spelljammers because the Flow was simply an empty vacuum with no discernable landmarks or places of interest. As such, the only way to measure how fast a spelljammer's speed could reach was by measuring how long it took for a ship to reach a crystal sphere from another, as the concept of time was the only form of stable measurement.</p>
<p>Many travelers used locator devices to navigate the Flow, and these devices were either created and given by the Arcane , or were created through duplication spells. Unless a locator device was used to find specific locations, many spelljammers would swim randomly in the endless Rainbow Ocean and end up reaching a random destination. Generally, in order for a spelljammer to reach any random crystal sphere from its closest neighbor, it would take any amount of time ranging from 10 days to 100 days, although exceptions to the average did exist. These days were a Spelljammer's main unit of distance.</p>
<p>Most crystal spheres randomly floated in the phlogiston. However, in rare cases, stable configurations existed that ensured reliable routes between spheres. By the mid‒14 th century DR , only three such configurations were commonly known to spacefarers, but there were at least several others. However, many times, crystal spheres wouldn't stay within proximity of each other for very long, constantly entering and exiting each other's range, meaning that travelers were not guaranteed to reach an area simply because it was attained once. Some spheres weren't directly reachable from others; this was due to the Flow inherently having its own system of flow rivers that carried crystal spheres randomly and carried material in structured directions. As such, travelers had to reach said crystal spheres through an indirect method; a common form of indirect travel was traveling through multiple spheres to circumvent their roadblocks.</p>
<p>The Phlogiston had naturally occurring phenomena called Major flow rivers , which were the continuous, directed movement of the Flow that guided crystal spheres into predictable movements and thus created predictable stable configurations, akin to ocean currents. Each major flow river had a predominate color that corresponded with an area’s flow; because the color was noticeable (and also didn't mix with intersecting Flow rivers), it was easy to find and ride the flow towards a destination, and thus traveling through these rivers was considered one of the easiest methods of traveling across the Phlogiston. An example of a major flow river would be the Arcane Inner Flow and the Arcane Outer Flow .</p>
<p>The Arcane Inner Flow was a Major Flow River that was located very close to Realmspace. It encompassed nearly a dozen crystal spheres, including Refuge , a close neighbor of Realmspace and the site of a spaceport controlled by the Arcane , as well as Pirtelspace and the elven -controlled sphere of Darnannon . Sometimes, crystal spheres wandering in the phlogiston became temporary or permanent members of the Inner Flow. The Arcane Outer Flow and was believed to include over 100 crystal spheres. Safe routes between the Inner and the Outer Flow were known only to the Arcane.</p>
<h3>Configurations in the Flow</h3>
<p>One such stable configuration was a triangle consisting of Realmspace , in which Toril was located; Greyspace , where the world of Oerth was found; and Krynnspace , home to the world of Krynn . The phlogiston had a strong current that flowed between Realmspace and Greyspace, making two-way travel between the two crystal spheres relatively simple. There were one-way flows from Greyspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Realmspace, but not in the opposite directions. Due to this current, it was impossible to travel directly from Realmspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Greyspace. From Greyspace, however, it was a relatively simple matter to travel to either Realmspace or Krynnspace, strong currents leading to both spheres. For that reason, traveling from Realmspace to Krynnspace was easier if one went through Greyspace first instead of going directly. Recorded travel times indicate that in order for someone to travel from Krynnspace to Realmspace, it would take them around 53 days aboard a spelljammer (SJD).</p>
<h3>Dark Regions</h3>
<p>Some areas of the phlogiston contained vast clouds of negative energy known as Dark Regions . One particularly dangerous Dark Region was located between the Vodoni Empire and the Realmspace triangle and was known as the Weird . It was inhabited by the Zalani ghost ship Lady Lenore .</p>
