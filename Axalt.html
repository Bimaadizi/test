<p>Axalt was a Revered Counselor of Nexal who ruled over the empire in its most prosperous era in the early-to-mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Axalt ascended the throne in the Year of the Blue Flame, 1327 DR at a young age, similarly to his ancestor, Ipana III some two centuries prior. The new Revered Counselor was the grandson of Chalco , the previous ruler of Nexal. The boy's tutors convinced the noblemen of Nexal that despite his youth, he had the keen mind and great instincts of a true ruler.</p>
<p>Like so many of his predecessors, Revered Counselor Axalt faced Kultaka several times in minor conflicts, yet none were as successful as the war waged by his grandfather. The old adversary of Chalco, now the Revered Counselor of Kultaka, Takamal was unbeatable in the game of strategy, leaving the Kultakans still unsubjugated. Axalt's own son, Naltecona , was the general who led several of these campaigns.</p>
<p>However, it was not military conquests that made Axalt the great leader he was. The Revered Counselor oversaw the creation of the grand palace in Nexal, later referred to as the Palace of Axalt , as well as the Aqueduct of Axalt that carried fresh water from Cicada Spring 8 miles (13 kilometers) away to the center of the city. Fresh water was made available to all citizens and benefited the city greatly.</p>
<p>The Revered Counselor Axalt died still a young man in the Year of the Bridle, 1349 DR . He left Nexal in a relatively peaceful state and the empire at its strongest. Nexal was paid tribute by the subjugated Pezelac , Huacli , and Kolan with no rebellions, and traders did business with faraway Payit . The rule was passed along to his son Naltecona, the last Revered Counselor of Nexal, who was killed in Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , by the Golden Legion of Amn .</p>
