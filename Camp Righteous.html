<p>Camp Righteous was an Order of the Gauntlet military outpost in Chult that was established, and destroyed, during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The camp was located on the River Soshenstar in the northern regions of the Chultan jungles. It was built around the Chultan structure known as the House of the Crocodile .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>It had no defensive structures, a fact that contributed to its fall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before it's abandonment, the camp was led by an arrogant commander whose decisions cost the lives of many of her templars. Then, a matter of months before the death curse was set upon Faerûn , Camp Righteous was overrun by undead leaving only a few survivors who fled south to Camp Vengeance . The commander lost her life in this retreat, but rose again as a revenant obsessed with pursuing her former subordinates, believing they had betrayed her.</p>
<p>Following its destruction, the camp was watched over the batiri goblin boss Yakka and her tribe, who took up residence within the House of the Crocodile.</p>
