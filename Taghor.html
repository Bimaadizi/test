<p>Taghor was a warrior of King Teirgoh , and fought with him against the dark elves beneath Waterdeep . Whilst trying to stop the drow from assaulting the royal family, he almost met his death at the blade of a drow. He may have later been healed by the party setting out to slay Xanathar , and if so, he informed them that his king was grievously wounded, and Prince Keirgar had been kidnapped. He thanked the adventurers for saving him from death, but could not offer them a reward, as he had become separated from his clan during the battle. The fighter offered to join the adventurers, and told them whereabouts his clan had settled on the lower level.</p>
