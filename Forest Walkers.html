<p>Forest Walkers were enchanted boots used by Rashemaar foresters.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These powerful boots possessed a collection of enchantments that made it easy for the wearers to dance freely across even the most overgrown and thorny dense forests. They dramatically improved wearers' dexterity and granted them magical protection against bludgeoning damage. Additionally, the wearer was able to cast the freedom of movement spell thrice per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Forest Walkers were used by Rashemaar berserkers stationed in the Ashenwood's Lake of Tears Garrison , a Rashemi fort led by a wychlaran named Dalenka . Odesya , the fort's requisitions officer, offered a pair of the magic boots for sale to the fort's allies.</p>
