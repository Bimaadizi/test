<p>Venomtail poison was a potent poison used by the assassins and hunters of Port Nyanzaru in Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The poison was extracted from the giant and rare venomtail scorpions native to the Chultan jungle, especially around the River Soshenstar . The poison itself was thus regarded as a trophy among hunters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the sale of venomtail poison in Port Nyanzaru was strictly controlled by the merchant prince Jessamine . Even so, some hunters were known to trade it amongst themselves, notably Doriak of the Shells , who would exchange it for flasks of sulfur that could be used to lure out fire scorpions .</p>
