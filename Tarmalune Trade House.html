<p>The Tarmalune Trade House , also known as the Tarmalune Auction House , was a trade cartel from Tarmalune that operated out of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Trade House had a large warehouse located in the Docks District to store their wares. They also had an open-air auction post located in the Protector's Enclave .</p>
<p>The Tarralune merchants used a unique type of currency, Tarmalune Trade Bars , which were made of silver and were imprinted with Tarralune trade markings. The bars could be exchanged for equipment, mounts, adventuring contracts, and other valuable items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , once Neverwinter's Docks were repaired, members of a trade cartel from the Laerakondan city of Tarmalune of the Windrise Ports arrived in Neverwinter and arranged trade deals with Dagult Neverember , in the hopes of creating permanent trade ties between their homeland and Faerûn , and to outmaneuver their rivals from another Laerakondan city, Lylorn , who had landed in Luskan with similar goals.</p>
<p>Unrelated to the intrigues of Neverwinter, the Tarralune merchants provided a peaceful place to make trade deals and soon became vital for trade in Neverwinter, especially among adventurers . They also sought out trade deals with nobles and merchants from Waterdeep .</p>
