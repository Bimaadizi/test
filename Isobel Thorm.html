<p>Isobel Thorm was a half-elf cleric of Selûne and daughter of general Ketheric Thorm . Isobel was killed some time in the 14 th century DR , leading to her father's conversion to the church of Shar and later Myrkul . She was resurrected in the late 15 th century DR as part of Ketheric's pact with Myrkul and subsequently assisted the resistance against the Absolute .</p>
<h2>Power</h2>
<p>As an experienced cleric of Selûne, Isobel was capable of channeling divine energy from moonlight to create a type of protection magic called Moonshield, which helped her create a safe space within the deadly Shadow-cursed lands . She could also bless individual beings and grant them protection over the weaker shadow curse from harming them.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>When she was alive and well, Isobel loved and admired her father, Ketheric Thorm . She was grateful for all the guidance and care her father gave to her. After being resurrected by Ketheric, her love and admiration toward her father were gone. She was disgusted and frightened by how wicked and twisted her father had become.</p>
<p>Isobel had a romantic relationship with Dame Aylin , the divine daughter of goddess Selûne herself. She fell in love with Aylin at the first sight when Aylin visited her hometown ; the feeling was mutual. However, Ketheric disapproved of the relationship; officially because he feared the difference in their lifespans would cause Isobel heartache, but really due to his own jealousy and protectiveness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Isobel grew up in a Selûnite family with father Ketheric and mother Melodia in Reithwin . Unfortunately, her mother died very young. Isobel was raised and taught to be a Selûne cleric by Ketheric alone. As a young adult, Isobel was murdered by unknown assailants, making Ketheric mentally collapse and convert his faith from Selûne to her dark sister, Shar, and (eventually) to the death god Myrkul. After being dead and buried, Isobel found herself waking up in a dusty coffin with her changed father looming over her. She was also informed by Ketheric that Aylin was dead. Frightened and terrified by how her father had changed, she ran away from the Thorm Mausoleum and created herself a safe space in the Last Light inn within the Shadow-cursed lands.</p>
<p>Eventually her safe space got the attention of Jaheira and her Harpers who came to investigate the Cult of the Absolute . From the information she was given, she realized that she had been dead over a century and her father was the source of the Shadow curse . She also noticed some tainted energy within herself after the resurrection and only could recall the darkness of her death. Knowing what was at stake, Isobel allied with Jaheira and her subordinates and helped them in dealing with the Cult of the Absolute.</p>
