<p>A rod of tuning was a magical rod .</p>
<p>It could produce any tuning note, which was useful for bards or clerics of Milil when tuning musical instruments, but it was also capable of creating other, magical notes, with powerful effects. Once per day it could create a note that acted as a holy word spell to any evil creatures within 30 feet (10 m). Also, once per day it could create a note that acted as a banishment spell to outsiders within 30 feet. This note had three aspects that the creature hated. The rod could also act as a focus for any song-based or sonic spell.</p>
