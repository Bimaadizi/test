<p>The Riders of Blood were renegades from the House of Hanif who operated along Dihl al-Taif in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Located somewhere within the Haunted Lands , the Riders of Blood struck with the speed and savage efficiency of a sandstorm.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Because of their dislike of the subjugation of their tribe to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz , the Riders of Blood frequently targeted trade caravans traveling between Huzuz and Halwa .</p>
<p>All potential caravan targets were carefully scouted before any attack was made. A favored tactic was to have several wind mages batter the caravans with wind and sand for a few days before striking with lancers and bowmen.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Riders of Blood fielded 250 skilled fighting men and women and several wizards. Fasim Kaldur was their leader.</p>
<p>Many of the Riders favored the jambiya since it was a symbol of freedom throughout the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Though most of its members were humans, elves and half-elves were welcomed so long as they proved their loyalty to the Riders.</p>
