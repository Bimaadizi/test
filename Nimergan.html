<p>Nimergan was a species of fungus that grew in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nimergan grew in irregular patches 8‒12 ft (2.4‒3.7 m) in diameter and only 1‒3 in (2.5‒7.6 cm) tall. It resembled a beige, frayed umbrella with dark brown bumps on the stem.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Mature nimergan was sealed into a cask to die. The brown bumps were actually a parasitic fungus that fed upon the stem and fermented into a potent alcohol that could be consumed. Nimergan that was allowed to ferment too long could actually form an alcohol so potent that it could kill.</p>
<p>Duergar were especially fond of the drink, which was also known as nimergan. They were known to challenge outsiders to a drinking contest of the more potent version of the alcohol. Being more resistant to its effects, the duergar, more often than not, watched as their opponent went into a coma and sometimes died from over-indulgence.</p>
<p>Nimergan was sold for 1 electrum piece per glass, or 10 gold pieces per glass for the rarer, but more potent, version.</p>
