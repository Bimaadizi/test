<p>House Uluuthin was a rich and influential merchant family of Alaghôn in Turmish .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the politically tumultuous past of the Turmish nation, House Uluuthin was among the noble merchant clans contending for the Princedom. House Uluuthin lost three of its scions in the 14 th century DR after the family purchased a magical tome excavated from a tomb complex underneath the city of Jathrin's Jump . The tombs were used as a temple of Talos , with an undead High Priest Aragath Taltar helming the worship. The book was Aragath's diary, and after getting the tome, Uluuthin house members spread word of Aragath's undead state sometime circa the Year of Storms, 1310 DR . Mysteriously, three young lords of House Uluuthin perished while adventuring and Aragath felt cheated, unable to slay them himself.</p>
