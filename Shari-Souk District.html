<p>Shari-Souk District was the name of the market quarter of the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The market sat outside of Madinat . All of the buying and selling of Dhaztanar occured here, making it the true life of the city. Walls were erected throughout the market to offer protection, but their planning was poor, resulting in a haphazard effort. Various canals passed through the market, adding to the confusion of the layout.</p>
