<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in early 1370 DR , Azetlin's tribe was pushed out from their home to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain . On the tribe's "king," the kobolds started raiding and thieving in Waterdeep . That year, one of the 5 th of Eleint Azetlin the scribe documented one of such thieving expeditions to the surface. The recorded raid was unsuccessful as the kobolds were scared off by a City Watch dwarf with a glowing in the moonlight magical blade. Some minor stolen supplies were traded to a gray orc for food, and the kobolds planned another raid the following night. During the same period of time, the area of the Undermountain they were forced to relocate to was flooded, making some of the tribe's kobolds "sneeze-sick," which only added to the kobolds' struggles.</p>
