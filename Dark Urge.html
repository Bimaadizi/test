<p>The Dark Urge was the name given to a white dragonborn Bhaalspawn sorcerer —and the chosen of Bhaal ―who lived in the Realms during the late 15 th century DR . The name referred to the murderous and violent urges he received during many events he encountered in his life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a white dragonborn, the Dark Urge could use a cold breath weapon, and was resistant to cold damage. He was also a storm sorcerer .</p>
<p>Like other Bhaalspawn, the Dark Urge had at least the capability of transforming into a bestial form of the Slayer , one avatar of the Lord of Murder. This could be done at will, but was only gifted by Bhaal at his choosing.</p>
<p>As a True Soul , the Dark Urge could use mind flayer tadpole abilities.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The goblin -like creature Sceleritas Fel served the Dark Urge and joined him during a series of grisly murders in Baldur's Gate . Sceleritas was deeply devoted to the Dark Urge and found great pride in serving him. He even claimed to share in the Dark Urge's more intimate moments and that the Dark Urge was a necrophiliac. In fact, the simple question of serving another Bhaalspawn like Orin the Red made Sceleritas so queasy that he asked for the "bucket of Bhaal" to vomit in.</p>
<p>The Dark Urge had a turbulent relationship with his divine sister Orin. It was implied by Zethino (in fact, a shapechanged Orin) that the Dark Urge and Orin had a close relationship, with the Dark Urge being impressed by Orin's skill. However, they disagreed on Bhaal's doctrine and the manner of killing.</p>
<p>The Dark Urge commanded respect, admiration, and devotion from the cultists at the Temple of Bhaal in Baldur's Gate, inspiring them with his ruthlessness, many victims, and his cunning plans. Naaber and Sceleritas Fel claimed that Bhaal himself loved the Dark Urge the most of all his children as he had personally created him as the perfect son, compared to past Bhaalspawn.</p>
<p>With a relationship built on mutual respect, the Dark Urge and Enver Gortash were allies in their schemes. The two of them hatched the entire plan for creating the cult of the Absolute . When Orin betrayed the Dark Urge, Gortash was unaware of what happened, only what Orin told him and that she had made a fool of the Dark Urge. When coming face to face with the Dark Urge for the first time since then, he appeared genuinely happy to see him.</p>
<p>The Absolute , an illithid elder brain , had a fairly positive relationship with the Dark Urge, whom it viewed as the kingmaker that crowned it. It also admired the Dark Urge's desires and methodology, even hinting that, had he still been in charge of the conspiracy of, it would have gone along with his plans more readily.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Unlike previous Bhaalspawn who had been conceived by mortal women, the Dark Urge was created directly by Bhaal from his own divine blood in a form of 'divine parthenogenesis'. Sceleritas Fel dismissed other Bhaalspawn like Orin and Sarevok Anchev as "weeds that sprung from Bhaal's loins". Sarevok also mentioned that the Dark Urge was the "purest" of the Bhaalspawn. The sheer blood-lust that he displayed impressed his father, who declared the Dark Urge to be his favored child. According to the Dark Urge's own thoughts, he was created to be the last being alive, that he would finally kill himself after slaughtering the whole world in Bhaal's name.</p>
<p>However, not being born within a Temple of Bhaal like Orin had been, the Dark Urge was left to make his way in the world alone. As an abandoned child, he was eventually adopted by a Baldurian family and lived a normal childhood until the urge manifested. It is not clear what happened to his foster family, but the Dark Urge believed that they were among his first victims. Some time after that, he was drafted into the Temple of Bhaal.</p>
<h3>Killing Time</h3>
<p>According to Sceleritas, he was first sent by Bhaal to serve the Dark Urge when he reached the age of maturity in order to guide him to his destiny. After their meeting, the two traveled the world, committing many murders and assassinations in the name of Bhaal.</p>
<p>In Flamerule of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , the Dark Urge murdered several people in Baldur's Gate, including Tav , an adventurer who was investigating said murders. The Dark Urge also faked his death by killing another dragonborn and using the corpse as bait to mislead investigators.</p>
<p>In a plot devised by the Dark Urge, he and Enver Gortash went on a raid of Mephistopheles 's vault to steal the Crown of Karsus with help from the diabolist Helsik of Devil's Fee .</p>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Dark Urge was attacked by Orin the Red, one of Bhaal's other mortal children. Orin split open her sibling's skull and usurped the Dark Urge's role as Bhaal's Chosen and joined forces with two other chosen servants of the Dead Three . It was unknown if the dragonborn survived the attack. [ speculation ]</p>
<h3>Potential Future</h3>
<p>His body may had been left a dead plaything in Orin's bedroom in the Temple of Bhaal. However, if the Dark Urge were to survive, the attack would've left him with nearly no memories of his life. If that were the case, in an attempt to enslave him, Orin could've implanted him with a mind flayer tadpole—making him the first to be implanted by the the Absolute. This infectious would result in the Dark Urge being left alone in the illithid colony underneath Moonrise Towers , until he was found by the Myrkulite necromancer Kressa Bonedaughter . Kressa then would surely have fixed the Dark Urge enough for survival and used him as the experimental subject for tadpole modification. Unlike other victims of the illithids who were completely subdued, the Dark Urge would be half conscious sometimes and attempted to free himself violently while trapped. Eventually, the Dark Urge would be sent away by an illithid nautiloid by Balthazar 's command.</p>
<p>The nautiloid eventually went to Yartar , capturing civilians to become illithids, where it came under attack by githyanki and their red dragon mounts. The nautiloid escaped into the Nine Hells , where it was attacked by cambions led by Commander Zhalk , under orders of Zariel . If the Dark Urge survived, he would've awoken on the nautiloid, suffering from amnesia , and encountered an infected githyanki fighter named Lae'zel , when they both discovered that the mind flayer tadpoles in their heads allowed them to communicate telepathically, and potentially a infected half-elf cleric named Shadowheart , who possessed an artifact . Together, the group escaped the Hells by getting to the control center and teleporting the nautiloid back to Faerûn , where it crashed into the banks of the River Chionthar between Elturel and Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>After this, the Dark Urge woke and was disappointed that his memories had not returned, feared his desires, and was desperate to find the truth, and be rid of the mind flayer tadpole. He potentially regrouped with Shadowheart, where they discussed needing to find someone to heal them, and along the way, they could've met an infected high elf rogue named Astarion and an infected human wizard named Gale . If so, the Dark Urge felt the desire to cut off Gale's hand and kill him; he may have resisted or given in. On their way to find someone to heal them, the party could potentially save or kill Lae'zel, who'd been captured by some tieflings . The party could also find a crypt once used to worship Jergal . Inside was a tomb that had the undead being Withers resting inside. He questioned the party about the worth of a single mortal's life, and promised to see them again soon.</p>
<p>After the party left, they found a group under attack by a pack of goblins . If the goblins were defeated, a tiefling Hellrider named Zevlor let the party inside the Emerald Grove , but informed them that "outsiders" weren't welcome anymore. Zevlor said that druids were forcing everyone out and that the current temporary archdruid , Kagha , was interrogating a child named Arabella , who'd interrupted the Rite of Thorns by stealing the Idol of Silvanus ; the Dark Urge could let his Urge get Arabella killed, or spare her. Once inside, the party might find an infected human warlock named Wyll Ravengard . If Gale had grown to trust the Dark Urge enough, he asked for a magic item for him to consume, hinting that something bad would happen if he wasn't given one. The party could find out from another druid named Nettie that a powerful druid named Halsin , who was studying the mind flayer tadpoles, had been captured by the goblins and was at the goblins' camp. While traveling to the goblins' camp, the party met a cambion named Raphael , who told them that he could heal them, when they became desperate enough. As they slept for the night, one of their companions, either the tiefling bard Alfira , or the dragonborn bard Quil Grootslang , was murdered. The Dark Urge woke first and discovered the body, realizing the Urge had forced him to kill the bard. As the others awoke, they interrogated the Dark Urge as to what had happened. Moreover, during another rest, the Dark Urge awoke in severe pain, signaling ceremorphosis was taking place. If Lae'zel was present, she would take a knife to the Dark Urge and promise a merciful death to avoid becoming mind flayers and the Dark Urge would have to convince her not to do it. The Dark Urge would also be awoken by the Dream Guardian , a mysterious figure that promised to protect him and keep him and the party from becoming mind flayers. The Dream Guardian also tried to persuade the Dark Urge to use the mind flayer tadpole to unlock illithid powers. When they awoke, all the party members talked about having a similar dream.</p>
<p>After this, Astarion might have had the confidence to either try to suck the Dark Urge's blood or else admit that he is a vampire spawn . Moreover, the Dark Urge might awake one night and feel regret about killing Alfira or Quil, and go for a walk, when a fiend named Sceleritas Fel appeared and called the Dark Urge his master. He revealed he was the Dark Urge's "butler" and gifted him a present for killing the bard: the deathstalker mantle , a red cloak that turned the wearer invisible for a brief period after killing a being. Sceleritas said it was a gift from the Dark Urge's father, but was unable to reveal who his father actually was. Continuing on, the party could potentially meet a dog named Scratch .</p>
<p>The party eventually reached a town that had been ransacked by the Cult of the Absolute, where a group of goblins were intercepting travelers and searching them for a weapon they'd been tasked with finding. After making it through and jumping over a broken bridge, Gale, if present, would ask for another magic item, but felt it didn't satiate his condition. After fighting through some gnolls , the party could find a group of " paladins " of Tyr , who tasked the party with killing the tiefling that Wyll was hunting, an infected barbarian named Karlach and would reward the party with the sword of justice . The party could either choose to spare her, or kill her. If spared, Karlach would ask the party to help her kill the so-called "paladins"—in fact, hirelings serving Zariel. Later, the Absolute spoke to the party, revealing information about its "chosen", describing Ketheric Thorm, Enver Gortash, and Orin. But then Shadowheart's artifact glowed and blocked the Absolute from enthralling the party.</p>
<p>When they finally entered the goblin camp, the party would have two main choices: either free Halsin and defeat the goblin leaders, who were three True Souls (the goblin Gut , the hobgoblin Dror Ragzlin , and the drow Minthara , or tell Minthara where the Emerald Grove was, leading to a raid on the grove. There, the party either joined Minthara and helped her slaughter the tieflings and druids, or turned on Minthara, killing her there, and afterward celebrated with whomever they sided with. Next, the party were guided to Moonrise Towers in the shadow-cursed lands by traversing either through the Grymforge in the Underdark or through a mountain pass housing Rosymorn Monastery . It now held a crèche of githyanki, led by the Inquisitor W'wargaz . There they learned that a group of Sharran worshipers, including Shadowheart, had killed the githyanki who were carrying the Astral Prism , which was revealed to be the artifact Shadowheart was protecting.</p>
<p>When the party made it through either path, they found a weary traveler, in fact the wizard Elminster , who was looking for Gale. If there, Elminster told Gale that Mystra would consider forgiving him and grant him the power to control the Netherese destruction orb in his chest. The party then found themselves in the shadow-cursed lands, with the need for a light source to protect them. The party were met by either a goblin who led them to a drider named Kar'niss , who led them to Moonrise Towers , or by a group of Harpers being attacked by shadows .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Dark Urge once had a knife known as Stillmaker , which allowed him to cast hold person on two humanoids. Stillmaker was later found under the Open Hand Temple in the Rivington district of Baldur's Gate.</p>
