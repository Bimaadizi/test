<p>Ammalia Cassalanter ( pronounced : / ɑː ˈ m ɔː l i ɑː ˈ k ɑː s ɑː l ɑː n t ɛ r / ah-MAW-lee-ah KAS-ah-lan-ter ) was a Waterdhavian noble in the late 15 th century DR . She was the wife of Victoro Cassalanter .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ammalia was schooled in the arcane arts. Like her husband, she was the leader of a Cult of Asmodeus that involved certain nobles in Waterdeep .</p>
<p>During an average day, she normally tended to her garden, smoked on the balcony, dismally watching the ocean, or wept at a transformed Osvaldo 's feet in her mansion 's attic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1489 DR , the couple signed a contract with Asmodeus, in which they agreed to give up the souls of their children in exchange for power, good health, and long life. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a chain devil . Terenzio and Elzerina , their youngest twins, were also scheduled to be taken by the archdevil when they turned nine years old in 1492 DR , to be transformed into lemures . The only way to save the children was pay to the Hell a tremendous amount of coin and the souls of numerous people in sacrifice.</p>
<p>In 1492 Ammalia and her husband planned to recover the lost gold of Dagult Neverember and use it to buy back the souls of their children Meantime Ammalia planned to serve poison food during a party ousted during the Founders' Day celebration in order to gain the ninety-nine souls they need.</p>
<p>If Ammalia and Victoro presented in time the gold and the ninety-nine souls to a devil servant of Asmodeus the souls of Terenzio and Elzerina would be safe.</p>
