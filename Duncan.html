<p>Duncan was a merchant visiting the town of Wheloon in Cormyr in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Duncan visited the new Temple of Mystra and was among a group of people who partook in the three-day-long ritual of Mystra's Sacred Trust that the priests there were pushing, alongside eleven others: Durgen Glintstone , Kareem Hastith , Smote , Tholwick Styles , Dava , Mendios , Zephan , Veera Wavecrest , Halish , Kenniwick , and Amnic Basult . In the end, Starweaver Deinyn Fembrys dominated all of them with the Starry Gnosis , abducting them as part of a secret Sharran plot.</p>
<p>However, Duncan either resisted the effect or was deemed unsuitable, lacking any magical ability. Duncan, Kenniwick, and Amnic were tortured to death on a rack by Fembrys, then beheaded and had their heads stuffed and mounted in the mad priest's room. Eventually, on Eleint 6 , investigators found their bodies and identified them by their possessions.</p>
