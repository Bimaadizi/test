<p>Merrig was a salty old sea dog of a Captain from the city of Westgate , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Merrig was an old human man with hair whitened by age long before its time. His face was rugged and weathered by the sea and sun. Despite his intimidating look, Merrig was a jolly man with a wide, welcoming smile that hid his hardened inner steel. He was also said to be able to bring an ogre under the table.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Merrig was already an aged man. He could often be found in Westgate 's Black Eye Tavern , drinking ale and telling mariner stories. When questioned, Merrig claimed to be a "pirate hunter," but he was open to any lucrative business partnerships. He did not seem to care about the city guard finding out about his illicit operations.</p>
