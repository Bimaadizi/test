<p>Thelorn Selemban was a noble heir of Athalantar in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had a witty, yet acrid repartee.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was known to wear a shirt whose sleeves were embroidered with dragons.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a sword that broke through some protections.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He used to keep around six bodyguards around him, and rather favored needling fellow dandy Jansibal Otharr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , Thelorn Selemban went into the Kissing Wench , a tavern and den, where rival Jansibal Otharr was. There, he cut short a cruelty by Jansibal, which made the latter turn aggressive. The lordlings almost dueled, but for the intervention of the swordsman Adarbron of the guard, who bade them reconsider. Jansibal went back to his planned rutting with the coinlass Shandathe Llaerin , while Thelorn Selemban had a drink with Adarbron; however, he was then called on by Eladar the Dark, actually prince Elminster Aumar , who told him Shandathe had been left unsatisfied by Jansibal and would like to know him better. Taking the bait, Jansibal went into her stall, where he was knocked out, stripped, and thrown atop Jansibal.</p>
<p>Thelorn had taken to teasing Jansibal about this incident by the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , occassionally calling him "lover mine". On that year, he was in Castle Athalgard during the siege by the forces under Prince Elminster Aumar . During the attack, he came across Jansibal fighting Darrigo Trumpettower , and took the side against Jansibal; however, after Jansibal was slain by the invading Knights of Athalantar , Thelorn decided he stood against the rebels, and was in turn slain by Darrigo Trumpettower.</p>
