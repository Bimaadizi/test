It gave a broad benefit to the wearer's ability to avoid all sorts of danger, but its most obvious trait was the empowering of lightning, electricity, and air -based spells. A charge of electricity built up in the ring all the while, eventually lashing out to shock foes with a deadly blast of lightning.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ring was found in the ruins of Ildrannath's Tower during the fighting between the Elves of Cormanthor and Red Wizards of Droic Orgul , who each sought to control the city's mythal .</p>
