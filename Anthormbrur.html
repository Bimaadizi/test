<p>Anthormbrur was the name of the klathlaaedin (ornately carved stone mansion) belonging to the elite Horthander family located in Kh么ltar , south Faer没n circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This elegant compound was located on the northeast side of Hael Way on the point of land between Hael Way and the North Way . It backed up against Baharrokhbrur , the klathlaaedin belonging to the rival Khaundrove family, which faced North Way to the east. Southwest across the street was Harth Trithketh's House of Welcome . To the southeast was the huge expanse of the intersection of Hael Way and North Way, which both ended at Farrgaunlar, the southern gate through the double walls of Kh么ltar.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The eye-catching feature of this klathlaaedin was the central five-story needle-tower with its outer surface covered with leaping flames, human faces with watchful eyes, and many beasts, both mundane and monstrous, all carved into the stone. A squat, two-story attachment with a large, round window facing the courtyard connected the tower with the two wings. Both wings were sturdy three-floor rectangular buildings with sharply peaked roofs that formed a wide angle embracing the courtyard and gardens. The once-extensive enclosed gardens were mostly converted to stables as the Horthander passion for racing horses grew.</p>
