<p>Bluecap pie was a variety of Duergar pie made using the flesh of bluecap fungi .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , expensive 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms) servings of bluecap pie were sold by Gorstaf , a rude duergar baker from the city of Gracklstugh in the Underdark in northwest Faerûn . Despite bluecap mushrooms being quite mundane, the pies looked lumpy and misshapen, making them appear unappetizing.</p>
