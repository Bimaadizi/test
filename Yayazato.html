<p>The Yayazato clan were a samurai family in Wa and the leaders of Aru Province during the mid-1700s on the Wa Calendar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the removal of Hisao Matsutomo in Wa Year 1730 (1312 DR) , the daimyate of Aru Province passed to Takashi Yayazato.</p>
<p>Takashi governed the province well, but suffered much tragedy. Though he had three sons on becoming daimyo, all strong and suitable heirs, two died when their vessel sank in a typhoon and the third was killed in a climbing accident whilst scaling the Dragon's Face of Mount Matazan . Thus Takashi had no male heirs to succeed him when he died in Wa Year 1758 (1340 DR) . Thus, shogun Matasuuri Nagahide returned the daimyate to the Matsutomos , under Benju Matsutomo .</p>
<p>Takashi's granddaughter, Naomi, later became a favored consort of Benju and was pregnant by him around Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) .</p>
