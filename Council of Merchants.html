<p>The Council of Merchants were the rulers of the Shining Lands .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The eleven wealthiest merchants within the Shining Lands comprised the Council of Merchants. This was determined by simple arithmetic. Those with the most income were awarded seats. Because of this, at least a few council seats changed hands on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>As of 1367 DR , Kara Jeratma was the head of the council; a position her family held since her great-grandfather Jeradeem .</p>
<p>Aside from the main Council, each city within the Shining Lands had their own version of the Council of Merchants consisting of the eleven richest merchants within that particular city.</p>
