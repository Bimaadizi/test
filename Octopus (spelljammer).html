<p>The Octopus was a type of spelljammer originally designed and created during the First Unhuman War by humans and illithids both.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ships moved through space like their namesake cephalopods in the ocean, with their big bulbous ends in front, and their tentacles trailing and pushing behind them for propulsion. Designed as convoy escorts, the layout of their weapons earned them the nickname Tailgunners , although their field of fire was actually 360 degrees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>They were built during the height of the Unhuman Wars by a situational alliance between neutral humans and illithids for escorting neutral convoys. As such, they had many illithid characteristics, yet could be piloted by human mages. Their purpose was to scare away the goblinoid raiders that preyed on spelljammer ships during those great conflicts. To coordinate the fleets of Octopus escorts, the Cuttle Commands were created as mobile command bases. After the end of the Second Unhuman War and the destruction of the goblinoid fleets, the need for large convoys diminished greatly. The human/illithid alliance broke up, and many of the convoy escorts were retired, their equipment scavenged for more maneuverable spelljammers.</p>
