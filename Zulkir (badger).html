<p>Zulkir was an awakened dire badger friend and companion of the High Priest of the Cult of the Dragon Ryngoth circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zulkir was a furry medium-sized animal with a distinctive white stripe from the tip of its elongated nose to the back of its head and white cheeks.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zulkir was a very loyal badger, even though his friend Ryngoth, was a completely evil creature. Zulkir often pretended to be an ordinary animal when other people were around, carefully watching and listening in spying for Ryngoth.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Apart from being as intelligent as any human , Zulkir possessed all the abilities of a dire badger. He could burrow, deal double attacks with his claws, had heightened senses, and was very proficient in stealth.</p>
<p>Similarly to human berserkers , Zulkir was prone to go into a berserk rage when hurt.</p>
<p>Even though Zulkir was intelligent, he was still a beast, making him susceptible to the magic that affected animals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before 1369 DR, Ryngoth befriended the dire badger, after a druid granted him sentience with the awaken spell. Ryngoth named the badger Zulkir, after his own Thayan past.</p>
<p>Zulkir accompanied Ryngoth to Cormanthor , as the High Priest was put in charge of the Cult of the Dragon's operations in the Polyandrium , the dire badger spent his time in the Tower of Bones , in Ryngoth's room. There, Zulkir lounged on a comfy floor cushion, guarding his friend's possessions and pretending to be a simple beast.</p>
