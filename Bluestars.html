<p>Bluestars was a perfume that activated its scent when applied to a humanoids skin.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bluestars was a clear blue liquid with floating golden flecks and a strong medicinal smell. On application to the skin of a humanoid , it changed to a pleasant scent of fresh before-storm winds, and its color turned clear. An exception was its effect on orcs , whereupon it took on the smell of freshly-baked bread . Its application instantly removed all unpleasant bodily aromas and strong smells like curry or garlic , and lasted for about a day.</p>
<p>The high price of 220 gp per pint was not only due to its odor-banishing properties, but the common false belief that it protected the wearer from poisons .</p>
<p>It was rumored that bluestars was concocted out of forest dew that saw starlight, the tears of a virgin, and a distillate of a unicorn 's alicorn . In truth, its recipe included powdered shells of a certain species of snail , a special type of clay , and sap from three common weeds.</p>
