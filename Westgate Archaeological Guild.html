<p>Westgate Archaeological Guild was an archeological organization that operated in the city of Westgate in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Starting with the Year of the Bow, 1354 DR , Westgate Archaeological Guild started petitioning the Council of Westgate for a permit to excavate in the Hills of the Seven Lost Gods , just outside the city walls. The guild re-submitted petitions annually, continuing to do so at least through the end of the 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>To educate the citizens and visitors of Westgate, the guild contracted a public telescope in the city's Market Triangle , affixed aimed at the Seven Hills to the southwest. The lens was activated by depositing five meager gold coins into a slot. By the telescope, the guild installed a plaque that recounted the Hills' history. The information covered the Templeban Edict of the Year of the Red Rain, 927 DR ; the formation of shrines to seven gods on the hills, to Moander , Garagos , Ghaunadaur , Jergal , Savras , Silvanus , and a final long-forgotten deity; as well as the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , when the Hills stopped being used as places of worship and the Templeban Edict was lifted.</p>
<p>Westgate Archaeological Guild's interest in the Hills' excavation was due to their religious use that predated Westgate and dated as far back as the Jhaamdath Empire . The guild sought to uncover historical information hidden deep within the Seven Hills. However, the Council of Westgate declined petitions, citing religious respect for the site.</p>
