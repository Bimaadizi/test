<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , Brinshaar made his way into the Host Tower of the Arcane to steal a magic statuette. However, he was captured and tortured, and he claimed the Host Tower mages tried to use him to get information out about Lord Nasher 's magical defenses. His captors chained him to a wall and instructed owlbears to maim him. The Heroes of Ascore -to-be made their way to the tower, saved him from the pack of owlbears, and Brinshaar offered to join with the heroes, as well as giving them information on the statuettes they most desired.</p>
<p>Once they had made it out of the tower, the heroes were turned on by the seemingly friendly Brinshaar. He controlled a foursome of displacer beasts to try and wrestle back the statuette. However, the traitor was defeated by the heroes, and they kept their hold on the artifact.</p>
