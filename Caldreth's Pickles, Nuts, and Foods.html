<p>Caldreth's Pickles, Nuts, and Foods was a small shop and secret sanctuary for the Harpers in Mornbryn's Shield in the Savage Frontier in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>It sold a variety of comestibles, from staple foodstuffs to snacks, and particularly pickles and nuts .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Its real treasures, however, lay in the basement: a stone-walled chamber that housed shelves of Harper relics and lore. Fine old swords and axes were displayed, as were Harper emblems and books .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1490s DR, the paladin Xenk Yendar led Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Simon Aumar , and Doric through Caldreth's and into the Harper sanctuary, where he told them of the evil of the Red Wizards of Thay and Szass Tam's takeover of Thay and the turning of its populace to undeath . For his assistance in finding the helmet of disjunction to rob the tyrannical Lord Forge Fitzwilliam of Neverwinter and the Red Wizard Sofina , Xenk required that the thieves share any stolen riches with the Neverwintan people, to which Edgin very reluctantly agreed, swearing it on a Harper book at Xenk's request.</p>
