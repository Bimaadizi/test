<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the midâ€“14 th century DR , a daimyo named Hoshi Katahiroi commissioned Chigatta to forge a weapon that could destroy the dragon, spirit and body, that was devastating his province. Chigatta created a katana , more fine than anyone could've imagined, and gave it the name of the dragon it was meant to slay, Celestial Fury .</p>
<p>Hoshi was victorious, slaying the dragon's body and trapping its spirit inside his sword, now a sentient weapons. To celebrate his triumph, and cement the dragon's defeat, Hoshi then asked Chigatta to craft a scabbard from the dragon's hide , ornamented with the dragon's magical pearl .</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the dragon's spirit possessed Hoshi and, under its control, he killed first Chigatta, and then himself. Celestial Fury continued to desire revenge on the descendants of Hoshi Katahiroi and Chigatta.</p>
