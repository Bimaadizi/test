<p>The Echo of the Warblade was a powerful longsword derived from the legendary Warblade , found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Echo was a deadly and fine weapon in its own right, though only a shadow of the true Warblade . It burned with a blue fire, and could create the blade barrier spell for the wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon originated when the Warblade's own nature turned against itself, shedding a small part of its own power as an echo that formed as a lesser blade, also creating the armor of the Warblade . This Echo was potentially found during the reclamation of Myth Drannor, and was willing to be wielded by non-elves. If the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul managed to infuse it with the necromantic energies of the dracolich Karliath , the blade's strength of will could resist the corruption and remain a tool of righteousness.</p>
