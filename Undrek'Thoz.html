<p>Undrek'Thoz was a confederation of drow cities, called segments, beneath Thay . The ten cities that comprised Undrek'Thoz were spread across the middle Earthroot domain of the Underdark , each connected to the others by way of portal . The matron mothers that ruled were kept in check by a monastic order known as the Blackened Fist .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally the far-flung segments of Undrek'Thoz were all independent drow cities, spread throughout the eastern Earthroot. In the Year of the Jagged Leaves, 114 DR , the drow sent representatives from the various segments and concluded that they should band together for mutual protection, which took the form of a web of portals that connected each city.</p>
<p>Over the intervening two hundred years, the cities Mezrylornyl and Sshurlynder also joined the web, further increasing the power of the greater Undrek'Thoz metropolis.</p>
