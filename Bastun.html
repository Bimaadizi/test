<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bastun was taught and inducted into the brotherhood of the vremyonni by Keffrass shortly after being suspected of tempting his sister to enter the Urlingwood , which was a capital offense in Rashemen. Bastun studied under Keffrass, who awakened a love of knowledge in him. He was later suspected in the murder of Keffrass and was given the choice of exile or death; he chose exile and, in doing so, found out who was responsible for his master's death.</p>
