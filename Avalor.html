<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The sagacious elf had one known child, a daughter named Liel , who was a powerful druid and force of nature in her own right.</p>
<p>Avalor served as a member of Queen Anais ' privy council. This appointment was seen as detestable by those in Tethyr that maintained a distinct and vicious hatred for the elven people.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While it was not known for sure, some suspected that Avalor was responsible for the Children's Massacre of Tethyr in the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR . One survivor of the attack , who managed to remained anonymous saw that the killers had the pointed ears of elves.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Avalor heard about a supernatural attack in Cardewton , the colony in Chult in which Liel was staying. Avalor was convinced she was murdered by her husband Declan Cardew . To get some closure, Avalor reached out Liel's former lover Harp Levesque , and the two met at the Broken Axe pub. Avalor hired Harp and his crew to uncover her whereabouts in Chult , or in the worst case scenario, bring back her remains.</p>
