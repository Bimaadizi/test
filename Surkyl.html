<p>Surkyl was a type of elven meat dish found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dish consisted of a porcupine that had its belly slashed open, herbs and leeks inserted into it, and then rolled in clay. Finally, the porcupine would be baked in fire so that its hide and quills would be removed alongside its now hardened shell of mud.</p>
