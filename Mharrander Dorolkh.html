<p>Mharrander Dorolkh , A.K.A. Ander , was a Netherese mage who had become a wraithlike creature by the 3rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the 3rd century DR , Ander was a wraithlike creature made of radiant wisps, with shining emerald eyes. His figure was thin, tall and regal, clad in garments decorated with upswept horns.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Ander kept himself sane by being endlessly curious about the lives of others.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mharrander Dorolkh had displayed a short-range ability to probe the minds of other creatures. He boasted of the ability to take any solid form he chose, as well as selectively solidify whatever parts of his body he preferred. Being smoke-like or perhaps ethereal, he was open about taking no heed of barriers, and about consuming life-force.</p>
<p>One of his spells known permanently transformed the gender of the caster. He worked thoroughly on regenerative magics.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He kept a number of chests, and at least one book with circular pages.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>A recluse even in life, Mharrander kept busy by scrying on people, amusing himself with mimicry, and stealing lore from dying archwizards by being first to get there.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was known to Myrjala , and was eventually introduced to Elminster .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born in −1546 DR in Tzindylspar as one of forty children, Mharrander was sold to the archwizard Kazindrol , to whom he became apprenticed, learning magic in Thyndlamdrivvar . After Kazindrol was slain by his other apprentices, the man stole as much lore as he could, killed the one apprentice that came out of the battle whole, and moved south across the continent, beyond Netheril .</p>
<p>He took to hiding in a mountainous area that was populated by dragons ; there, he employed spells to procure dead bodies from afar, and to scry on fellow Netherese doing research into longevity magics, stealing all he could from those that died unexpectedly, tinkering with regeneration to develop a manner of immortality based on that concept. He found some success, but never was able to get that to work on his own head and brain, and so turned to wraithform and stasis field magics to extend his life while something he could steal was developed somewhere.</p>
<p>Though he endured centuries in this manner, he was eventually forced to look into lichdom.</p>
<p>Around Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , he was introduced to Elmara, actually the shapeshifted prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar . After reading his mind, Ander proffered him a spell that swapped genders for the caster. He also requested that Elminster return ten years later, to read his memories again.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>He could probably take on Khelben or Szass Tam one-on-one.</p>
