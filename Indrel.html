<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late 1357Â DR , Indrel was scrying Shandril Shessair together with a red wizard during her final immolation. Upon witnessing her death, Indrel revealed that portents from Bane , confirmed by the same portents from Shar , were that the coming year, the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR would be a peaceful year, adequate to regroup and rebuild their strength. The red wizard told him afterwards to tell Lord Bane that he was willing to give much himself for power such as spellfire.</p>
