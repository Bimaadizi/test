<p>A werecow was an alleged type of lycanthrope that presumably could take the form of a cow or a cow-like humanoid hybrid. They were alleged to exist by some in the Domains of Dread and the Prime Material world of Toril . Ravenloft's famed monster hunter, Rudolph van Richten , dismissed their existence in his seminal work Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts , stating that werecows were merely figments of imagination born by hallucinations and drunkards.</p>
