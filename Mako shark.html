<p>Mako sharks were a species of seawater sharks that could be found in the Sea of Swords and the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These aquatic predators averaged at 12 feet (3.7 meters), with the smallest being at 9 feet (2.7 meters) and longest reaching 13 feet (4 meters) . Their slick skin was of tan and blue-gray hues.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Makos, like other sharks possessed impressive sensory organs that could detect the scent of blood from as far as 300 feet (91 meters) away, which drives them into a feeding frenzy. Because of that, mako sharks were considered to be ones of the most terrifying predators of the sea thanks to their speed and agility .</p>
<p>The sharks' feeding frenzy often kicked in during an attack once the creature tasted blood. In this case, the ability was similar to the effects of the blood frenzy spell.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Makos, like their cousins, were predators who consumed fish , by the most part, but did not turn down a meal of an animal or a humanoid . Makos possessed low intelligence and often acted unpredictably, often ignoring the prey and attacking savagely one moment later.</p>
<p>Weresharks were known to take shape of makos.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Mako, goblin, and hammerhead sharks lived and hunted in the waters around the Temple-Under-The-Sea , the submerged temple to Umberlee in the Fiddler's Green , one of the underwater region of the Sea of Swords. The Sea of Swords was also home to the giant mako sharks.</p>
<p>In the waters of the Moonsea, a saltwater lake, mako sharks were occasionally fished by the inhabitants of Mulmaster .</p>
