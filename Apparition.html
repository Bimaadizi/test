<p>Apparitions were undead creatures existing mainly on the ethereal plane , who induced heart-stopping terror in their unlucky victims.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Apparitions were the rare result of people who died while in the border ethereal . They looked like skeletal creatures wrapped loosely in cloth bandages.</p>
<p>They had a detect thought ability that allowed them to locate potential victims from 100 feet (30 meters), and across the boundary between the material plane and the ethereal.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Apparitions would dart into the material plane from the ethereal, and attempt to frighten their prey to death. By having the victim experience powerful feelings of cold hands squeezing their throats, they attempted to cause massive heart attacks in those attacked by them. If the victims were not able to distinguish between illusion and reality, they were in real danger of dying. Should they be slain and no attempt was made to raise them within one hour, the body would itself become a new apparition, drifting into the ethereal plane.</p>
<p>When they made their attacks, they had to be on the material plane, and at this time could be attacked by any ordinary weapon. Otherwise, they could only be hurt by weapons that could strike across the planar boundary, or by beings physically on the ethereal plane themselves.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
