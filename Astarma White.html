<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a shipment of Astarma White was brought to the Vast by Fendlara Astarma, on the behest of her father, who hoped she would develop the love for his lifelong passion of winemaking. Astarma vineyards produced good quality reds, whites, and rosés. Astarma White had a notably balanced fruity taste. Fendlara offered Astarma White for a single gold piece per hand-keg – an unbeatable price for such quality. Astarma win was entered into the wine-tasting competition during the year-end celebration of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR in Mossbridges , but it was unknown if it won. Fendlara herself cared little for the competition and was looking to meet up with her adventuring buddies whilst in town.</p>
