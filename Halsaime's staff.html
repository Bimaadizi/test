<p>Halsaime's staff was a magical staff used by the Shadovar in the mid-1480s DR , which came to the possession of the druid Halsaime before being destroyed. Though powerful, the staff had a peculiar influence on the wielder that made it incredibly dangerous.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The staff was made of a dark wood, and one end curled in on itself into a spiral. It radiated a strong red glow when active.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff seemed to provide the bearer with great magical power, but at the same time drove them to great violence and paranoia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The staff was originally held by a Shadovar arcanist that Oriphaun Huntsilver managed to ambush and kill while traveling between Wheloon Prison and the Storm Horns . Oriphaun noted that the staff was extremely powerful and dangerous, and sought to resolve the matter safely. He delivered it to his friend Halsaime, a powerful druid who lived near Eveningstar at Thorngap , a druidic circle that he was the senior druid of.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the staff was too much even for Halsaime. It twisted his mind with paranoia and violence even as it empowered him, sending him on a murderous campaign against the people of Eveningstar. He used it to create red musk zombies and twist nature to his purpose, subverting and maddening his fellow druids, wood woads , and dryads in the process. When he was finally tracked down at Druid's Deep in the King's Forest , Halsaime was killed and the Harper agent Jussko Kwahn used a scroll to destroy the cursed artifact once and for all.</p>
