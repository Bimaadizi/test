<p>A hammer was an implement ranging in size from tiny jewelery hammers to massive warhammers . Certain races preferred to wield hammers, especially dwarves who made extensive use of these tools in mining their great caverns. The light hammer might be thrown at a target and was thus considered a ranged weapon as well as a melee weapon.</p>
