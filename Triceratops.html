<p>A triceratops ( ytepka in the Chultan language ) was a gargantuan, herbivorous, herd dinosaur , also known as three horn by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These massive dinosaurs had a bony plate on their six-foot-long skull for defense, with two long horns on the top and a shorter horn at the nose. Their bodies extended for about 25 feet (7.6 meters), and they weighed around ten tons (nine metric tons). They could travel up to 30 mi (48 km) a day.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Triceratops had especially short tempers for herbivores, and would charge, trample, and skewer any creature invading their territory. When defending their young, they were intelligent enough to form a circle around them, horns facing outwards.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A triceratops could trample creatures smaller than it; it would gore anything else.</p>
<p>As a trained mount the rider would be shielded somewhat by the protective crest of the creature when in combat.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>In Chult , where these dinosaurs were common, there was a secret society, the Triceratops Society , named after them, known for leaving iron triceratops figurines as signs of warning.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , some could be found in the Forbidden Plateau .</p>
