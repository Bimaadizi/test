<p>Semilich was a term used to describe a variety of undead creatures united by a common origin: the failure of an ambitious wizard or cleric in their attempt to become a lich .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A semilich was created when a ritual of lichdom failed, and instead of ascending to the heights of immortal power, the spellcaster was instead relegated to a lesser form of undead. Their fate could be as almost any kind of undead, including as a coffer corpse , juju zombie , ghoul , shadow , or as unimpressive as a regular zombie . Their intelligence was highly variable, ranging from their original faculties to a much reduced state, or even with their soul departed and the body acting mindlessly. Likewise, their ability to cast spells could be present, diminished, or gone.</p>
<p>A particularly notable and powerful form of semilich was that of the boneclaw , which was unique to the failed lichdom process.</p>
