<p>By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Thom Farold was a widower. He honored his late wife by building a large boat that could transport up to seven people. Selara , the boat, was named after her. During the late 13 th century DR, Thom could often be found fishing with his friend, a not-so-humble fisher named Young Ned . In his later years, Thom took on building small boats, with Selara being his biggest project, when he was not over-indulging in ale .</p>
