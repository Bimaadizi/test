<p>Jarm was an evil Netherese arcanist who excelled at spell duels.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This inventor was a methodical and efficient killer; whenever he faced competition, he would make sure that they disappeared. Even mages who were just passing through his hometown of Earsome would find themselves on their deathbed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jarm had many complicated relationships. In spite of his general lean towards evil, he would put himself on the line against the invasion of his hometown by Hidden Forest orcs . One of his nemeses was Shastin , a good priest of Mystryl , but, unlike his other opponents, he didn't have the resolve to face her. Another one of his enemies was the skilled arcanist, Volhm , a creator of powerful evocation spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jarm was born in Earsome in 1841 NY (−2018 DR) . The evil arcanist invented an array of different spells, starting with mount . After defending his home, and taking out his enemies, he sought out Volhm's spell, lightning bolt , and the two engaged in a spell duel to the death in 1898 NY (−1961 DR) . Even though he was facing a senior arcanist who specialized in evocation, the masterful Jarm succeeded, and eliminated Volhm. After his victory, Volhm's chaotic students, in rage, rushed Jarm. Jarm, however, killed each of them, one by one.</p>
<p>Years later, he focused on spell development, and invented magic jar , summon swarm , spectral hand , and irritation . Jarm passed away in 1974 NY (−1885 DR) . Strangely, Jarm was recorded to have invented legend lore in 1985 NY (−1874 DR) , several years after his death.</p>
