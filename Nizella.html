<p>Nizella was the mate of the kobold scribe Azetlin of a tribe from Undermountain that raided streets of Waterdeep midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Nizella's tribe was forced to relocate to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain . There the kobolds settled in the area that later got flooded, making some of them sick. Nizella got "sneeze-sick" and, to her mate's annoyance, full of snot.</p>
