<p>Vicben Arroway was a Cormyrean Purple Dragon who served in the town of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Vicben and another Purple Dragon knight responded to a drow attack on the Midler farmstead to the west of Eveningstar. Both were also captured by Vicala Szind , a priestess of Lolth , and interrogated along with the Midler family for information on the Thread of the Weave that Lolth sought. After Vicben and his comrade failed to return, a second group, this time composed of adventurers, was sent in by Helena Falagon . Upon entering, they found Vicben alive, though in the ensuing fight with Vicala she drained the life force from him to restore her own vitality. With his dying breath, Vicben warned that she could magically sacrifice all ten of the Midler captives or even her own followers to protect herself, forcing the adventurers to avoid battle with Vicala while stealthily freeing the prisoners and eliminating her forces.</p>
