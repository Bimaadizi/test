<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aelorin had nearly white skin and long white-gray hair. He wore a warm blue and white outfit.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Elven Crusade around 1374 DR , Aelorin acted as a liaison of sorts with Eilistraee's Wanderers , who had difficulties with the surfacer elves. In particular, he tried to follow the trail of the various drow who had run into the ruins on their own to find the Key to the Mythal . To do so, he worked with Chessae Baenrahel to find Kelgoth Darksong at the Speculum , Durfryn Alearn to rescue Uhlsdrin Nirveth at Tyrintar's Hall , Greyarra Auvryath to help Zelliira at the House of Song , and finally Izzinid Claddafin to put everything together at Ildrannath's Tower .</p>
