<p>Citadel Yaunoroth was a dwarven city of Ammarindar , built during the Age of Humanity as a stalwart fortress to protect the kingdom from the growing orc hordes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Built into the Greypeak Mountains that overlooked Naurogloth , this ancient dwarfhold extended under the peaks with a network of subterranean tunnels. A single, goblin -made burrow extended from the lower reaches of the tunnels to the Mines of Dekanter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The construction of Yaunoroth was completed in 1 DR , the same year humans of the Dalelands and elves of the Cormanthyr erected the Standing Stone .</p>
<p>When demons from Ascalhorn ravaged the North in 882 DR , they fought the Ammarindar dwarves of Citadel Yaunoroth in a key battle for the kingdom. Queen Helmma and her sister Princess Olmma , led the defense of the fortress and sacrificed themselves in order that many dwarves of her realm could flee south to safety. The spirit of Olmma continued to command the ghosts of the dwarves that perished in defense of the city for centuries later.</p>
