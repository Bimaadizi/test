<p>Angwile the Artificer was a svirfneblin inventor and the foremost authority on beholders , active before the early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Angwile was renowned for his research work despite being often considered foolhardy and reckless. He successfully captured and studied numerous beholders, eventually channeling his work into the creation of many highly sought after artifacts that were always in demand by fellow svirfneblin and other intelligent creatures of the Underdark .</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous items created by Angwile were beholder rings . Each was imbued with magics of one of the creature's eyestalks and improved the wearer's peripheral vision. The true number of such rings crafted by Angwile the Artificer was unknown. However, beholder rings were surely few, as he fell victim to an untimely petrification in the Year of the Broken Spear, 1009 DR .</p>
