<p>A spectral harpist was a type of ghost . They were created when the spirits of Master Harpers died whilst leaving Harper business unfinished.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spectral harpists were intelligent undead that resembled ghosts or wraiths , appearing as translucent, shadowy forms that floated or flew around. They retained the powers they possessed in life as a Master Harper, and could also speak and sing as they did in life, but lost the ability to cast spells and they could not gain new memories.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They were highly resistant to magic as well as to electricity- and cold-based spells , and in certain magicstrong areas (most Harper strongholds and refuges), spectral harpists could not be turned. Once each day, they could sing a haunting dirge known as a deathsong which instilled terror in all living creatures who could hear it.</p>
<p>Spectral harpists innately possessed the ability to make magic items glow with white light.</p>
