<p>Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith the Great Githzerai, who was later often called Menyar-Ag , was an astoundingly powerful githzerai psionicist and the immortal god-king successor of Zerthimon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Menyar-Ag-Gith was a being of "unimaginable arcane and psionic power", and he was able to perform miraculous magical feats. As such, the deity-king was able to transcend the constraints of the mortal coil, and his lifespan was greatly extended. Due to his mastery of the mind, Zaerith remained in a static, unmoving state. In Limbo , he appeared to actually be a demigod .</p>
<p>According to Mordenkainen , it was unknown if the deity-king was alive, dead, or in some other state. However, it was known that he was an extraordinary psion who was worshiped and revered by the githzerai.</p>
<p>Menyar-Ag was known to rule over the most notable cities of Limbo, particularly Shra'kt'lor and the Floating City . The former settlement was his military seat of power, whilst the latter was his seat of religious power.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Zaerith did not require sleep or rest, and could manifest his psionic energy to instantly command his followers, even across the planes. He could produce eruptions of energy in order to transport his followers, and even entire adamantine citadels across the planes, as well. Only Menyar-Ag-Gith could produce such enormous bursts of psionic and arcane energy.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Under the rulership of Zaerith, the githzerai stood fast against the zealous githyanki, and they put many mind flayers to death. The githzerai saw to the needs of their great leader, and he was constantly attended by willing servants.</p>
<p>Menyar-Ag-Gith was foremost in githzerai society, and he commanded both anarchs and zerths alike. Anarchs were chosen by Ag-Gith to command the fortresses of Shra'kt'lor. As such, it became the most well-fortified city in Limbo. Zerths were similar to priests, though they didn't strictly have religion, and instead admired both Zerthimon and Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith. He was known to send his followers across the planes, and even directly to Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aeons ago, the gith as a single race escaped their enslavement from the merciless illithids. The gith leader, known as Gith , was to lead her own people down the same dark, evil , and tyrannical path that the mind flayers walked on. Becoming the thing that the gith hated most struck a chord with a gith known as Zerthimon, and he openly proclaimed the evilness of Gith. A great civil war ensued, Zerthimon sacrificed himself, and his followers were free once more.</p>
<p>During these troubling times, the great Zaerith Menyar-Ag-Gith assumed leadership over the githzerai and led them to the chaotic plane of Limbo. It was here that the githzerai would find order in such a chaotic realm, and it was here that the githzerai would hone their abilities and harness great power. Only by conquering the chaotic tides of Limbo would the githzerai achieve such great feats, and as such, they were relentless in this task.</p>
<p>In these early times, Zaerith was very skilled in both martial combat and magic alike. He later became solely focused on arcane and psionic pursuits, in which his powers grew enormously.</p>
<p>The prolific archmage , Mordenkainen, once visited Limbo, and entered the chamber where Menyar-Ag-Gith resided. The archmage was overwhelmed by extreme psionic activity, which almost made it impossible for him to think. He left with more questions than he had started with.</p>
<p>In the 15 th century DR , Zaerith watched over adventurers as they journeyed around Faerûn. For many years, he had observed them from Limbo, and dispatched one of his masterful kensai monks , Nrakk , to join them. It was unknown why Zaerith sent Nrakk to Toril , but the kensai was always dedicated to the cause of his party.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There were numerous rumors about the githzerai god-king. Some said he had several high mages working on a specific task for him: to be able to instantly summon githyanki into the Floating City. Here, the githzerai citizens would punish their evil enemies. A seemingly ridiculous rumor was that he was actually the offspring of a mind flayer and a human , and this was what made him compassionate. However, this appeared completely untrue, as Zaerith actively plotted against the mind flayers, and was not noted anywhere to look like a ceremorph . Despite particularly wild rumors, the githzerai more than thrived under the rule of their immortal deity-king.</p>
