<p>Awen was a doomguide who lived in Neverwinter as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During an inspection to the Neverdeath Graveyard , circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Awen was ambushed and captured by Red Wizards . She was forced to watch a fellow doomguide by the name of Stonehammer be transformed into an undead creature before she was ultimately slain herself. Awen returned as a ghost but was unable to acknowledge her own death for some time.</p>
<p>At the behest of Doomguide Volahk , an adventurer was sent to cleanse the graveyard and help uncover her whereabouts. The adventurer burned her body to prevent the Red Wizards from using it to carry out a dark ritual, an act that allowed the deceased doomguide to achieve some peace in the afterlife.</p>
