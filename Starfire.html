<p>Starfire , also known as the starfire scepter , was a powerful magical wand of drow design.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wand had the unique ability to destroy incoming magical projectiles, imbue defensive magic upon the wielder's allies, and resist the fiery breath of red dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient history, starfire was used by a drow contingent to overtake the secluded village of Torzac . The leader of the contingent managed to dissipate the magical missiles fired at him by the village mage . After this, the village was promptly razed, and the villagers were slaughtered.</p>
<p>It was at this location that the Darkmoon temple was constructed, but was later destroyed by the inter-house fighting between the dark elves.</p>
<p>Upon the reconstruction of the temple around 1358 DR , Wently Kelso was given a vision of starfire and its use in the conquest of Torzac. He, with much effort, made his way to the village site, but was unable to find the scepter that he believed would be of high scholarly value. His guide, Insal , decided to the infiltrate the evil temple himself to try and get his hands on starfire.</p>
<p>The Heroes of Waterdeep may have acquired the magical scepter, and used it to slay the leader of Darkmoon, Dran Draggore , himself.</p>
