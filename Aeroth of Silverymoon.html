<p>Aeroth of Silverymoon was a War Captain and champion of Silverymoon during the Second Trollwar in the 10 th century DR . Later in life, he relocated his family to the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aeroth was renowned as a champion and hero of the North . By the time he left Silverymoon, he had gray hair.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Famously, Aeroth wielded Taragarth , an enchanted bastard sword that came to be known as "the Bloodbrand" in his hands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the events of the Second Trollwar in the Year of the Rings Royal, 952 DR , Aeroth led an alliance between Silverymoon, Ahghairon of Waterdeep , and Samular Caradoon of Tyr against the trolls , and for this task, he was gifted the mighty sword Taragarth . He fought in the grueling nine-day Long Battle , distinguishing both himself and his sword. That battle ultimately broke the trolls, and the alliance would go on to clear the Evermoors of the foul creatures.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Scythe, 982 DR , Aeroth departed from Silverymoon alongside his wife and six sons following the death of Silverymoon's Warlord Rayuth . Saddened at his lord's passing and distasteful of Rayuth's successor, Tulven , the then-elderly Aeroth traveled to Waterdeep and then boarded a ship heading west. The voyage briefly stopped at Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting , where Aeroth left Taragarth so that his sons would not be able to squabble over it. The family then settled in the Moonshae Isles.</p>
<p>In the Moonshaes, Aeroth founded Vlan , which would eventually grow into a city as other disaffected folk from mainland Faerûn found their way there over the years. Aeroth's descendants would become central players among the feuding merchant houses of the Moonshaes.</p>
