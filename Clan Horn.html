<p>Clan Horn was a wealthy clan of shield dwarves headquartered in the Nether Mountains .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The clan was led by Kira and Zardak Horn .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The primary business of Clan Horn was the leasing of nigh-impregnable vaults to wealthy clients.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Horn Enclave was the legendary stronghold of Clan Horn which, in addition to housing the leaders of the clan, also contained a number of extremely secure vaults. The enclave was home to over a hundred dwarves, of which nearly half were guards.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Clan Horn owned a number of holds and estates across the breadth of the Spine of the World mountains.</p>
<p>One of the great treasures said to be contained in the vaults of Horn Enclave was the wheel of stars , a component of the legendary artifact called the Orrery of the Wanderer . In actuality, this was a ruseâ€” Lottie , creator of the Orrery , spread this rumor to dissuade adventurers from attempting to collect its components.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The holds of Clan Horn occasionally hosted weddings between other dwarven clans, because their highly secure vaults were an ideal place to store lavish wedding gifts. One example of this was the wedding of Gwendolyn Darghun and Tannus Thunderwind (of Clan Darghun and Clan Thunderwind , respectively) in Horn Enclave in the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR .</p>
<p>The archmage Elminster Aumar considered himself a blood brother of Clan Horn (alongside Clans Deepaxe , Gallowglar , Bucklebar , and Worldthrone ).</p>
<p>Clan Horn was a sworn enemy of the adventuring company Acquisitions Incorporated following an incident in which company agents stole several items from the clan, threatened their head wizard , and slept with Rizwin Horn , the clan heiress.</p>
