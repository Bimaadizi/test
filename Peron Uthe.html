<p>Peron Uthe was a famed ranger of Eveningstar and the King's Forest in Cormyr during the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Peron was a renowned and beloved resident of Eveningstar. He lived in the village at Uthe Lodge , and traveled widely about the region, including to the King's Forest. When the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar commenced, he disregarded the drow threat and continued as normal as he roamed and performed his duties.</p>
<p>Around this time, Peron visited the druidic hideaway Thorngap and was infected with a magical disease inflicted by the malevolent druid Halsaime . He returned from the King's Forest to his home Uthe Lodge , then to the Eveningstar War Hospital because he felt unwell. A short while later he transformed into a red musk zombie with large red musk creeper flowers growing from him and began spreading his strange disease to the rest of the hospital, though while others could be turned into red musk zombies, they could not themselves pass on the disease to more victims. In addition to the zombies, primal creatures like mudmen , wisps , and vine horrors began infiltrating the hospital and unnaturally verdant plants began blooming and overgrowing the structure, much like in his home.</p>
<p>When the hospital staff noticed what was happening, they barricaded Peron Uthe into a wing of the hospital and sought reinforcements. The priestess Meena Follakin found adventurers who were able to help, and sent them on to the head priest Hurim Jaskyr who explained the situation. The team rescued and cured as many patients as they could while fighting off the zombies, gathering samples from the fallen Mikhael Jarvin and Aeron Leifbrand as they went. Jaskyr used these samples to create an inoculation against Peron's disease, allowing the heroes to face him directly. Though he had grown into a huge and strong plant-thing, they struck what was left of him down, ending his rampage. Without Peron around the red musk plague in Eveningstar was brought to a halt, though his home had become dominated by the murderous dryad Sylvie and her minions, which was spotted and reported on by Eolynn Arva .</p>
