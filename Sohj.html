<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sohj was part of Aniolon Gruanthe's company that settled in the Raurin , protected by the Evise Jhontil . When the artifact proved to kill wizards that tried to cast spells in its area of effect, Sohj took charge and began looking for a way to stop it. When everything proved fruitless, he decided the city should be moved; when they discovered the barrier preventing egress, he decided to cast a teleportation spell himself, and if successful, he'd return and bring others out the same way.</p>
<p>Rather than allow him egress from the area of effect, however, the Evise Jhontil froze him and continuously shifted him between his target location and his starting location.</p>
