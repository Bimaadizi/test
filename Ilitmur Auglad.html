<p>Ilitmur Auglad was a survivor of Netheril , who was thousands of years old by 290 DR , having gone into a wizard's tower to live in. At some point between 293 DR and 297 DR , he began a romance with the Magister Nasana Melnuthquel after she snuck into his wizard's tower. She lived with him for some years, until someone seeking to challenge her for the position of the Magister broke into his tower and slew him. He was at the time so feeble that he had become a thing of magic more than man.</p>
