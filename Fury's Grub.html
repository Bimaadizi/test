<p>Fury's Grubs were a creature found in the pocket dimension of the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen , which had been carved out of Fury's Heart by the Red Wizard Marek Rymüt .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were fat 6‑foot-long (1.8‑meter) worms with yellow-green blood.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were consumed by Fury's Eels , an aquatic creature found within the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>They were already present within the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen when Marek Rymüt carved the dimension from Fury's Heart. Presumably they were a native fauna of the plane of Fury's Heart, found in other places than only the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen. These grubs were one of the native fauna that Marek didn't destroy when he tamed the pocket dimension.</p>
<p>When Marek Rymüt created his pocket dimension, his main purpose was to replace the nursery underneath the city of Innarlith that he was using to raise black firedrakes . Marek was having trouble finding enough food for them and the firedrakes escaped from that nursery by accident in 1361 DR and wrecked havoc on the city of Innarlith. After Marek carved out the pocket dimension, he teleported his black firedrakes there and let them feed on the native fauna. The worms, which Marek named "Fury's Grubs" turned out to be a favorite food for the firedrakes and they actively hunted them.</p>
