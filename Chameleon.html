<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The elven trickster god Erevan Ilesere went by the title "The Chameleon".</p>
<p>The color-changing power of the chameleon inspired the name of certain magical items, for example, the rings of chameleon power said to be worn by Akim al-Kalaas , leader of the Unclean ; Nabilanasa , a famed elven ranger of the Zakharan desert; and even avatars of the goddess Eilistraee .</p>
<p>Despite the name, chameleon leather , a color-changing armor, was crafted from ophidians , not chameleons.</p>
