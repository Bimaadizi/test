<p>The Omen of Despair was a unique and powerful black unicorn – a creation of Szass Tam 's necromancy rituals, birthed into its unholy form in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Omen of Despair was created to look like a pitch-black unicorn, with its eyes and horn glowing in sinister crimson radiance. Its master, Regent of Thay , Szass Tam, used dark necromantic rituals to give this magical beast the ability to sap all hope and joy from the hearts of living creatures around it. It could produce a dark vortex of energy that pulled creatures around it toward the beast and its deadly horn.</p>
<p>Soon after the Omen of Despair was assigned to serve a group of Thayans, the black unicorn brutally ravaged them, eventually funding an adventurer in Neverwinter and offering them its service instead.</p>
