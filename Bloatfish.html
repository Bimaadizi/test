<p>The bloatfish was a species of fish found in the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bloatfish resembled a white manta ray , featuring an inflated organ that protruded from its belly like a balloon. This organ's diameter matched or slightly exceeded the fish's length.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The bloatfish displayed non-aggressive behavior, swiftly swimming away from any perceived threats.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The balloon organ of the bloatfish remained filled with fresh water due to the fish's distinctive body chemistry. On rare occasions, fortunate fishermen managed to capture a bloatfish. They may choose to keep the frozen carcass with them, allowing them to enjoy sips of the organ's fresh water by puncturing a hole in the fish's side. Once the balloon organ was depleted, the fish could be savored as a satisfying meal.</p>
<p>Bloatfish were scavengers. They consumed plankton, organic waste and any organic material.</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>The bloatfish inhabited the rivers and seas of the Great Glacier . Bloatfish were not territorial and had a natural inclination to form schools of different sizes. Their reproductive strategy involved laying numerous tiny eggs, typically numbering in the thousands.</p>
