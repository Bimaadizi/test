<p>Gothror the Ravager was a great undead skeleton giant in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The unfortunate skeletal creature remained inside Tyrintar's Hall , along with countless other undead. It was encountered when Uhlsdrin Nirveth came looking for the Icon of the Dwarves in 1374 DR . By chance, Gothror had one of the Hall's ward crests stuck between its ribs, which were needed to rescue Uhlsdrin after he accidentally trapped himself in a protected chamber of the building.</p>
