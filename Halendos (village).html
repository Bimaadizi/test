<h2>History</h2>
<p>This village was built on the same site as an old human city, that was burned to the ground during the war between humans and the half-elven descendants of the Yuir .</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , the normally docile fey and wildlife near the village started to act more violent. The fey playing unusually mean-spirited pranks, stealing food, and overall being destructive. A trio of half-elven farmers went on to hire a group of adventurers to investigate this change in behavior, who found it to be a side effect of the Cult of Voldini 's activities.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Those who inhabited Halendos were largely human, though there were some half-elves. All who lived in the village were strongly influenced by the Yuir half-elves and the mystical, fey nature of the area in which they lived. Many had inherent magical abilities or were subjected to prophetic dreams. And a higher proportion of children grew up to be wizards . Overall there was a laid back atmosphere with care for the local environment.</p>
<p>The Simbul was known to visit this village, usually disguised as a farmer or trader, in order to hear of its residents' prophetic dreams and searching for magically talented people to take on as apprentices. One such prophesy was said to have warned her of a Thayan plot against Aglarond.</p>
