<p>Chief Noote was the grand ruler of all the hill giant tribes throughout the Ice Spires in 1366 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Being excluded from a conversation often upset Noote.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chief Noote considered King Camden to be one of his most respected friends. Camden's daughter Brianna considered him to be very kind and a trustworthy ally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1366 DR, Chief Noote developed friendly relations with the royal family of Hartsvale . As a result, the kingdom's long standing feuding with the hill giant tribes of the Spires came to an end. During that year he would make many visits to Castle Hartwick .</p>
<p>Sometime after winter, Noote came to Castle Hartwick on the day of Brianna's birthday and brought within a satchel a present for her in the form of a half-frozen snow leopard that he had killed. He expressed some confusion at King Camden's suggestion that the carcass needed "prepared," but shrugged it off and suggested they don't lose the beast's claws, noting that they could make a good collar for a wolf .</p>
