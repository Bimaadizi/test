<p>Thunderstones were small thrown grenade-like weapons imbued with thunder magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical thunderstone was a fist-sized stone , chiseled to resemble a die with every other side inscribed with magical symbols or runes. During the Spellplague , and until the Second Sundering restored the world's magic, thunderstones were notably, created using clay and filled with powerful alchemical reagents..</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Thrown against hard surface, thunderstone shattered on impact with a roaring thunderclap. The resulting sonic and concussive damage could deafen an unskilled user and the blast's resonation could be felt within the thrower's chest. The deafening effect lasted for fifteen seconds.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Some inventive tinkerers and rogues used thunderstones to create very potent and loud traps that could be heard from half a mile. The trap itself was of simple design -- a pile of magic stones suspended in a net , ready to be dropped once triggered. A typical thunderstone trap could market a high price of 2,730 gold pieces.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1375 DR , thunderstones were used by the Krinth soldiers and Sharran shadow adepts during the return of the Netherese flying city Thultanthar to Toril over the scorching sands of Anauroch .</p>
<p>In the 1370s DR , thunderstones could be found in a rhodochrosite bowl within the House of Pain , a temple to Loviatar in the depths of Undermountain .</p>
