<p>Pinebrook was a small wooded village in the foothills at the base of the Spine of the World mountains in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the silver dragon Hysvearorn laired in a nearby mountain and was furious when one of her wyrmlings went missing. This was due to her egg clutch and newly hatched wyrmling being threatened by egg snatchers trained by ice trolls .</p>
