<p>Tana Farag was a criminal in Heliogabalus as of the mid-14th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The woman was tall and thin, with brown hair, and a sorrowful face.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had the habit of placing a naked dagger ahead of her. She believed in Kosef's cool-headedness over the evidence.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was quite loyal to Kosef Demsk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1360s, Tana Farag called on Pavel Shemov to uncover evidence of Kosef's innocence, after the latter was arrested for the death of Mivar Greyman , a jeweler. On her part, Tana Farag allowed him access to Dor Stavask and Quendar Horn for an interview, and helped him get away from them after he struck a nerve with Quendar. After Pavel reasoned that one of the guards involved in the raid would have a trinket to unmake Kosef's weapon, she helped him tail and discover one of the guards that had been paid greatly recently, Iref Marsk ; she was also instrumental in seizing him, and in the ensuing interrogation, as well as the fight against the barghest that attacked them midway.</p>
<p>She fled once Iref Marsk died, but eagerly broke into Dor Stavask's home later, where she uncovered proof of his involvement in framing Kosef. She was caught after the fight with Dor, where she and Pavel killed the mage, but Pavel managed to cajole the magistrate into letting all of them go.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said her loyalty to Kosef Demsk was because of a great favor or service he had done her before.</p>
