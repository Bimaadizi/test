<p>Cinder shoes were a pair of enchanted boots that allowed the wearer to accumulate heat.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Cinder shoes were a pair of ordinary-looking leather boots covered in numerous scorch marks that, surprisingly, did not damage the leather. This was due to the boots' enchantment that allowed them to absorb mundane and magical fire every time the wearer dealt fire damage to their opponents. This stored heat boosted the wearer's flame damage but, if held for too long, hurt the wearer with the magic fire from the inside.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a pair of cinder shoes belonged to the orog Blurg of the Society of Brilliance , during his stay within a friendly myconid colony of the Ebonlake Grotto in the Underdark .</p>
