<p>Vampire blood or vampiric blood , also known as vampire ichor and referred to among some vampires as kin-nectar , was blood that flowed through the bodies of vampires.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>Vampire blood typically had the same rich, red coloration as the blood of most living creatures. However, when viewed under transmitted light, such as in a vial held under a light, the blood displayed a distinctively golden hue.</p>
<p>Unlike the blood of living creatures, this blood absorbed nothing from the lungs of vampires as they ceased to require oxygen in their undead state. This also meant that any toxic chemicals within inhaled gas wouldn't crossover into the bloodstream. Once blood was extracted from the body of a vampire it could potentially exhibit one of a myriad of different properties. It was considered impossible to predict what property a vampire's blood might have prior to extraction.</p>
<p>Some vampire blood was noted to be highly caustic, some would cause any creature that came into contact with it to fall under the sway of the vampire similar to charm person , and some was noted as violently bursting into flames upon exposure to sunlight .</p>
<p>In the Domains of Dread , it was observed that the moment a vampire was slain any samples of their blood would fall inert. Often times these samples would become corrupted and rancid within mere seconds of the host vampire's death. However, on Toril , this was not the case, as blood could be obtained from slaying vampires without fear of it being rendered inert.</p>
