<h2>History</h2>
<p>The most famous wand of trap detection once belonged to a half-elven wizard - rogue Illep the Watchful from Myth Drannor . He used the wand in his numerous burglaries to see snares and deadly springblades. Illep's illicit career was cut short by an unruly warrior Brammel who was offended by the half-elf's dandified appearance. In ensued tavern brawl, Illep died of an axe wound. Brammel was arrested, and the foppish thieve's belongings, with the wand of trap detection , were sent to his relatives in Myth Drannor . Bandits attacked the caravan that was transporting Illep's belongings, and the wand became lost to history.</p>
<p>The wand resurfaced again in 1281 DR , just outside Kuldahar in Icewind Dale , at a ruined mill in the Kuldahar Pass , ransacked by marauding goblins .</p>
