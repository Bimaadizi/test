<h2>History</h2>

With the Guild of the Just , a party of Tyrrans, he attacked the House of Pain , a temple of Loviatar in Undermountain , in order to free captives, but they were ambushed by the Loviatans. Jhassalan escaped only after the intervention of Muiral the Misshapen .</p>
<p>From that time, he devoted himself fully to Tyr and led the spellcasting forces of the Hall of Justice in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
