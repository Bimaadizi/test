<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Normon was a young man with brown hair, and wore a brown tunic .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Normon was the first son of Ricnan and Jandove , and older brother of Thoben .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , the drow forces of Vicala Szind attacked the farmhouse and captured the entire family alive so that she could interrogate them about the Thread of the Weave . Unknown to the drow, the cook Maisby had escaped back to Eveningstar and sought help, getting first a pair of Purple Dragons and then a team of adventurers to investigate the farmhouse. Unfortunately, Vicala Szind had set all ten Midlers and Chandlers as part of a sacrificial life-draining spell, and the rescuers would have had to stealthily rescue each family member without Vicala noticing, lest she spitefully kill them.</p>
<p>Normon was held captive in the kitchen of the house, alongside his father Ricnan and aunt Quilynn , guarded by several drow invaders who kept them magically paralysed.</p>
