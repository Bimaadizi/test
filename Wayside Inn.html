<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many enterprising innkeepers attempted to run an inn at the intersection of the Triboar Trail and the High Road. Some of them were successful for many years before succumbing to monsters or bandits. Others gave up soon once the dangers became obvious.</p>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , the Wayside Inn was attacked by undead that were created by the cult of Myrkul led by Ularan Mortus . A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.</p>
<p>Later, the cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn occupied the inn. Unknown to the owner Martisha Vinetalker, most of her employees were members of the cult. They impaled the guests as sacrifices to the Stormbringer and tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos. In the process, the cultists summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able to stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists managed to abduct Tarbin Tul , a local bard.</p>
