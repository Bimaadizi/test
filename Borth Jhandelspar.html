<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was cast out of his tribe as a youth and adopted by a Triboar family. There, he later served as a guide to anyone who came to the town seeking his services. He was well known for an inicent in which he traveled from Yartar to Triboar in a blizzard wearing only a loincloth and boots, carrying a sword and singing loudly, to bring the news whilst Triboar was snowed-in.</p>
<p>When Volothamp Geddarm came to Triboar to write a guidebook on the region, and about Borth, Borth was pleased and thought it would bring in business. Borth advised him to cover a well-burning fire with damp turf in order to keep it alight overnight.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Borth was good-humored, but was prone to go berserk in a fight.</p>
