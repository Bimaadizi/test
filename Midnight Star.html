<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Midnight Star was an overpriced, sweet red table wine of decent quality. It had a striking brilliant red color.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Midnight Star wine was brought to the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast . Trendel P. Butterworth , a representative of Sindarian house, entered the wine into a wine-tasting and grading competition. Butterworth's sales pitch claimed that the wine came from a place called "Al'Quidm" and was produced out of grapes gathered only during moonless nights by the city's twenty most beautiful women. Because of that, Trendel sold Midnight Star at a single gold coin per bottle or ten per hand keg.</p>
