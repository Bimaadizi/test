<p>A libram of silver magic was a magical tome of great value to good -aligned wizards .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Librams of silver magic were mystic texts penned in silver ink .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When studied by a wizard of good alignment over a period of several days, it instilled a great deal of experience in their mind, allowing them to become a more powerful spellcaster. The libram would then disappear, and the reader could never again benefit from reading a similar tome.</p>
<p>If a neutral or evil wizard attempted to read the work, they suffered a backlash and fell unconscious for a time as their mind suffered, with evil readers actively forgetting much of what they already knew. They required the casting of atonement , else they would be unable to progress their own skills at all. Non-wizards who tried reading the libram suffered even more, potentially being driven insane and requiring extensive rest, recovery, and magical healing to return to full form.</p>
