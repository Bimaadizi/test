<p>He had the adorable ability of transforming into a house cat .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among his most cherished possessions was his walking stick, a family heirloom that he always carried during his journeys across Icewind Dale. It was in fact a sheathed frostbrand sword, that possessed the power to absorb flame and intense heat, and shoot blasts of cold energy.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Among his goals were to locate sprigs of sacred winter plants that could be used to help feed the people of the Ten Towns.</p>

<p>Belvyre's dearest friend was his long-time bodyguard Patience , a fearsome tiefling warrior who had watched over him since he was a child. He gave her endearing nicknames like "Patty Cake" or "Patootie".</p>
<p>He was also friends with the dragonborn ranger Saarvin , who helped with his experiments by gathering specimens out in the wilderness, and was a contemporary of the wizard Zeddicus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Everlasting Rime struck Icewind Dale in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Belvyre was hired by the council of the Ten Towns to help preserve and regrow the dying plants within their food stores. While Belvyre was working on a solution for the dying plant life, he was introduced by his friend Saarvin to two other companions investigating the Everlasting Rime, the barbarian named Runa and a mysterious warlock called Amos . During their first meeting, Amos suggested they journey to an underground cavern that led to a magical city that was buried deep beneath the Reghed Glacier .</p>
<p>The group set out across Icewind Dale for the glacier, and were eventually forced to take refuge in a cave to keep safe from the elements. Just after settling in they were attacked by frost giant skeletons and were forced to defend themselves. During the battle, Amos turned on the group by abducting Belvyre, stealing his frostbrand , and blasting the others off a cliff. He took Belvyre to an underground cavern full of sacred winter plants, which were nourished by the magic of a primordial shard . After sharing how he planned to exploit Belvyre's talents, Amos took him to the master of the primordial shard army.</p>
<p>As Belvyre's friends delved into the caverns Amos had taken Belvyre, Amos' master decided to use the primordial shard to trigger an underground volcanic eruption to destroy them. As his companions arrive to save him, Belvyre confronted Amos and urged him help save the duergar that would be inadvertently killed by the imminent disaster. He urged his freinds to spare Amos' life and protected him from their vengeance. As lava burst forth from the depths of the cavern, and the ground shook beneath them, Amos gave the frostbrand to Belvyre so he could save himself, their companions, and the unwary duergar. Belvyre managed to save Patience's life for once. Working together, the companions escaped to safety and stood poised ready to uncover the secrets of the long lost magical city.</p>
