<p>The Magelords of Athalantar were a cabal of mages risen to rulership of the kingdom of Athalantar in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Constituted under the authority of Belaur Aumar , the Magelords mostly answered to Ithboltar among their number.</p>
<p>Three among their number also took the title of Mage Royal: Ubriien Orlyn until his death on Eleint 11 of the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR , then Neldryn Hawklyn until his death in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , and finally Undarl until the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Magelords ruled Athalantar by any measure, with their upper echelon being largely left to their own devices, be it teaching, spell research, or hunting. Their apprentices, also magelords in name, acted as their enforcers.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Though many of the Magelords traveled the realm doing the bidding of their leadership, the ones highest among their ranks were known to spend most of their time around Athalgard proper.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, the Magelords were a number of wizards trained by Ithboltar, their eldest, who came at the request of a favored pupil, Neldryn Hawklyn . Initially friends of Prince Belaur Aumar , they took over ruling functions for him after he hired them to seize the throne of Athalantar, a task they completed in the Year of the Dancing Lights, 218 DR . Afterwards, among other activities, the Magelords attacked the Wyrmtower of Shandrath , slaying him in a massed attack in the Year of the Ghosthunt, 222 DR , transformed Prince Nrymm Aumar into an otyugh , battled Felodar Aumar 's own hired mages, and inducted the stranger mage Undarl into their ranks after he slew Prince Elthryn Aumar in the Year of the Flaming Forests, 224 DR .</p>
<p>The organization was forcefully disbanded in 240 DR after the death of King Belaur, as well as just about the entirety of their leadership.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Originally a band of mages from a faraway land, the Magelords eventually came to bolster their numbers by pressing into service every magician passing through Athalantar who didn't do so undetected. A number of them joined in other circumstances, either originally as their foes, or by petitioninh entry, such as Undarl. The total number of magelords, in that way, varied between thirty and forty at all times between 219 DR and 240 DR .</p>
