<p>Corm Orp was a small town in the Western Heartlands on the Dusk Road . In the midâ€“14 th century DR , it was dominated by halflings and led by a human mayor. It was the fastest-growing settlement of halflings north of Luiren .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The halflings of Corm Orp grew a variety of grapes , including a strain known as "blue eyes," to produce sour wines and grape-based dyes for export. They kept goat and sheep in the hills overlooking the settlement, whose hair and wool respectively were occasionally used to make blankets for export.</p>
<p>Beyond farm goods, the people of Corm Orp produced pottery from nearby, rich deposits of clay .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Rumors told that the halflings of Corm Orp could only exist so close to Darkhold as a result of some deals with the Zhentarim . It was said that they received promises of protection for information on rival caravans, adventurers, and whatever else passed through the town's zone of control. But to state such rumors aloud was a good way to anger any halflings living there.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
