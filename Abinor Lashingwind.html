<p>Abinor Lashingwind was the patriarch of a family of storm giants who lived with them in the highest peak of the Gnollwatch Mountains in the midâ€“14th century DR .</p>
<p>He did all he could to keep his family secret from both the human and Crinti who lived in the lands surrounding the mountains in Dambrath . To this end, circa 1372 DR , he created the illusion of a moody silver dragon in the peaks to ward off any explorers or errant monsters.</p>
