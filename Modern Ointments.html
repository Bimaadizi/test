<p>One special item offered by the shop was what the proprietor Jarwahlmin referred to as a "starter kit", selling for 10 gold pieces . These consisted of two cones of strawberry scented incense, a packet of bath salts, foot powder, a small vial of either cologne or perfume, and a small glass pyramid that he claimed would help individuals to focus when meditating. In actuality, these glass pyramids held no such magical effect, but the proprietor was convinced that they did.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 14 th century DR, a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the alchemist Wendell . When they entered Modern Ointments they enquired about obtaining some aroma of dreams and powder of coagulation on his behalf. Jarwahlmin was willing to sell both to the party of adventurers in return for either 950 gold pieces or the pair of diamond earrings that Wendell had given them to barter with. If he was offered the latter, Jarwahlmin tried to convince the adventurers to buy one of his "starter kits," hoping it could lead to them becoming regular customers in the future.</p>
