<h2>Inhabitants</h2>

The tribe also traded in materials gathered, caught, and produced from the Patzcoatl ocean: shells, mussels , dried fish , as well as lamp whale oil .</p>
<p>Kolan tribes of Maztica dwelt in humble villages along the shores of the Western Ocean, sheltered from the Huacli nation by a mountain chain.</p>
