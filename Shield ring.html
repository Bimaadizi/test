<h2>History</h2>
<p>This enchanted jade ring was created by a wizard of some repute known as Bil , who also penned such spells of sardonic nature as Bil's fantastic ale and Bil's blasting ball . The wizard often got into scuffles with other spellcasters and found his simple ring to be very helpful. Sometime around 1261 DR , all records of Bil indicated his disappearance from the Realms, and his shield ring was among items he had left behind. However, most of Bil's friends were individuals of ill repute and likely pwned the ring as soon as they got their hands on it.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR , Bil's shield ring found its way into the lair of yuan-ti marauders in the Dragon's Eye of the Spine of the World .</p>
