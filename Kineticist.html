<p>A kineticist , also known as a telekinetic psion or a savant , was a type of psion who specialized in the psychokinesis discipline of psionics , honing their skills in manipulating and transforming the properties of both matter and energy. They were equivalent to the evokers of arcane magic .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>In some cases, kineticists became overly focused on particular elements of nature and developed themselves further into cryokineticists or pyrokineticists . Other greater paths of psionics frequented by kineticists included that of the elocater , which appealed to their strategic sensibilities.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Kineticists almost exclusively utilized powers that fell within the purview of the psychokinesis discipline. Their specialization in this discipline allowed kineticists to unlock a suite of powers that were unknown to other psions. These powers were as followed â€“ control air , control body , control object , dispelling buffer , energy ball , energy cone , energy current , energy missile , fiery discorporation , inertial barrier , null psionics field , psionic telekinetic sphere , reddopsi , and tornado blast .</p>
<p>In the years following the Spellplague , almost all telekinetic psions exhibited the powers far hand and forceful push .</p>
<p>Being specialists in psychokinetics, the arsenal of kineticist typically included the power to fling objects around or bind them in place, create defensive barriers, and fire destructive blasts of energy. Some kineticists were also known to create astral constructs , which were uniquely wreathed in the type of energy their conjurer preferred, such as acid or fire .</p>
<p>Beyond psionic powers, kineticists were skilled in the art of autohypnosis .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While traditionally psionics users such as telekinetic psions didn't need any physical tools or weaponry to practice their discipline, following the Spellplague they began using implements to enhance their abilities. Typically these took the form of orbs and staves , through which they would channel their psionic energy into powers.</p>
