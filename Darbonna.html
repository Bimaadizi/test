<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Darbonna was stationed just outside one of the gates between the Lower City of Baldur's Gate and its more affluent Upper City . Her and other fellow Fists' job was stopping rabble from entering the Upper City, allowing only those with much coin through. The Fists managed a slow-moving queue of rich and poor – city folk trying to return home or just find safety behind the second set of walls.</p>
