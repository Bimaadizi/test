<p>The Citadel was a fortress and prison in the city of Arabel in Cormyr . It was the largest building in that city and the home of the Army of the East .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The grand fortress was so large that it was visible from no matter where one stood in the city. It was designed primarily to be a fortress, and so it did not have many distinguishing features that did not serve it in that role.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Citadel was located in the most prosperous section of the city, the north, near the Arabellan Palace and just west of the Lady's House , a temple to Tymora . It was surrounded by multiple mansions of the rich nobles and merchants of the city.</p>
<p>The highest lookout tower on the city walls—where Kelemvor once battled Knightsbridge —was just north of the complex.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Adventuring charters, which were a requirement for adventurers operating in Cormyr, could be acquired at the Citadel.</p>
<p>In addition to a jail, the Citadel also contained a royal library, where historical records of Cormyr were kept.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Aris , Galaeron Nihmedu , and Ruha were once held prisoner overnight in the Citadel's jail for their own protection from the Shadovar .</p>
