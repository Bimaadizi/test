<p>Kindling, the Twin Flames of the City were a pair of matching magical elven scimitars found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The two adamantine scimitars were infused with great and powerful fiery magic that burned away everything they struck. When matched together, the blades grew even more deadly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The blades were created during the Weeping War , first used in the defense of the city right before the situation became hopeless. They eventually reappeared in a Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins, since taken over by a Red Wizards strike force that enslaved the dracolich Karliath . The blades may have then been taken by the Cormanthor Elves when they removed the threat.</p>
