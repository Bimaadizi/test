<h2>History</h2>
<p>Along with the rest of her family, Jeryth moved from Cormyr to the city of Waterdeep in 1350 DR , though they still retained their title. In Waterdeep, the family settled down in a mansion called Phaulkonmere .</p>
<p>By 1367 DR , Jeryth was believed missing or killed near Luskan as a result of the same caravan raid that took the life of her mother. This massacre was performed by the Hoar Fang tribe of gnolls due to the schemes of a doppelganger member of the Unseen seeking to gain information about the noble family.</p>
<p>The truth was however that as of 1370 DR , Jeryth lived within and roamed the High Forest as a ranger, tasked with the mission of serving as Mielikki's foremost defender of the woods. Jeryth's interference in troubles of the forest was however rarely necessary as the native elves often were capable enough to handle such matters on their own.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Jeryth was known to have spent time in Everlund in the company of her fellow faithful of Mielikki, Tathshandra Tyrar of Silverymoon . The encounter with the Chosen of Mielikki left Tyrar feeling lighthearted, bolstered in her faith, and as though young again. Tyrar felt that Lady Phaulkon's relationship with Mielikki was comparable to Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon's relationship with the goddess Mystra .</p>
<p>Not long thereafter, it was rumoured that Lady Alustriel sought out an alliance with Lady Phaulkon to address expansionist actions of Turlang the Treant .</p>
<p>As of 1492 DR , Lady Phaulkon's powers had grown so great that she had ascended to the status of a demipower , having shed her physical form to become a disembodied voice and presence within the villa gardens of her family home, Phaulkonmere . In this state, Jeryth served as a leader of the Emerald Enclave , offering magical aid to any of its members.</p>
