<p>Grimskalle was a frost giant fortress located on the isle of Solstice in the Sea of Moving Ice in the Far North . It was later claimed by the goddess Auril , as her personal domain when she resided on Toril during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located dead center on the isle of Solstice, set between gardens of ice sculptures that were formed by the Frostmaiden's ice magic.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Grimskalle resembled an imposing skull, adorned with a horned crown. The entirety of its structure was formed of carved ice that emanated a mist of icy air, standing 600 ft (180 m) tall from base to peak.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Grimskalle had three levels, along with a rooftop that was well-fortified by battlements. From bottom to top, Grimskalle comprised a snowflake-shaped dungeon, an entranceway set at ground level, and a palace chamber situated above.</p>
<p>Grimskalle's stellate dungeon held a large, ice-covered central chamber, from which extended six hallways. The north-facing hall held the tombs of Vassavicken's frost giant subjects, some of whom had been risen as skeletal undead . The giant queen herself was interred within a tomb of ice, set beneath the likeness of the titan Thrym .</p>
<p>The four side halls were inscribed with scenes that depicted frigid scenes of nature, each leading to a chamber that teleported an individual to one of the "tests of the Frostmaiden" found throughout Icewind Dale . In order to open the southern path, to the Hall of the Four Winds and the fortress' vault, one had to pass the tests of cruelty, endurance, isolation, and preservation.</p>
<p>The Hall of the Four Winds held four tablets inscribed with the dogma of the Aurilian faithful, each of which was bound to a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Air . Just beyond were two smaller rooms, one of which housed the Codicil of White , and another that bestowed the blessing of the Frostmaiden .</p>
<p>The entrance to the fortress was inscribed with runes in Dethek , that directly translated to the word "Grimskalle". Beyond the entryway was a guard room, the keep's kitchens, and a great feasting hall.</p>
<p>Within the top level of Grimskalle was a throne room, once used by Vassavicken and later by Auril, along with the private chambers befitting a queen.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Due to its giant origins, the interior layout and furniture set within the build were built to enormous scale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The imposing fortress was originally built for the frost giant queen Vassavicken .</p>
<p>Auril the Frostmaiden hid herself away within Grimskalle while her form appeared on Toril during the Everlasting Rime , circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR , Grimskalle became connected to the appearance of Auril in Faerûn . If her form on the Prime Material plane was destroyed, the fortress was believed to collapse in on itself.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the time of Auril taking up residence within Grimskalle, only one elderly frost giant named Ertgard remained within. He dedicated himself to the Aurilian faith.</p>
<p>Auril's roc companion Iskra nested atop the roof of Grimskalle, just as a number of ice mephits sat along the walls like gargoyles , and the particularly intelligent giant walrus called Ukuma dwelled within its dungeon.</p>
