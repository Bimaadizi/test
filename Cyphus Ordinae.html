<p>Cyphus Ordinae was a monk of the pacifist Guarded Mind Order in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cyphus Ordinae zealously followed the strict laws of his monastic order. He appeared to be fully human at first glance, but his half-elven nature became apparent upon close examination. Cyphus had a careworn face of a person who suffered hardships throughout his life. Despite it, he was a friendly man who smiled when meeting strangers and meditated when faced with hardships or danger.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the City of Splendors became once again endangered by the drow menace from the Undermountain . The Masked Lords determined that the danger was coming from Undermountain , and Durnan , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal , put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the mega-dungeon and route the evil within.</p>
<p>Cyphus recorded the deaths of several prominent Waterdhavians at the hands of drow assassins and was sent to the Yawning Portal by his order as an observer to witness the descent into the drow den. The Guarded Mind Order was interested in documenting the drow, studying their tactics, and recording information about the dreaded Underdark . Being a pacifist order of scribes, Cyphus Ordinae refused to participate in the expedition nor participated in the battle that raged when the drow from Undermountain broke into Durnan's establishment and slaughtered some of the adventurers gathered there.</p>
