<p>Nyressa Flass was a vampire and the Zulkir of Necromancy of the Red Wizards or Thay as of the 12 th century DR . She was famously known as the Vampire Zulkir .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nyressa was a member of the noble Flass family of Thay and served as the Zulkir of Necromancy prior to the Year of the Wizened Mage, 1157 DR . That year, Szass Tam led a group of Red Wizards to slay her. Per Red Wizard custom, a Zulkir could only be removed from office if there remained no possibility for their resurrection or return as an undead being, thus Nyressa had to be completely destroyed with an oaken stake through the heart and a liberal application of fireballs . Szass Tam then assumed her position as Zulkir of Necromancy.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the story of her demise remained one of the best known examples used by the Red Wizards to explain the need to utterly destroy a Zulkir before they could be replaced.</p>
