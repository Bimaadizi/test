<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Odezzt had messy white hair and white facial tattoos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Odezzt worked at the Temple of Mystra in the King's Forest searching for the Thread of the Weave , accompanied by Eldrin Szind and Phargred Avithoul . Odezzt oversaw the many human prisoners captured from Eveningstar , using drow slave collars to put them to work as laborers and disposable bodyguards for the drow as they ransacked the ruined temple. When Ana Brabener , Torin Betrich , and Cormul Haythorne came searching for the Thread themselves, Ana was captured, collared, and interrogated by Odezzt. Though she knew nothing, Odezzt discerned a strange magic about her, and his interrogations were only interrupted when a team of adventurers sent by Cormul arrived to rescue her. Despite having Ana and more enslaved villagers at his disposal, Odezzt was slain and his victims saved.</p>
