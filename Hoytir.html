<p>Hoytir was a young stablehand who worked for the noble House Pharaboldi until his death in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hoytir was a good man by all accounts. Despite what his murderers claimed, Hoytir was not courting Jithelle Skolotti , a maid from the same noble house who was killed alongside him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Tarsakh 10 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Hoytir and Jithelle were murdered at an alley in Arrabar by Captain Dressus and men dressed as the Municipal Guard of Arrabar . The killers drew three blue circles on the young people's foreheads, framing them to have claimed to be wizards – a crime punishable by death. Their murder was ordered by a sneak coin cabal between Pharaboldi, Matrell , Talricci , and the corrupt Grand Trabbar Lavant of the Church of Waukeen . The young woman bedded Denrick Pharaboldi , a scion of a merchant who had his eyes on marriage to a daughter of house Matrell. A bastard child was an inconvenience. Jithelle and Hoytir were reported to be a couple, and their bodies were cremated to stop the real Guard of Arrabar from magically interrogating the victims as per the procedure.</p>
<p>Justice was brought to Hoytir's name by Vambran Matrell who successfully investigated the murder he accidentally witnessed.</p>
