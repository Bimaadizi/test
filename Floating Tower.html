<p>The Floating Tower was the tower of the lich Ondil of Thaeravel . It came apart completely between the 3 rd and 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower was at the western end of the Watchers of the North , north of Secomber .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>By the 3 rd century DR , the tower had already gained the name of the Floating Tower, because the spells that kept it up had failed for the base, leaving the tower to effectively start at its sixth floor. By the 14 th century DR, there were only a few twinkling motes of magic left.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior floors of the tower were luxurious, with numerous amenities like a red velvet carpet in one room, which had its walls curtained with gems threaded into fine wire; a different room held white marble statues of winged women. Some of the statues softly whispered ancient poetry with a sighing voice, which was somehow understandable to the Brave Blades adventuring party in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<p>One room in particular was apparently a bottomless pit, with a number of balconies on its walls; the structure was too large to fit within the tower, strongly suggesting an extradimensional space. All balconies led to Ondil's tomb, even the one from which the room was accessed. Ondil's tomb proper had a stone casket, a wooden coffin inside, and ornate wrought iron windows with stained glass scenes of flying dragons, pegasi, and wizards standing on crags. Those had hinges that allowed them to be moved, revealing solid bubble glass windows behind.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Spells prevented mold, decay, and kept the place dry and at a comfortable temperature.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The valley was prowled by griffons liveried with Ondil's symbol, and the decay of the tower's lower levels effectively acted as a nearly impassable obstacle. There were a number of further defenses inside the tower beyond the room of speaking statues, including some manner of motes of light that chased metal in one room, and a room leading to Ondil's tomb, with hovering spheres that held a red dragon , an illithid , and a beholder , each trapped and likely in stasis within their own sphere. A fourth floating sphere had Ondil's Book of Spells and two dreads inside with it.</p>
<p>Upon reaching that room, the path backwards became warped so that instead of leading back the way one came, it led into Ondil's tomb again. The passageway to Ondil's tomb had an enchanted door, from which Ondil could hurl spells; the archway leading back into the balconies had the same power. The actual tomb's windows were guarded by a spell that thrust anyone out through them if they damaged the glass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ondil moved to the general area after the fall of Rasilith to the forces of Netheril .</p>
<p>In 232 DR , before being joined by the Mystran priestess Elmara (secretly Prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar ), the Brave Blades adventurers learned of the location of Ondil's Tower from an old account by a merchant who stumbled upon its valley.</p>
<p>They explored the tower in 233 DR , but became trapped in Ondil's Tomb upon retrieving Ondil's Book of Spells . None of them survived the exploration except for Elmara and Tarthe Maermir ; they were attacked by Undarl right after they disabled Ondil, who had slain the others with deadly magic. Only Elmara survived Undarl's attack.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that Ondil was powerful enough to hide from all Netherese mages, and that the tower had been raised before Netheril even rose to power.</p>
