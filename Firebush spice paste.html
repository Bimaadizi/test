<p>Firebush spice paste was a condiment made from the fireberries , a species of spicy greenish peppers that grew on a bush with distinctly red leaves in the Battle of Bones of the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were two notable recipes for firebush spice paste. The first version called for frying up chopped onions and garlic in oil with a small handful of fireberries added in later. Once the peppers darkened in the pan, a love-apple was diced in and the concoction was sprinkled with salt , sugar , and molasses . The paste then was slowly cooked until oil began to pool on top. This paste then was jarred and kept for a couple of month or much longer if kept refrigerated. The spice was potent and a pinch was enough to flavor a big bowl of soup, stew, or rice .</p>
<p>The second version called for soy sauce exported out of Shou Lung . This recipe required no cooking and as such, it was quite popular. The mix was comprised of four ounces of soy or sho-yu , crushed garlic, a couple of crushed firebush berries, a teaspoon of molasses. When combined, it was left to marinate for at least half an hour. Unlike the cooked version, the condiment lasted indefinitely once jarred and the spice levels increased with the sauce's age.</p>
