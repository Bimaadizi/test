<h2>History</h2>
<p>The deep gnomes inhabiting Aventine, and much of the city, was destroyed by drow aided by crinti and arkaiun . Though the drow and crinti did not suffer many casualties during the attack, the arkaiun, or shebali, were nearly wiped out.</p>
<p>Queen Melanith 's consort, Sadalar , was killed during the conflict. For their support, the drow awarded the crinti with prime drow males with whom to breed. Melanith selected a new consort from this bunch.</p>
