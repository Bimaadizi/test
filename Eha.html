<p>Eha was the Maztican goddess of wind and air.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Eha appeared as an ever-changing being of white smoke, sometimes in the form of a slender woman that almost seems solid, but always insubstantial and her exact shape tended to change quickly.</p>
<h2>Worship</h2>
<p>Eha was regarded as a beneficent deity by the Mazticans, and was believed to give breath to newborn babies. Like the other goddesses, no humans were sacrificed to her. Instead, the parents of infant children would place small offerings of food outside on a windy night in thanks.</p>
