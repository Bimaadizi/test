<p>Celestial was the language of celestials . It used the Celestial alphabet .</p>
<p>It was brought to Toril through contact with good folk from other planes . It was described as beautiful, yet alien in nature, since it developed among beings with thought patterns very unlike those of humanity . Clerics often took the time to learn it, and the Celestial alphabet was used to transcribe the Mulhorandi language , except in Thay , where they wrote their own dialect of Mulhorandi using the Infernal alphabet instead.</p>
