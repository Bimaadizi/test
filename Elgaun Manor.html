<p>Elgaun Manor was a grand estate in Tegal's Mark that served as the summer home to a wealthy Sembian family from Yhaunn .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The facade of the manor was heavily windowed and its amenities included an indoor pool.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>While the family from Sembia occupied the house during the summer, it was tended to in winter months by a local Tassadran couple.</p>
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>The family from Sembia often used the manor to host parties for their southern neighbors, hiring mages to delight the guests with illusions , as well as minstrels and bards to entertain with music. Their celebrations could last for days and involved pranks, accidents, and occasionally murder.</p>
<p>On one occasion, two rival mages flew around Tegal's Hill throwing fireballs at one another. This incident garnered the attention of the Grand Mairshar , who asked that she be given a warning before the next soir√©e, for fear of terrifying the townsfolk of the Mark.</p>
