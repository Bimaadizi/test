<p>Dangwaru (Typhoon Palace) was a palace built on the Snout of Omgar by the tortles to make the crew of a wrecked ship feel at home in the late 14 th century DR . By the late 15 th century DR, the palace was dilapidated and haunted. Young tortles went to the palace to find treasure but were quickly scared away.</p>
<p>The captain of the ship was a human female whom the tortles admired. She worshiped Umberlee and told the tortles stories of sea monsters that she'd fought. She supposedly died about fifty years after her arrival but was in fact transformed into a carrion crawler by Umberlee for an unknown slight.</p>
