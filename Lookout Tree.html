<p>The Lookout Tree was an elven tree in the Dalelands in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a shadowtop tree, with a near-endless spiral staircase. Up top, the leaves were large enough to act as cushions; for those who were guests of such elves as Starsunder , the leaves would mold themselves into chairs if needed.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Those who did not walk up the stairs would startle the tree on contact, and it would defend itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , during the Chaos of the Art , a mage from Galadorna , Umbregard , visited Tangletrees looking for answers regarding Elminster Aumar , one of the Chosen of Mystra . He was met by Starsunder, who brought him to the Lookout Tree to converse.</p>
