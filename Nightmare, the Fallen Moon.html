<p>Nightmare, the Fallen Moon was a powerful elven moonblade bastard sword uncovered in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Nightmare was a gruesomely deadly blade, even beyond its supernatural keenness. It held entropic energy that unmade reality, vampirically drained the vitality from victims, and mentally attacked them with waking nightmares in the manner of mind thrust and phantasmal killer . If that wasn't enough, the sword's powers could be further augmented in combination with a planar focus of erudition , planar focus of prowess , or planar focus of subterfuge recovered from Lolth's realm.</p>
<p>The blade possessed a malevolent will of its own , and Nightmare willingly served any who were strong enough to claim it, if only for a time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nightmare was once a traditional elven moonblade , passed down in the family to be wielded by the virtuous. The blade was somehow lost and corrupted with fell magic, becoming a thing of malice and destruction. During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Elminster directed heroes from Eberron to invade Lolth 's realm and foil her plans with Ana Brabener and the Demon Weave , protecting their home and Faerûn in the process. Nightmare may have ended up in their hands at the end of the adventure.</p>
