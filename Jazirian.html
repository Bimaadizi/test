<p>Jazirian was the couatl deity of community, peace, learning, and parenthood.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>Jazirian's symbol was a couatl with its tail in its mouth.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jazirian manifested as a vast, rainbow-colored couatl simultaneously winding through the air and forming a circle with his/her tail in his/her mouth. Couatls saw Jazirian as being both hermaphroditic and sexless at once.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jazirian was a wise, intelligent, and contemplative being.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Couatls believed Jazirian was a perfected manifestation of the World Serpent archetype; other serpent gods, such as Io , Merrshaulk , and Shekinester were less perfect or immature manifestations of the same greater concept. Certain obscure texts considered Asmodeus to be a variation on the theme, even naming Asmodeus as Jazirian's twin.</p>
<p>Jazirian was said to have fathered the naga deity Parrafaire , whose mother was Shekinester.</p>
<p>Jazirian was also an ally of the god of the jungle dwarves , Thard Harr .</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Jazirian's realm, known as Uroboros , the Gates of Wisdom, could be found in Solania , the fourth of the Seven Heavens . Uroboros was an invisible, intangible realm in the clouds above the layer; it could be reached only by making a leap of faith off the peak of a mountain, or by flying upward until one could fly no more and plummeted toward the earth. The seeker discovered a realm of lightness, exhaustion, relief, and utter bliss. Feathers floated through the realm, as did ghostly serpents , couatls, and wind walkers . Words became flesh in this realm. Jazirian permitted evil creatures to enter, although they had to undergo tests and be given a chance to repent.</p>
<p>The Ruby Palace of Sardior was said to appear here periodically on its journeys through the planes.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Jazirian was revered by couatls. He/she had no clerics or shamans.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to a scholar named "Chrystos", the multiverse was originally nothing but swirling Chaos. Gods slowly formed in the primal confusion, and among them formed the greatest of Law's champions, the Twin Serpents Jazirian and Ahriman. In the beginning they were intimately intertwined with one another, Jazirian's tail in Ahriman's mouth and vice versa. Together they established the fundamental principles of the planes: the Unity of Rings, the Rule of Threes, and the Center of All, creating the ring-shape of the cosmos , the triads that dominated it, and the plane of neutrality called the Concordant Opposition or the Outlands.</p>
<p>Ahriman and Jazirian, who originally worked together in all things, warred over which plane would be the center of everything. Ahriman chose Baator and Jazirian chose Heaven. They struggled so greatly that, with their tails still in one another's mouths, they forcibly tore apart. The blood from Jazirian's damaged tail formed the first couatls, while the blood of Ahriman, whose terrible fall created a vast pit called the Serpent's Trench, formed the first pit fiends . Ahriman, wounded and imprisoned by the laws he himself created, went by the guise of the archfiend Asmodeus, while Jazirian remained quietly in the background, using her couatls to gather intelligence on Ahriman's goals.</p>
<p>The truth, however, was far less grand: Jazirian was but one of the many facets of the sarrukh deity the World Serpent that became a full and individual deity when the World Serpent fragmented.</p>
<p>Some time after the fragmenting of the World Serpent, Jazirian and their fellow once-facet Ssharstrune both courted the naga goddess Shekinester. Ultimately, Shekinester chose Jazirian and became pregant with Parrafaire by them.</p>
<p>During the wandering of Okoth , a group of sarrukh prayed to Jazirian for aid and it responded by turning them into couatls. A bitter war ensued between the couatls and the remaining, more evilly inclined sarrukh, but the couatls held their own until another once-facet Merrshaulk apparently slew Jazirian. At that point, the couatls fled to Maztica on Toril , where the deity Qotal embraced them and they in turn thought he was Jazirian reborn.</p>
