<p>Krystryn's Shelves was the shop, and home, of one of Sundabar 's master carpenters, Krystyn Danard . She specialized in crafting shelves, chests and wardrobes with a smooth finish and considered her work an art, demanding complete privacy. Some of her rival wood-workers insisted that magic played a part in her creations.</p>
