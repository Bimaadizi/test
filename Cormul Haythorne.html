<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cormul was a diminutive hin man with long light brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the middle of the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Cormul Haythorne joined his friends Ana Brabener and Torin Betrich in the search for the "Thread of the Weave", the mysterious war goal of the drow war. Torin insisted on taking action to save the village, and so the trio went into the King's Forest , presuming that the old abandoned Temple of Mystra would have something to do with what the drow wanted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the drow were already there performing the same search, and attempted to abduct the three friends, only for Ana to produce a magical blast. Cormul and Torin were forgotten as the surviving drow abducted her, disappearing into the temple. While Torin stayed to search the area, Cormul returned to Eveningstar and sought help from the overwhelmed Purple Dragons Constal Adamor Thellik , who delegated the rescue mission to a group of Eberronian heroes who were passing by. He was quite delighted when Ana was returned intact in the end.</p>
