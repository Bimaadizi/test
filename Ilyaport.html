<p>Ilyaport was a port town and later fishing village in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood on the shore of the Shining Sea , southwest of Ithmong in Ithmong Bay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilyaport was founded sometime around 100 DR , based around a temple to Umberlee known as the Shell House , home to the Green Priests Umberlant order. The settlement flourished, becoming quite a grand town.</p>
<p>However, during the Rage of Wizards in the Year of the Sword's Oath, 1142 DR , when rival wizards and yuan-ti engaged in wildly destructive spell -battles up and down the Tashtan Coast , the Shell House was destroyed. Many of the Green Priests died in the collapse, but before it did, the temple was struck by a huge scouring wave that carried away the Umberlant holy relic known as The Orglara . The Umberlants believed this to be "by Arm of the Goddess", that is, sent by the Sea Queen to steal that which she desired.</p>
<p>Without the temple, Ilyaport's prosperity ebbed in the shadow of the city of Ithmong. It was just a simple fishing village by the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Government & Religion</h2>
<p>The civic deity of Ilyaport was Umberlee, the Sea Queen. Even after the fall of her temple, the town was ruled by the highest-ranked Umberlant priest who dwelled there on a permanent basis. Circa 1373 DR , this was Dread Wavelord Dumai Arachneie .</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR, Ilyaport was a small town home to 1,923 people.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>This small town was most commonly visited by adventurers hoping to find the treasures whispered to still lie unrecovered in the ruins of the Shell House.</p>
<p>The pirates Captain Raurivyl Ornshield and first mate Dreak of the Scimitar of Fire may have had a safehouse hideout in Ilyaport around 1370 DR .</p>
