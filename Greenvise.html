<p>Greenvises , also known as greenvise vines , were a semi-intelligent and ambulatory species of carnivorous plants that could be found in parts of the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These plants were visually similar to a venus flytrap , but far larger and sturdier. They had thick, green, trunk-like stems and four sturdy vine-like tendrils. In addition to these tendrils, greenvises had tendril-like roots that they used to move around. When their jaws were closed they resembled a mundane leafy bush, but once opened they revealed their interior to be a mottled pink and lined with tooth-like thorns.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Greenvises had an innate ability to sense any object or creature within 60 feet (18 meters) that was in contact with vegetation. Additionally, at a rate of twice per day, if extremely hungry or injured greenvises would release a deathly acidic fog out to 60 ft (18 m) that was so dense it severely limited the vision of other creatures.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Greenvises were largely an opportunistic, ambush predators, due in part to their slow rate of movement. Whenever they recognized that prey was sparse in a particular area, a greenvise would proceed to reposition themselves throughout the day. They fought by using their tendrils to ensnare and pull prey towards the vise-like grip of their maw to swallow them whole.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These plants were generally only active during daylight hours, entering a state of rest during the night.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Greenvises typically grew around hills, plains, or marshes in areas that had temperate to warm climates.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some fey were known to cultivate greenvises and it was not uncommon for stirges to lair near them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR , swamp striders were counted among the many creatures that one could potentially encounter on a rare occasion while traversing the sewers of Waterdeep .</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague , the inhabitants of the city of New Sharandar grew greenvise vines on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis.</p>
