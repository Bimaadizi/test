<h3>Notable Locations</h3>
<p>Two particularly long stalagmites had their points chiseled away and were crowned with a lintel stone. Chiseled into this stone were the words "DON THE CRYSTAL CROWN" in Dwarvish . These elder runes could be activated by the crystal crown of King Melair I .</p>
<h3>Exits</h3>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As the name suggested, troglodytes were the predominant species living within the Warrens.</p>
<p>While the primary denizens were the tribes of namesake troglodytes that skulked its caverns, the Warrens were home to a number of other deep-dwelling creatures such as stirges , fire beetles , piercers , and clans of trolls. One such clan wandered too close to the Forest of Stone; this left them horribly mutated, disfigured, and, in the case of one troll , magically transformed into a svirfneblin .</p>
<p>One stretch of the Warrens contained the lair of a monstrous behir that had been inscribed with arcane markings by the Mad Mage himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the 15 th century, the Warrens were a battleground between the drow of House Auvryndar , who attempted to establish a permanent stronghold in the neighboring Muiral's Gauntlet, and those from House Freth who lived within Spiderwatch Keep in the Maze Level just below. During these years they shackled and enslaved many of the troglodytes, using them as thralls in their ever-growing feud.</p>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kol'daan emerged as a leader among the troglodytes of the Warrens. He bravely guarded his kind from the pervasive threat of drow enslavement.</p>
