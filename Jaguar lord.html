<p>Jaguar lords were large, intelligent jaguars that lived in the jungles of Maztica .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jaguar Lords looked like large jaguars , with the normal golden fur and black rosette spots of that feline. They were also highly intelligent and capable of speech.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Jaguar Lords were normally solitary, although some would assume leadership of a tabaxi tribe. They worshiped deities from the Maztican pantheon , mainly Nula , Zaltec , and Azul . Jaguar Lords were cunning, often using trickery and deception to defeat opponents; however, many were also hishnashapers and some were priests.</p>
<p>Jaguar Lords were always male, and had to mate with a female tabaxi in order to produce offspring, which were always Jaguar Lords. They were among the most dangerous creatures in the Maztican jungles. Jaguar Lords disliked couatls , and would attack one on sight.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a wild halfling tribe would choose a Jaguar Lord as its talisman.</p>
