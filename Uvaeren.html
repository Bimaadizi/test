<p>Uvaeren was an ancient elven realm built during The Founding Time in the forest of Arcorar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Uvaeren was built in a forest clearing in what would later become Mistledale , due southwest of Oakengrove Abbey .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Like the other realms of Arcorar, Uvaeren was ruled by a Coronal. In Uvaeren, the Coronal was an elected official, though once elected, they ruled for life.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Third Crown War , nine clans of elves (five sun elf , and four moon elf ), all of whom were enemies of House Vyshaan , fled Aryvandaar in an effort to create a new, more peaceful elven realm. Initially, they settled the lands on the western shore of Lake Miir , and named their new realm Ilodhar . Ilodhar suffered centuries of attacks from goblins , ogres , and orcs , and in -8210 DR , all except three of the sun elf clans decided to abandon Ilodhar and try to settle somewhere else. One of the sun elf clans and two of the moon elf clans joined the elves of Rystall Woods , where they founded the city of Yrlaancel in -8130 DR , while the remaining sun elf clan and two moon elf clans settled southwest of Jhyrennstar to found Uvaeren. The Rivleam clan were chosen to lead the people living there.</p>
<p>Uvaeren became famous for its libraries and other collections of mundane and magical lore, developing several innovative methods to store knowledge, including, as many elves believe, the first tel'kiira .</p>
<p>Coronal Kiyuigh , Uvaeren's third Coronal, was more of a warrior than a scholar, and after his predecessor died while hunting in -7400 DR , Kiyuigh began leading sorties into the mountains to slay orcs and giants living there. He managed to lead one hundred such attacks until he was overcome and killed in -6900 DR . Eltaor , the next Coronal, returned Uvaeren to a land of scholarship. After Eltaor was killed by a palimpsest in -6300 DR , a young elf named Intevar was elected Coronal. Intevar was credited as having managed to store the collective knowledge of the elves in his personal library, unfortunately, this attracted the greedy, and Intevar was killed defending his library from seekers of the secrets of high magic in -5660 DR . Uvaeren's last Coronal was Intevar's young wife and apprentice, Lady Mnuvae .</p>
<p>Over three millennia after its founding, on Midsummer of -5000 DR , a meteor hit Uvaeren, obliterating it and killing a full three quarters of its citizens, including Coronal Mnuvae and almost the entirety of the city's nobility.</p>
<p>Uvaeren was never rebuilt and its survivors migrated to Jhyrennstar and Semberholme . Its remaining ruins would, millennia later in -1950 DR , house a horde of drow who had invaded western Cormanthyr and would be the site of Coronal Sakrattars Irithyl 's death. Over two hundred years later in -1720 DR , some Netherese wizards took refuge in those same ruins, but all were dead by -1718 DR after setting off the magical defenses of one of Uvaeren's hidden libraries. On Nightal 30 of 0 DR , humans were escorted through the ruins of Uvaeren to witness the quamaniith high magic ritual that would raise the Standing Stone and seal the Dales Compact .</p>
<p>At some point, the dragon Dretchroyaster managed to acquire the Diamond Staff of Chomylla , an Uvaeranni artifact which was key to opening one of the library-vaults there. After discovering the staff's purpose, the dragon planned to use it as a focus to absorb all of the magic remaining in Uvaeren and turn himself into a being capable of challenging the gods themselves . Circa 1480 DR , the noted Turmishan sage Imani sponsored several groups of heroes to recover the staff , but although successful, it was stolen from him by an orc gang known as the Fangfists , this led to a four-way chase involving the Cult of the Dragon ; a band of Zhentarim mercenaries; an agent of the Shadovar ; and Imani's hired adventurers. Imani's employees won out in the end and the staff was returned to him with the knowledge contained within its keyed vault intact.</p>
