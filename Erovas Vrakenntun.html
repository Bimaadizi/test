<p>When Auvrarn Labraster , disguised as Blandras Nuin, was finally confronted by Anastra Syluné Silverhand one night in 1369 DR , she made such a ruckus that it was perceptible throughout the neighborhood. One of the people tormented by the noise was Erovas Vrakenntun, who stared out the window for much of the evening. After discovering the ghost of Syluné, his wife bit her knuckles, whether in jealousy or terror, which startled him; he decided they were going to be moving, probably to Port Llast .</p>
