Ravel reported that information to Matron Mother Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin, who assigned him to lead an expedition of House Xorlarrin troops to Gauntlgrym to scout it out and determine whether it would be a suitable place for House Xorlarrin to build their own city. The force consisted of 100 drow, including 19 spellspinners, with 200 goblins , and a score of driders . The expedition successfully occupied Gauntlgrym and retook the Forge.</p>
