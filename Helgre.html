<p>Helgre served as the first mate on the Orcsblood , a pirate ship that terrorized the Moonsea in the mid–15th century DR .</p>
<p>She managed to escape when the Orcsblood was attacked and destroyed by devas in 1460 DR .</p>
<p>Helgre correctly reasoned that two shipmates, Gareth Jadaren and Ivor Beguine , who had recently jumped ship, were the ones responsible for betraying the Orcsblood' s location to the devas. She dedicated the following months to tracking down Gareth and Ivor and found them near Erlkazar in 1461 DR . Rather than attempt to kill the two men, she slew Ivor's lover, Jandi M'baren , and staged the crime so that it appeared Gareth was responsible.</p>
<p>At some point after 1461 DR , Helgre became a vampire . She participated in the assault on Jadaren Hold in 1600 DR but was killed by the deva Lakini .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
