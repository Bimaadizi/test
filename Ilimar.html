<p>Ilimar was a long-ruined sarrukh city from the time of the empires of Isstosseffifil and Mhairshaulk .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The ruins of Ilimar were magically split by a portal in the center into two sections, each located in a different part of Faer√ªn . The northern ruins were found in the western Gulthmere Forest between the Vilhon Reach and Dragon Coast , close to the southern shore of the Lake of the Long Arm . The southern section was located in the foothills north of Rethild , on the eastern slopes of Muaroghal , the mountains in eastern Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was overgrown and ruined.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The northern section of the ruins was haunted by giant spiders and controlled by lamia nobles , who were descendants of the infamous lamia ruler of Westgate , Nessmara .</p>
<p>The southern ruined city was fearfully guarded by a group of spirit nagas that sensed a great power beneath the surface and believed it to be the sarrukh, emerging from their ancient tombs. They bided their time, gathering information and waiting for when the primeval race would lead their kind and kin out from the Great Swamp of Rethild to battle and glory. The lizardfolk of the Great Swamp worshiped these nagas as gods and considered the ruins a holy site.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was originally constructed by the sarrukh, one of the creator races , by a minor clan responsible for providing slaves to the empires of Isstosseffifil and Mhairshaulk.</p>
<p>Buried within the southern ruins of Ilimar were three sarrukh who had been hibernating since before the drow conquered Dambrath . These sleeping sarrukh were venerated as gods by the spirit nagas, who anxiously awaited the awaking.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bright Star, 1231 DR , an adventuring band called the Talons of Timindar unexpectedly discovered Yornar's Trail Companion , a moon-shaped spellbook sacred to Mielikki , within the ruins of Ilimar, after battling the nagas , lamia , and spiders. Oddly, they found it hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room that was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a fireball spell.</p>
