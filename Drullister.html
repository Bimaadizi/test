<p>Drullister was a phaerimm and the leader of a small hive in Synod in 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Drullister and its hive gathered in Synod to study the strange sharn formed from Augathra the Mad , a fellow phaerimm, and Shar Cormrael .</p>
<p>After 1372 DR , Hadrhune discovered the location and the very strange mythallar located there. Unknown to anyone, Hadrhune decided to make a deal with Drullister instead of fighting and agreed to teach it shadow magic in exchange for free access to study the mythallar. In 1375 , however, an adventuring party raided the ruins in order to disrupt the shadovar 's plots.</p>
