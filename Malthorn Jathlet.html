<p>Malthorn Jathlet was a member of the Jathlet merchant family of Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . Not much was known about this mysterious mage, but rumors about the Jathlets spoke of kidnapping important individuals and permanently altering their physical appearance so they could be turned into slaves without anyone being the wiser. If the rumors were true, Malthorn's skill in necromancy was a likely source for this kind of manipulation of faces and body parts.</p>
