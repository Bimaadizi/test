<p>Harel was a human boy working as a stablehand and messenger in the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a quiet and softly spoken lad.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Aged 13 as of Eleint in 1368 DR, he had tawny-brown hair and a lopsided smile with missing front teeth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Harel and another boy, Tymos , were slaves to the merchant and slaver Mather Ukkhemn . In Flamerule of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Mather dared to stay at the Yawning Portal with the boys in tow, thus angering its proprietor, Durnan , who'd reputedly been a slave himself once and despised the practice. Although Mather promised the boys were working for him of their own free will, their fear and their scars were apparent to Durnan and other patrons. Durnan had Mather removed from Waterdeep and gave the boys new jobs as stablehands. Over the next two months, the boys proved themselves to be capable messengers and errand boys on the behalf of the inn's guests as well.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Harel was quite devoted to Durnan, for rescuing them, and to Tymos, his friend and fellow former slave. He would not doubt anything they told him or asked him to do. However, this loyalty could get him into a little trouble, as it meant he ended up innocently covering for Tymos's stealing. Gradually, Harel began to grow curious about his friend's nightly adventures. Durnan, too, was suspicious of their activities, but did not confront them, instead waiting for one or the other to own up or slip up.</p>
