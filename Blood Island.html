<p>Blood Island was a small island that sat in the River Mirar in the city of Luskan . It was fortified to house the standing army responsible for defending the city. This fortress briefly came to be known as the Dragon's Lair during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island was dominated by a guard tower, two barracks, and an armory. There was little else of interest on the island.</p>
<p>The interior of the fortress was decorated with tapestries depicting coastlines and ships as well as furniture of black oak . The windows in the officers' quarters commanded an excellent view of the coast.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Blood Island sat further upstream than the other islands in the River Mirar's mouth (namely Closeguard Island , Cutlass Island , Fang Island , and Harbor Arm Island ). It lay in the middle of Luskan's Harbor Cross bridge: it was connected to Luskan's South Bank by the Short Span of the bridge and to the North Bank via the Long Span .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The barracks contained layers of fortifications, with three separate sets of staggered walls designed to trap attackers and many murder holes designed to then kill them.</p>
<p>Catapults mounted on the roof of the island's guard tower were capable of bombarding enemy ships in either of Luskan's harbors as well as those coming from upriver. They could also fire into the city itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Blood Island was occupied by Luskan's standing army through the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bent Blade, 1376 DR , forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood . They seized Blood Island for their assault across the Harbor Cross, and the city guard remained hunkered within their garrison as they fretted over which side to join.</p>
<p>With the descent of Luskan into anarchy following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Blood Island was abandoned: the barracks fell into ruin and its windows were boarded up, and the island became cut off from the city as the Harbor Cross fell into disrepair (although the bridge was rebuilt and known as the " Blood Bridge " in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR ).</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the island had become the headquarters of a Shou crime syndicate known as the Dragonbloods , and the refurbished garrison came to be called the "Dragon's Lair". This gang trafficked in all manner of illegal goods—including drugs and slaves —and were known to be violent, hence the name "Blood Island" came to be seen as all too appropriate. The gang's leadership was killed by Kalen Dren , Myrin Darkdance , Rhett Hawkwinter , and Sithe during the outbreak of the Fury plague in the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR .</p>
<p>By 1489 DR , the guard tower and barracks once again housed Luskan's soldiers. Access to the island was restricted to members of Luskan's Ships or to those otherwise approved by the High Captains of Luskan .</p>
