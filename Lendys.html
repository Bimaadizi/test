<p>Lendys ( pronounced : /ˈ l ɛ n d ɪ s / LEN-dis ) was the lawful neutral dragon god of justice and the judge of dragons in life instead of after death. He was the consort of Tamara , and was commonly worshiped alongside her and Bahamut , who in some traditions was considered to be their son.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his natural form, Lendys was a huge, wingless platinum dragon with tarnished scales, and his eyes gleamed with brilliant beams of light so no one could hide from his gaze. Some say that he cared more about judging others than himself.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Lendys had a lair in the plane of Nirvana .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Lendys was worshiped mostly by lawful dragons, but they usually tried to balance his implacability with mercy of their own.</p>
<h3>Clergy</h3>
<p>Lendys's clergy served as judges among dragonkind. In some cases, towns even asked a cleric of Lendys to parse out justice.</p>
<h2>Temples</h2>
<p>There were few temples to the dragon god of Justice. Most dragons often had small shrines to him in their lairs. Other races had a small shrine engraved with his holy symbol set up in a courtroom or courthouse.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Lendys was justice personified. As such, he represented the principle that every action had a reaction and that everything had to be balanced at the end. It was Lendys who ensured that those who did evil acts were rewarded with evil, that those who did good received good, and those who lived by the sword died by the sword. He had no mercy in his soul, nor forgiveness, and gave no second chances.</p>
<p>As arbiter of dragonkind, Lendys served as judge, jury, and executioner. When a dragon committed an injustice against all dragons, Lendys or one of his great wyrm followers went to dispatch appropriate justice. Punishments were severe and no one heard of anyone appealing to his mercy.</p>
<p>Some of his dragon adepts followed the Ptarian Code , a draconic code of honor created by the gold dragon Ptaris in the ancient past. Originally intended as a guide to conduct for the lords who attended the King of Justice , the Ptarian Code eventually was adopted by many gold and silver dragons.</p>
<p>The Ptarian Code was similar to the codes of chivalry adopted by knightly orders of humanity. It included paying homage to Lendys, as well to the draconic deities Bahamut and Tamara. The major precepts were:</p>
<h2>Rites</h2>
<p>Any trial for justice counted as a rite to Lendys. The duty of finding the truth in a trial was taken seriously by his clergy. Although the god often focused his judgement exclusively on dragons, other races who worshiped him usually generalized any act of justice as an honor.</p>
