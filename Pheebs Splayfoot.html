<p>Pheebs Splayfoot was a hin businessman from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pheebs was a pudgy halfling man with pale skin, blue eyes, and curly black hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the Absolute crisis , certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was saltpeter . Pheebs Splayfoot sought to purchase a shipment of barreled saltpeter from the dwarvish trader Djingo and participated in a bidding war against Kaet Ling and Smiley Gheef . Djingo charged at least 500 gold pieces per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double the amount to the Gate's steel watcher foundry. Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding war ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes. Despite the loss, Gheef was hopeful for future transactions.</p>
