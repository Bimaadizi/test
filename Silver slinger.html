<p>The Silver slinger was a holy repeating heavy crossbow found in Eberron during the mid-1480s DR off Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The crossbow was carved in the form of a beaked, horned beast, with wings outstretched serving as the prods and bolts shooting from its mouth.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The crossbow was filled with holy and good energy, making it exceptional at smiting evil . It was even more deadly against the undead , and each bolt shot from it was magically enhanced as if they were made of silver , better harming monsters like lycanthropes and vampires , and further altered so that they struck with crushing rather than piercing force, letting them shatter skeletons easily.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The crossbow was created for the Templars of the Silver Flame , who desired a tool for smiting the undead. The crossbow was later awarded to adventurers in Stormreach , who helped the paladin Felnis investigate the Lords of Dust when they opened a passage to Khyber and the Spinner's Prison , ultimately leading them to Faerûn.</p>
