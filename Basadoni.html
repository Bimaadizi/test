<p>Pasha Basadoni was the leader of House Basadoni , one of the more powerful thieves' guilds in Calimport in Calimshan in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Basadoni accepted the young Artemis Entreri as a member of his guild, though he later entered the service of Pasha Pook .</p>
<p>When Enteri returned to Calimport in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Pasha Basadoni invited him to join again, but Entreri refused. Soon after, some high-ranking members of House Basadoni tried to kill Entreri to maintain the guild's prestige, but Entreri killed them all—at the price of involving Jarlaxle and Bregan D'aerthe . At last Entreri and the drow assaulted Basadoni's palace and confronted the pasha. Basadoni acknowledged the power of the drow and offered instead an alliance with them with himself as figurehead leader and Jarlaxle commanding from shadows. Entreri seemingly accepted the pact but then killed Basadoni in cold blood, claiming the leadership of House Basadoni for himself.</p>
