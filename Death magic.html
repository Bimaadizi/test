<p>Death magic was an effect that guaranteed death, usually immediately, though it was possible to resist it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>Main Forms</h3>
<p>Death magic came in many forms, the most common of which were spells , such as finger of death , and supernatural creature abilities, such as a beholder 's death ray. However, there were other forms of death magic, some embodied in magic items, some involving transportation to other planes, or otherwise. Most of these effects could specifically cause instant-death to an inhabitant if they failed to resist it. Death magic was not dependent on the amount of damage a spell or effect could deal. As such, a highly powerful fireball was not a form a death magic, even though it could kill most beings outright.</p>
<h3>Other Forms</h3>
<p>Almost all death magic caused instantaneous death. However, some forms, such as the effect of breath of death spell, instead instantly infected a being with a fatal disease . The infected beings were unable to heal naturally or via magical curing , meaning they would certainly die, unless they somehow found a way around it.</p>
<p>Another form of death magic was noted to exist in Constabulary Branch One of Karsus Enclave in Netheril . A net of interwoven spells within this maze-like building could cause a refraction effect, causing the being to instantly undergo reincarnation .</p>
<p>When travelling to the Ethereal plane , i.e., via blink or ethereal jaunt , it was possible to reappear inside of a solid object. Failing to resist this form of death magic would cause instant death, though managing to resist it would cause the affected being to plummet into the Deep Ethereal.</p>
<h2>Notable Death Magic Spells</h2>
<p>There were several spells that utilized death magic, such as finger of death , wail of the banshee , implosion , death spell , power word, kill , and black blade of disaster . Some of these spells drew magic from either the Negative (or positive ) energy plane in order to harm good (or evil ) creatures. Spells that involved death magic could be resisted by the death ward spell, as long as it was cast on the target beforehand.</p>
