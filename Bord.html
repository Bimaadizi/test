<p>Bord was the son of Storric , the miller in the village of Tweyar in Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bord was of medium height and overweight. His shoulders were especially broad, and his legs especially short and thin. He wore a beard on his wide jaw and had straight, brown hair. He dressed in a brown shirt and tan leggings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the spring of the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , when Star Protective Services offered its training to the village of Tweyar, Bord was among the initial trainees. However, the burly youth was offended when Zaranda tried to teach them, believing that women were not fit to fight, because he considered them weak. Zaranda soundly demonstrated to him that strength was far less important in combat than skill and intelligence, knocking him down with her saber still in its scabbard while he fought with a quarterstaff . Embarrassed, Bord retreated from the training field.</p>
<p>Bord ended up sticking with the training, however, and became a member of the Tweyar Self-Defense Force .</p>
