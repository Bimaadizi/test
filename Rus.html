<p>The Rus were an Illuskan tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many centuries before the 14 th century DR, the Rus raided much of coastal Faerûn , with some bands even sailing the rivers further inland.</p>
<p>In Year of the Bloody Goad, −105 DR , a group of Rus led by chieftain Yvengi were transported onto the eastern shore of Lake Ashane in Raumathar by way of a malfunctioning portal in the Whalebones . The Rus integrated with the native Rashemi of the region, and their presence was credited with sparking the insurrection that would displace Eltab in Year of Leather Shields, −75 DR , led by the half-Rus and half-Rashemi warrior hero also named Yvengi .</p>
