<p>Thasselen was a city located just south of the country of Aglarond during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thasselen was a walled city with a main keep. The city was encircled by a number of small fortresses.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city lay on the coast of the Wizards' Reach on the Sea of Fallen Stars south of the Yuirwood . It lay about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Bezantur .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The city specialized in farming, fishing, and a small amount of caravan trade, such as with Bezantur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thasselen was initially founded by the empire of Unther following the great wars between Narfell and Raumathar , but over the passage of time Unther lacked the strength to hold it and Thasselen was controlled by Thay for centuries before eventually gaining independence.</p>
<p>Thasselen was destroyed in the Salamander War due to a plot hatched by Hargid Tenslayer and his allies in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR .</p>
<p>The burned-out remains of the city were given to Aznar Thrul after the death of Hargid Tenslayer, and was folded into the newly created Tharch of the Priador . Thrul treated Thasselen and its surviving citizens as his own personal possessions. The people were frequently terrorized or killed both by random monsters wandering in through the broken walls as well as by Thrul's gnoll garrison, who captured and tortured them in the central keep. Slavers and Red Wizards in need of test subjects were also given free access to the city. Attempting to leave the ruined city was considered a serious crime, and efforts to smuggle out important citizens or children were met with brutal punishment, including the use of the flensing spell.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the city's population had been reduced to half of what it had been prior to the Salamander War just a decade prior. After Bezantur was badly damaged following the eruption of the Ship of the Gods volcano in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Thasselen came to be considered a major Thayan port on the Sea of Fallen Stars. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it was regarded as a major settlement but remained quite poor.</p>
