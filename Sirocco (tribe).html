<p>The Sirocco was a tribe of aarakocra based in Anauroch in north Faerûn . Sirocco aarakocra were more slender and ferocious than other aarakocra.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>A shaman held a position of importance within the Sirocco tribe. The shamans passed on secrets to their successors.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sirocco tribe ate meat that they hunted and scavenged for. They did not eat creatures with intelligence, but did eat animals from caravans that passed through Anauroch.</p>
<p>The Sirocco tribe had an elaborate funerary ritual. When one of them died, the body was flown to the Mesa of the Fallen , a part of their territory that only their shaman was allowed to visit. The shaman performed a secret rite involving chanting, drumming , and placing feathers of family members onto the dead body. Then the shaman took the body into the Cave of Beyond in the Mesa of the Fallen. Unknown to the aarakocra, the cave was a portal to some other place, activated by the final part of the funeral rite. When the body disappeared from it, it was actually being taken elsewhere. The aarakocra believed that the spirit of the deceased was taken to a place called the land of Open Sky .</p>
<p>Thus, they carried a superstition associating caves with the dead.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Sirocco aarakocra's territory encompassed a number of mesas, on which they lived. One mesa in particular was the Mesa of the Fallen, which was on the edge of their territory. Only the shaman of the tribe visited the Mesa of the Fallen. Inside was the Cave of Beyond, a portal to elsewhere.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shaman of the Sirocco tribe was captured by stingers circa 1372 DR . The aaracokra were unable to pursue the stingers because of their fear of death as without their shaman they would not be able to conduct the secret funerary ritual. The son of the shaman was chosen by the chief, after a series of long councils. His task was to find people from outside the tribe that could save their shaman for them. His delegation visited Silverymoon , and attempted to make an agreement with Alustriel Silverhand .</p>
