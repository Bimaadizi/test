<p>Thorm's Mill was the only one of its kind in the city of Ashabenford , a bustling gristmill that processed wheat, oat and other grains from all around the Dalelands . Due to the fact the River Ashaba became very shallow near Elven Crossing further downstream, the mill's owner Thorm Ubler was able to maintain a monopoly on milling within Mistledale . Thorm was known as a miserly man, and used his position to heavily overcharge the dalesfolk.</p>
<p>There were a number of attempts to build a rival mill on the river near the Yeven Trail , each of which have ended with fire or bandit raids.</p>
