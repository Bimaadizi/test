<h2>Description</h2>
<p>King Osaw appeared to be a Tabaxi man of 80 years of age, with hunched shoulders and wrinkled skin, though he was over a millennium-and-a-half old. Despite his age and appearance, he had a youthful energy and a deep, questioning gaze. He bore a platinum circlet and platinum armbands as symbols of his kingship.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Osaw was soft-spoken but noble.</p>

<p>In addition, Osaw had been granted the special power to recall with crisp precision every event and meeting he had experienced within the entire long length of his reign.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Osaw's son, Kwalu , was negusti of Chult and also was another of the barae .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>King Osaw ruled from a triangular throne room within the Temple of Ubtao . He spent about eight hours a day there, holding court.</p>
<p>Osaw was also the author of a work of history, The Eternal Life of Mezro .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>King Osaw became a bara and the ruler of Mezro some fifteen hundred years before 1372 DR . He was 85-years-old when he was chosen, which was why he appeared elderly even as a bara .</p>
<p>For a third of his reign, Osaw kept the city of Mezro hidden by powerful magics, so that only native Tabaxi could even see the city, let alone enter it. After a successful war against the goblin Batiri tribes, however, King Osaw chose, in 1363 DR , to once again open the city to outsiders. This decision resulted in a large amount of trade goods flowing through the city.</p>
