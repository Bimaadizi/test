<p>Rods of terror were enchanted rods that emitted the aura of evil, fear, and unease.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rods were palpably evil even when inactive. When they were activated, rods of terror projected forward a wave of unspeakable terror on a target. This foul magic was able to affect even the most brave and unshakable heroes with the feeling of gravely dread. A fully-functional rod held fifty charges and allowed the wielder to cast fear (three charges per use) and scare (a single charge) spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , these rods could be found throughout the Sword Coast region, notably in the cities of Neverwinter and Daggerford 's Sorceller's Encapsulate .</p>
