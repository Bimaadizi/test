<p>The offices of the Middle Magistrate were the base of operations of the Middle Magistrate of Bral .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The complex was located on Trader's Way in Middle City , on the leading starboard side of Bral's Great Market , about a half block away and around the corner from the curios shop of Gamalon Idogyr , the famous Tethyrian mage .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The complex consisted of several connected buildings: a courtroom, a jail with six cells, a barracks for the Magistrate's Watch, and offices. The architecture here was far less fancy than that of the High Magistrate's .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Watch of the Middle City were far more active than those of the High City and included about 20 guardsmen and several mages . Guardsmen were well-equipped and trained fighters , wearing chainmail and carrying longswords and crossbows . They patrolled in groups of four to a dozen, though only occasionally, unless they were summoned to apprehend a particularly dangerous criminal.</p>
