<p>Utrumm's Music Conservatory was a school of music in Silverymoon , with a superb reputation in the North . It was a member institution of the Conclave of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The original site of this conservatory was in the Northbank of Silverymoon, near Hunter's Gate . Around 1372 DR , it was moved to a new location in Southbank , overlooking the river , to be a part of the campus of the Conclave.</p>
<p>Some later scholars placed Utrumm's original location at the site of the famous bard 's college of Fochlucan before its move to Southbank, but this was probably based on a cartographer's error.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was large, though rather plain looking.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Utrumm's Conservatory contained over 40 magically sound-shielded practice rooms, so that musicians and singers could practice without disturbing others. Every such practice chamber had observation balconies so that the Masters of Music or students could listen in if desired.</p>
<p>On the ground floor, there were two Halls of Hearing, which were auditoriums for recitals. In addition, the building held a vast archive of written music and "song scrolls".</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>For one silver piece , anyone (student or otherwise) could rent one of the practice chambers for two hours at a time. Part of the agreement, however, was that students and faculty could listen in from the balconies. One could also purchase music lessons, but these had very stiff fees.</p>
<p>A musician could use one of the recital halls for free performances, but they were forbidden to charge an admission fee for such events.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The founder, Utrumm, had died by 1372 DR, but the faculty maintained the good reputation of the school.</p>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR, the conservatory owned the original piece of magical sheet music for the Song of Breaking , penned by a love-stricken young composer from Silverymoon. It was believed that anyone who heard the composition suffered the same grim fate as the composer himself. Eventually, the music left the Conservatory and ended up in a private collection in Daggerford .</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim , leaders of the Blood of Morueme , sent a half- blue dragon hobgoblin bardess named Lothouryte to Silverymoon as an ambassador to the Silver Marches . Lothouryte wanted to join the faculty at the Conservatory to teach courses on dragonsong .</p>
