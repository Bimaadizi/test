<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the final days of Nightal in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Shantar along with a dozen or so other aerial riders volunteered to serve as scouts for Khelben Arunsun when the threat of the phaerimm arose in lands near Evereska . Using invisibility magic, Shantar his hippogriff mount monitored the activities of the phaerimm and their army of bugbears , mind flayers and other horrific beasts.</p>
<p>As battle broke out at the edge of the moor between the monstrous army and elven warriors from Evermeet send to aid Evereska. Shantar led the scouts on an aerial support mission, transporting Naneatha Suaril and her Selûnite clerics atop their flying mounts to support the elves' rear guard. The maneuver was a successful one and granted the elven soldiers some reprieve, until a miscalculation by Evermeet's commander Laerm Ryence caused the elves to be overtaken by the mind flayers and a fearsome phaerimm. He called for Khelben's help in his mind, alerting the chosen of Mystra to the turning tide on the battlefield.</p>
