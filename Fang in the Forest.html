<p>The Fang in the Forest , formerly known as Daerlo's Rest , was a conical-shaped peak and the southernmost of the Earthfast Mountains . It was thought to have been an extinct volcano and was said to be partially hollow.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The peak was best known as the lair of the ancient green dragon Aglaraerose . Deep inside the mountain was her lair, which she named the Lure of Jaws .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The peak was originally known as "Daerlo's Rest" after a local forester who was gored by a boar and laid to rest on the mountainside.</p>
<p>In the later 14th century DR, Aglaraerose built a lair in the mountain and was still believed to inhabit the peak in the late 15th century DR, although she was never seen.</p>
