<p>Around 755 DR , the Iron Fox evicted the Chauntean priest Rarendon from the Shrine of the Sheaf near Buckralam's Starn, and announced to the villagers by evening at the Trough and Plough they were to have their services to Chauntea in the fields. He wrote a code of laws by noon the next day, nailing it to the establishment's door.</p>
