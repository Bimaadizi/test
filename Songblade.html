<p>A songblade was an enchanted sword that could serve the role of a musical instrument when wielded in battle by a bard .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the term "songblade" was sometimes used in places like Neverwinter to refer to a bard who specialized in swordfighting, often with a flamboyant or swashbuckling flair.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While generally rapiers , songblades could be any kind of light or heavy blade. Intricate and magical patterns scored into the weapon created sweet, musical sounds as the blade moved through the air.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Songblades were magically sharp and strong weapons with which bards could perform their music, and thus use as implements for their spellcasting . Many also granted additional powers, such as magically enriching musical performances, providing bards with a deeper well of magical power, or unleashing loud sounds that could daze foes or rend their armor.</p>
<p>Because the blades required the movement of air across the blade to produce their music, songblades lost most of their utility in environments without air (such as under water or in a vacuum).</p>
