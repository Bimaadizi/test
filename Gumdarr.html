<p>Gumdar was a tortle that lived on the Snout of Omgar long before the era of the Second Sundering .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Gumdar was standing atop a rocky crag on the Snout of Omgar when he heard a ship crash on the shore. He blew a sounding horn to alert his fellow tortles. Together they all pulled out the survivors of the crash.</p>
<p>Later on, this moment was immortalized by the creation of the High Horn statue.</p>
