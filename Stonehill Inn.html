<p>The Stonehill Inn was a quaint inn in the village of Phandalin .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The modest inn was located close to the center of town. It was one of the largest buildings in town.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Newly built in the 15 th century DR , the inn was a large, two-story building was made of unrefined rocks and crudely cut wood.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The villagers of Phandalin, from miners to farmers, enjoyed relaxing in the common room, which became a good place to hear local gossip and stories. The inn was kept neat and clean, and was a generally pleasant place to visit.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Stonehill Inn was owned by Toblen Stonehill , who operated it alongside his wife Trilena Stonehill and with help from his son Pip Stonehill .</p>
<p>The inn provided six rentable rooms on the upper floor, plus alcoholic beverages and food. A bed was five silver pieces a night, and prices were fairly standard for food, ale , and cider , with meals coming to about 1 silver piece . A barmaid called Elsa served drinks at the bar.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Stonehills arrived in Phandalin from Triboar early in the construction of the town, and founded the inn around 1490 DR . During the Redbrands ' reign of terror throughout Phandalin in 1491 DR , the bandits did not frequent the inn, preferring to drink at the Sleeping Giant a few buildings to the east.</p>
<p>Business continued more-or-less as usual during the rampage of the white dragon Cryovain across the countryside. The inn played host to important visitors during this time, such as Don-Jon Raskin , the man who was in charge of reopening the Mountain's Toe gold mines. The inn's common room also became a favorite haunt for Argus Skeel , a vampire spawn in service to the necromancer Ularan Mortus .</p>
<p>By 1496 DR , the inn remained prosperous and largely unchanged. However, at some point the Stonehills had borrowed money from the town banker and former townmaster, Harbin Wester , and he was attempting to leverage the small amount they still owed to take away their business.</p>
