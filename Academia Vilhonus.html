<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Academia Vilhonus was founded some years before the Year of the Late Sun, 300 DR , the year it popularized the facial markings that would become Chondath's tradition for centuries to come. The Academia Vilhonus introduced circular forehead markings to differentiate the learned folk of Chondath from the slave class and other "lessers" in the eyes of the academics and upper class. A single dot placed on a student's forehead indicated their ability to read, two their ability to write, and three their use of the Art . Initially, the dots were nothing but a fashion statement, but with time the markings became identification enforced and protected by Chondathan law.</p>
<p>At some point before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Adamar Session , Bard of Starmantle , visited the Academia Vilhonus during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Vilhon Reach. The bard spent his time in the academy's massive libraries, a visit he later recounted in his guidebook to the Vilhon Reach.</p>
