<p>Ogi-Luc's great robe was a unique enchanted wizard 's robe that once belonged to a Sembian archmage Ogi-Luc .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This great robe was sewn out of heavy and tough Sembian cloth and dyed dark blue, its original master's favorite color.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Ogi-Luc's great robe was created to accentuate and improve Ogi-Luc's already impressive physique. The robe's magic drastically increased the wearer's physical strength and gave them reliable defenses in battle. Additionally, this item enhanced the wearer's constitution.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sembian archmage Ogi-Luc was these curious bones' creator and he wore them into a spell-slinging battle against his enemy, a Red Wizard abjurer named Nesk Vialtim . Ogi-Luc did not survive that faithful encounter and the great robe was claimed as a prize. Subsequently, these enchanted robes were stolen from the Red Wizard by an unnamed but very ambitious thief .</p>
<p>Some time later, by 1281 DR , the Ogi-Luc's Great Robe ended up in the possession of Orrick the Gray , who researched magical mythals in his tower just on the edge of Kuldahar on the Spine of the World .</p>
