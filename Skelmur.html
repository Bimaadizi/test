<p>Skelmur the Stalker was a ghost of an old pirate who haunted Tarmalune 's docks in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Witnesses said that Skelmur only manifested as a pair of floating eyes. However, when preparing to attack, he manifested as a pair of ghostly hands made of mist.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>According to Tarmalune's urban legends, in clear nights Skelmur roamed the city's streets selecting his new victims. His victims were found drowned the next morning, even if they were far away from any water. Some believed that his attacks started because someone found his old treasure. If his bones and treasure were to be found and buried, some believed the old ghost would rest in peace again.</p>
<p>Tarmalune's authorities discarded those tales as fanciful stories, and blamed the killings on criminal gangs instead. Some believed both tales were right, and that a criminal gang was in fact controlling old Skelmur.</p>
