<p>Horo was a type of light armor used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The horo was an uncommon yet straightforward form of protection occasionally worn by mounted warriors. It consisted of several lengthy strips of cloth intricately sewn together. One end was fastened around the neck, while the other was secured near the waist. When the rider was mounted, the cloth catched the wind, billowing out behind them. This method proved effective solely while in motion on horseback.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an underlying wicker framework could be integrated into the horo, enabling it to remain functional at all times. The horo granted protection against projectile attacks aimed solely at their back. It did not provide any additional protection. Typically, the horo showcased vibrant colors and displayed the owner's crest, aiding in the identification of the rider's family and distinguishing them as more than a mere common soldier.</p>
