<p>The Ghostwalk was an alley in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The alley was considered sufficiently safe for the rich inhabitants of the ward to walk by undisturbed. Like other alleys in the Sea Ward, it was clean and wide. It contained numerous shadowtops that were favored by children to climb and play by.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The alley started from a branch in southern Murlpar Street and curled in a crescent shape within the city block between the Street of the Singing Dolphin and Morningstar Way , providing access to homes and service access to the backs of businesses. Another access point into the alley could be found on the Street of Glances .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ghostwalk was named after the harmless ghost of a long-dead Waterdhavian noble who roamed the alley with a sword drawn. The ghost staggered down the alley while whispering and getting progressively drenched in blood, then fading away.</p>
