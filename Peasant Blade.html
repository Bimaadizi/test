<p>Peasant Blades were enchanted kama created to be used as weapons rather than tools of the trade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Peasant Blade was enhanced with a simple +3 enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the weapon significantly boosted the wielder's constitution.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Peasant Blades were once tools used by peasants in the fields, later adapted to be used in battle because they were forbidden from wielding swords . By the late 14 th century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands.</p>
