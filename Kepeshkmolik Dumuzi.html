<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dumuzi was originally a member of Clan Verthisathurgiesh . He was transferred to Clan Kepeshkmolik because he was unable to withstand Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed 's abuses. In his youth, he was also part of the Liberators of the Steel Sky , although he didn't agree with their beliefs, and retired prior to 1486 DR .</p>
<p>In 1486 DR, Dumuzi was sent by Clan Verthisathurgiesh to find Mehen and convince him to return to Djerad Thymar . It took him months, but eventually he was able to find Mehen and convinced him to return. During his time traveling, Dumuzi helped the Cormyrian guard during the siege of Suzail .</p>
<p>When he returned to Djerad Thymar, be began to have strange dreams about a bearded warrior who talked to him in a language Dumuzi couldn't understand. On Nightal 26 , that warrior was revealed to be the god Enlil, who gave Dumuzi the power to destroy a maurezhi servant of the God -king Gilgeam , who was sent to Djerad Thymar to debilitate the city's defenses ahead of the return of Unther to Toril . When the magic of the Second Sundering was about to return Tymanther to Abeir , Dumuzi became the Chosen of Enlil, enabling the god to stop the process and allow most of Tymanther to remain on Toril.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Dumuzi began to proselytize Enlil's faith in Tymanther, which damaged his mother's position in Thymari society.</p>
<p>During the first Tymanther-Unther War , Dumuzi convinced Enlil to allow Asmodeus to get Nanna-Sin 's divine spark in exchange for the Archdevil to bring back the dead god to the life as an immortal being.</p>
