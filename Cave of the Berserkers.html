<p>The Cave of the Berserkers was a cavern system in the Spine of the World named for the Reghedmen barbarians that dwelled within.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The system of caves were located within the northern reaches of the Spine of the World mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These caves were originally formed by a group of dwarven prospectors who sought out valuable minerals and metals.</p>
<p>Some time later, the Reghedmen barbarians took up residence within the tunnels. These berserkers came to be exposed to chardalyn and were tainted by the substance's inherent powers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The barbarians that dwelled within the cave were originally members of the tribe of the Bear . They forsook the worship of the tribe, and rededicated themselves to the Frostmaiden Auril . In return for their devotion, Auril bestowed upon them a sacred blue flame that granted them continual warmth and a form of limited immortality.</p>
<p>Two white dragon wyrmlings also dwelled within the caves, called Gelym and Tyzar .</p>
