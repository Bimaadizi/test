<p>Gultoss was a noble family of Ravens Bluff in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Gultoss family's main branch operated commercial interests in and around Ravens Bluff, serving on its Council of Lords . Other family members were scattered across Faer√ªn , however, because the Gultoss family produced a number of seafaring adventurer offspring. Those who survived their adventuring days went on to dwell in places such as Amn , Waterdeep , and various settlements on the Lake of Steam 's coastline, so Ravens Bluff was home to relatively few Gultossans compared to other families.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Gultoss family were considered one of Ravens Bluff's more reserved noble families. There, they concerned themselves with trade, focusing mainly on shipbuilding, shipping, and fishing. Their investments typically enjoyed little success, however, so they remained rather poor for nobility. Lord Huehm, the liveliest of the Gultossans, was an exception and enjoyed great success as a spice trader specializing in cinnamon , nutmeg , and saffron from Sembia .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Gultossan Towers was the family's seaside compound north of Ravens Bluff. It featured a keep fortified with a garrison of twenty as well as farmland and fisheries enough to sustain the family, garrison, and a staff of fifty within its walls.</p>
<p>Seabreeze Hall , an ornate house on the east side of Lamorgyr's Ride in the Sixstar neighborhood, was the Gultoss family residence in Ravens Bluff.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Gultoss family counted the financially savvy Indemmer family among their firm friends.</p>
<p>Gultoss also was one of only thirteen families recognized by the Zorden family as legitimate members of the Council of Lords.</p>
