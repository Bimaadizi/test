<p>The Black Library of Hudid carried all manner of foul tomes, scrolls , and other dangerous and heretical writings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was said that when priests of Zann , the Zakharan god of learning, discovered writings that they deemed dangerous, but that they could neither keep nor destroy, that they sent them to the Black Library for safe keeping in Hudid. Any dark scholar lucky enough to gain explicit permission from Hudid's caliph to enter the library could find information about holy slayer fellowships, dark elemental rituals, secrets about the Brotherhood of the True Flame , and ancient heretical beliefs from the Ruined Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A pair of incredibly stout dao guarded the library.</p>
