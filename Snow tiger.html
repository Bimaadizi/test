<p>Snow tigers were large predatory felines native to Rashemen and distantly related to the red tigers of the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snow tigers were capable of changing the color of their outer coat to match the season. Coloration ranged from pale brown striped with green in the spring and summer to white and black stripes in late autumn and winter.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Snow tigers were normally solitary creatures. Mating pairs could be encountered during the spring and summer months.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A snow tiger's claws and fangs were formidable weapons. Their attuned senses made it nearly impossible to sneak up on them in the wild. They were capable of blinding bursts of speed over short amounts of time.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Though native to Rashemen, snow tigers could be found in other cool areas of north Faerûn and east Faerûn . They preferred to hunt larger prey animals such as deer , but would kill much smaller animals if necessary to survive the long winter months. Most snow tigers avoided humans and would only attack if cornered or provoked.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rashemaar berserkers revered the snow tiger for its speed, strength, and hunting prowess. There was even a dedicated snow tiger berserker lodge. The berserkers considered it a great honor to successfully hunt a snow tiger. Rashemaar nobles proved their skill by hunting them alone with only a broadsword or bow . These creatures were featured in many Rashemaar legends.</p>
<p>Snow tiger cubs were sometimes taken and raised as pets and trained to hunt alongside humans. A cub needed to be taken before it was three months old for this to work.</p>
<p>Snow tiger pelt cloaks were a symbol of status among the Rashemaar. These cloaks were never sold and worn only by those who slew the snow tiger. A Rashemaar would attack anyone caught wearing a snow tiger cloak under false pretenses.</p>
