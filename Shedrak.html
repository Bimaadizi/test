<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shedrak went with an adventuring party to Wormwrithings. However, the others were captured and killed by a beholder, Karazikar . Through great luck, Shedrak survived its eye rays. Intrigued, Karazikar decided to make him its slave, and he soon became its favorite.</p>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , an expedition led by some adventurers, hired by Bruenor Battlehammer to investigate the threat of the demon lords , came to Wormwrithings. They were in need of the central eye of a beholder for a rite to banish the demon lords. Shedrak was confronted and possibly killed along with his master by the adventurers.</p>

<p>Karazikar had broken Shedrak's mind in order to make him its slave. Shedrak considered the beholder a god and would not tolerate any impudence or resistance to the beholder.</p>
