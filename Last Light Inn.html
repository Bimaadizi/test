<p>The Last Light Inn was a tavern located in Reithwin in the Western Heartlands in the late 14 th and 15 th centuries DR . It served as the secret base of the Selûnite resistance by the innkeeper Halfred to oppose Ketheric Thorm , until the general's fall. It remained abandoned for a century until Isobel Thorm used it to hide from Ketheric, later attracting the attention of the Harpers .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The tavern was located just outside the town, beside the River Chionthar . Two bridges across the water allowed access to the Last Light, though since the shadow curse , only the southeast bridge was usable. A small burial ground lay to the northeast, as well as a small house.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was a two-story building; the ground floor was the taproom featuring the bar and a large number of tables curtained-off into booths by various tapestries, as well as a couple of rooms for guests. On the second floor, there extra rooms and a balcony overlooking the River Chionthar. The basement was smaller, and was mainly used for storage. It did, however, have a secret exit that led to a small enclave and house just outside. The basement was primarily used by Halfred to help organize the Selûnite resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inn housed a dock from the Chionthar, allowing small boats to dock underneath. Outside of the main building itself, a small forge allowed those versed in blacksmithing to craft weapons and armor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>14 th Century</h3>
<p>Around 1373 DR , the then owner of the inn, Halfred, secretly met and organized with those loyal to Selûne to oppose Ketheric Thorm and his Dark Justiciars. On his death, Ketheric laid a shadow curse on the land, forcing Reithwin and the Last Light Inn to be abandoned for around a hundred years.</p>
<h3>15 th century</h3>
<p>After being resurrected by Balthazar in the late 1400s DR, Ketheric's daughter Isobel, horrified with her father's change, fled to the abandoned Last Light Inn there. There, she cast a spell that enveloped the building and a small portion of the surrounding area in Selûne's grace, protecting it from the shadow-curse. This created a safe haven for those seeking shelter, for so long as Isobel herself remained alive.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , agents of the Harpers and Flaming Fist headed by Jaheira came to Reithwin to investigate Ketheric's own return from the dead. Jaheira and Isobel became acquainted and Isobel gifted the groups with a blessing of Selûne providing a limited protection from the shadow curse when outside the inn, as Isobel herself needed to stay at the Last Light to maintain concentration on the moon shield. Soon thereafter, a group of adventurers came to the location seeking protection from the shadow-curse, and met Jaheira and her Harpers, who directed them to Isobel.</p>
