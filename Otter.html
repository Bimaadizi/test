<p>Otters were a species of aquatic mammal distantly related to weasels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Otters were very fast moving creatures, both in terms of running and swimming. Those that inhabited oceans were typically larger than their more land-locked kin.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were very friendly and had a very playful nature. During storms, sea otters tended to come ashore or swim upriver, searching for shelter inside alcoves or small caves. Some would simply wait on the banks of rivers and wait for the storm to pass.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Sea otters seemingly possessed an innate sense of how severe coming storms would be. They could remain underwater for extended periods of time.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Otters generally tried to avoid combat. They were only known to attack other creatures when threatened, cornered, or their young were threatened.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many years prior to 1492 DR , the wizard Traxigor was polymorph ed into an otter. He came to conclude that he preferred his new form to that of his elderly body and used the spell wish to make it permanent.</p>
