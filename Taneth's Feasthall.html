<p>Taneth's Feasthall , also often referred to as Taneth's Festhall , or simply Taneth's , was a notable festhall in Suzail , the capital city of Cormyr , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Taneth's Feasthall stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand Promenade , on a street that crossed the Court Close that laid to the west of the establishment. Travelers who walked along the Court Close from the Promenade moving south needed to turn east once they passed Zhaelun's Stockyard . Then, moving east past the stockyard and the next two buildings, they reached the Mare's Tail tavern on the street's northern side. Across from it, to the south, stood Taneth's. The renowned Silver Cord Theatre stood nearby the festhall.</p>
