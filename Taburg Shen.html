<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the Shen family migrated to Cormyr from Durpar , by way of Chessenta . Tabard's father was Thontravur Shen and mother â€“ Velveira Almarrand , a Sembian merchant noblewoman. Taburg's sister, Randarla Shen , was an adventuring sort who eventually met her end on Zhentarim blades, after joining Harpers . Taburg met and moon married Shalarla , a strong Dalesfolk, with whom they sired three daughters: Haethe , Raedaerle , and Tarsarra .</p>
<p>Taburg died first between the spouses. Shalarla outlived the man and survived well into her twilight years. Still, eventually, both were buried on the farm by the Shen daughters, who decided to stay unmarried and run the farm while aiding elves of Cormanthor against Zhents in their spare time.</p>
