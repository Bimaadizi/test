<p>Raelrur's Run was a side street in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Descripton</h2>
<p>Raelrur's Run began at the North Way very close to Farrgaunlar (the southern gate into Khôltar) and headed east until it reached the unnamed road just inside the wall that circled the city and connected all the guard towers. Upon entering Farrgaunlar, Darvoro's Plates was the first building to the right (east), then came Raelrur's Run, and then Pauntraal , the garthraun (police) headquarters and duty house. Turning down Raelrur's Run, there were guarded warehouses along most of its length until the last building on the left (north): Mother Talasko's .</p>
