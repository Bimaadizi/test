<p>A titanstring bow was a type of enchanted longbow that relied on the raw physical strength of the owner for its damage.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Titanstring bows were proof that the thin and slender archer stereotype was a false one. This powerful bow could only be fully pulled by an individual of great strength and wrists of iron.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Apart from a regular +1 enchantment to the bow's aim and damage output, a titanstring bow 's power was dependent on the wielder's muscles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , titanstring bows could be purchased from one of the Zhentarim 's smugglers and merchants named Brem , who laired underneath the Waukeen's Rest inn, and from a bugbear merchant Lann Tarv who served the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers .</p>
