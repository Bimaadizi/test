<p>The Coral Princess was a yikarian member of the Seven Sages and governor of the Sun's Eye province of the Land of the Yak-Men in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Coral Princess was an albino , a rarity among the yak-folk.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Coral Princess ruled her province from the city of Lipo on the coast of Pearl Bay . Perhaps because of the distance separating her from the heart of the Yikarian Empire , the Coral Princess was rather liberal and accepting compared to her kin. She traded freely with foreigners from the barbarian north, whereas most yak-folk of the "heartlands" would enslave any foreigner on sight.</p>
