<p>The Forgotten God was a mysterious deity worshiped at a temple in the Spine of the World mountains.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Nothing was known about the Forgotten God except that his priests, referred to as acolytes, gained priestly powers from someone. Giant statues of a robed hooded figure stood outside the temple and another sat in meditation inside the entrance to the temple. This figure could be the Forgotten God, or someone else.</p>
