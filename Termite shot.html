<p>Termite shot was a specific variety of mage shot that, when it collided upon impact, released a brown viscous syrup that was particularly damaging to wood. After the syrupy substance was exposed it would bubble over and immediately weaken and dissolve any wood with which it made contact. This damage could not be magically stopped except by the spell dispel magic .</p>
