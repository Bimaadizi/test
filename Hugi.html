<p>Hugi was a young and quite limber giant in Jotunheim , the land of giants in the plane of Ysgard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff journeyed to the plane of Ysgard in the Great Wheel cosmology in search of the legendary Well of Mimir , having been instructed by the city's Ministry of Art to do so in order to learn how a powerful githyanki artifact known only as the Great Machine could be destroyed. While in traveling in Jotunheim they met Habrok Icecaster and, after proving their worth to him by slaying a bulette , he brought them to the beer-hall Okalnir . Sensing the hall's giants were indifferent towards the adventurers, the hall's proprietor Brimir proposed a contest of four tests. He was even willing to wager three magic items if the adventurers would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a Svartalfheim cloak , a horn of Valhalla , and a great war maul known as Grungir's hammer .</p>
<p>Hugi, who was visiting Okalnir at the time, was chosen as the giant champion of running. In the third of four tests, he competed to be the first to reach the far end of the hall, with various tables and other furniture being pushed out of the way to accommodate the test. The rules of the test was the best of three would be the final winner. Hugi, not expecting great speed from the smallfolk, held back so as to give them a sporting chance.</p>
