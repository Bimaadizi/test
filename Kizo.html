<p>Kizo was a flatulent blue ox beast of burden that belonged to an eccentric merchant named Yani Pavani circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kizo's entire career consisted of dragging the overeager merchant's wagon across the Sword Coast . The beast accompanied its owner to the hamlet of Liam's Hold in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , where Yani Pavani forced her interior decoration skills on the Hero of Daggerford â€“the new proud owner of the Stronghold keep. When the duo's work was over, Yani decided to stay in the quaint town for a while, and Kizo was happy to chew on the hamlet's abundant over-ripe greenery.</p>
