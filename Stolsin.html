<p>Stolsin , the Grinder of Tribes , was a Rashemi barbarian working for Sathra in Laothkund until 1375 DR . He was slain by Gage , raised, and then slain again.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stolsin was a towering man with thickly muscled arms, and many tattoos that marked him as a member of the tribes of Rashemen . His beard was festooned with stone trinkets.</p>
<p>In death, his tattoos writhed and squirmed as if with life of their own, and tendrils of shadow appeared to animate him. His maul and mouth also dripped with an inky miasma, and his tongue was swollen and dry.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While alive, Stolsin was dangerously boisterous, continuing to extol his deeds even during combat. In death, not so much.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In life, Stolsin handled an immense, gray stone maul without trouble. He still did so in death, also feeling no pain.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Stolsin carried around an immense maul as his weapon.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Stolsin became a thug for Sathra of the Shadow Tongue in Laothkund until 1375 DR . He continued to serve under her for a little time after dying.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1375 DR , Stolsin had destroyed walking dead in the outskirts of Thay , and dared the cold drake's icy lair somewhere. While working as one of Sathra's Shadow Tongue thugs in Laothkund, however, he was slain by Gage , wielding Angul , or perhaps by Angul wielding Gage.</p>
<p>Sathra raised him as undead so as to track Gage down into the Yuirwood , using a link that Stolsin had with his killer; once he tracked down Gage, Stolsin attacked again. Gage managed to slice off the former barbarian's foot, but got clipped in the head and knocked out with one last swing. When he woke up, Kiril Duskmourn had dispatched their enemies.</p>
