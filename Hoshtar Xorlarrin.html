<p>Hoshtar Xorlarrin was a drow wizard of Menzoberranzan and cousin to House Wizard Ravel of House Xorlarrin .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the tradition of his house, Hoshtar wore a red veil over his face.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hoshtar could be influenced by those who showed knowledge about arcane matters or fed his ego. He thumped his chest and clapped an employee on the shoulder when he was pleased.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hoshtar was his family's representative for an alliance with House Melarn and Bregan D'aerthe in handling a party of adventurers . They first sent the team to gain power for Lolth 's Demon Weave scheme. This was a task in which he had spent much effort himself. For the expedition, he asked adventurers loyal to his house to retrieve a letter from the previous party that had been lost on the same mission. The message was a letter that Guannerrae Tlabbar had retrieved in the Underdark , written in Xorlarrin code, with no recipient named. It was written to Faelas Xorlarrin , a master of Sorcere , and its content was about how the Goddess's current plan supported the idea of wizards joining the Ruling Council .</p>
<p>After the adventurers returned from their first mission, Hoshtar was invited to meet with members of the Council of Spiders by his cousin, Raelaryn Xorlarrin . At the meeting, a Jaezred Chaulssin assassin killed Raelaryn and captured Hoshtar. The alliance's hired team managed to rescue him. Regardless of the alliance's decision on how to deal with the civil war, it was unanimous in sending the adventurers to eliminate the leader of the assassins .</p>
