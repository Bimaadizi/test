<p>The armor of the Warblade , also known as the Warblade's reflection , was a kind of clothing and armor found in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR , magically derived from the legendary Warblade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These reflections took the form of various pieces of elven armor and clothing with a consistent silver and blue appearance, including light , medium , and heavy armor , cloaks , robes , helmets , whole outfits, and docent -like trinkets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items were exceptionally protective and aided the wearer's prowess in combat. Cloaks caused a defensive light distortion, while helms let the wearer focus and draw upon truly heroic reserves of energy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These disparate pieces of gear were created when the echo of the Warblade defiantly broke from the Warblade proper, creating an array of linked magical items from pure magic. These remained in Myth Drannor, waiting to be found by those like Tannivh Dahast 's Cormanthor Elves and the Red Wizards of Droic Orgul . The Red Wizards further strengthened these items, but their connection to the Warblade let them withstand the corruptive evil of their rituals.</p>
