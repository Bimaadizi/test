<p>Shields of shielding were enchanted shields that were imbued with protective magics.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A shield of shielding allowed the wielder to cast the shield spell once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that the shields of shielding were named in the style of Extremely Unimaginative Jimmy , the man credited with creating the words of "waterfall" and "fireplace." During the Absolute crisis in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a shield of shielding was among offerings made for the deity Helm at the Stormshore Tabernacle in Baldur's Gate . The magic item was sealed away in the temple's basement vault. Anyone daring enough to steal a shield of shielding would end up being cursed by the gods and attacked by Helm's servant devas .</p>
