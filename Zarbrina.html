<p>Zarbrina was the name given in the Realms to cerussite , an extremely soft lead-like mineral, colorless and easily cut into brilliant faceted gems.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to its softness, this ornamental stone was often used in ceremonial or little-used jewelry, or set in small protective metal claw mounts on sleeves or collar-hems of gowns. Because it felt soapy to the touch, small zarbrina stones could be used on fancy intimate apparel or sewn into bed linens without causing discomfort. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powdered zarbrina could be used as an ingredient for magical ink when dealing with illusion magic.</p>
