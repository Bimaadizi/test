<p>Tilverton was a large town located on the Moonsea Ride in Tilver's Gap near the eastern edge of the Stonelands . Formerly an independent town, it was annexed by Cormyr in 1356 DR and governed as a protectorate, only to be destroyed in 1372 DR by a magical disaster during the invasion by Thultanthar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Tilverton was located at the western entrance of Tilver's Gap on flat plains between the wastelands of the Stonelands and the foothills of the Thunder Peaks , and stood at the intersection of the North Ride and the Moonsea Ride. The Moonsea Ride ran south to Arabel and the rest of Cormyr, and east to Mistledale and the Cormanthor forest. The North Ride passed north across the Shadow Gap , through Shadowdale and ultimately to the Moonsea.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Tilverton was traditionally governed by a council of elected citizens, which for a time was effectively led by the charismatic and popular priest of Gond Gharri . After the city's annexation, Gharri briefly served as Lord Regent on behalf of Cormyr, but he quickly became disillusioned by what he saw as a puppet role that simply relayed the commands of the Dragon Throne. After he abandoned the city in disgust, the city council elected the Suzailan Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle , who proceeded to rule the city to the benefit of the Crown, until Tilverton was destroyed in 1372 DR.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Tilverton depended on fur trappers, loggers, prospectors, and hunters from the Thunder Peaks and Storm Horns , as well as a small industry of fine mechanism crafting by the Temple of Gond Wondermaker that gave the town some fame and prosperity. Tilverton also served as a vital caravan and drover stop along the Moonsea Ride and North Ride, as Tilver's Gap was the only viable passage for hundreds of miles. After Cormyr secured the city, it experienced an influx of hunters, trappers, and prospectors from Arabel who sought new and profitable opportunities, a local pottery industry sprang up for export, and horse ranchers in the hills began breeding, doctoring and training good mounts.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Tilverton was historically built around Tilver's Palace , the castle home of Tilvara , atop a steep knoll that rose above the flat plains, accompanied by a sizable underground settlement. As time went on the city sprawled out around the hill, but no serious defenses were developed, which came to a critical conclusion in 1356 DR when the city was besieged by an army of orcs .</p>
<p>After being annexed by Cormyr, Tilverton was heavily fortified as it became the realm's farthest outpost. It served as a vital strongpoint in Tilver's Gap that allowed the realm greater power in the Dalelands and Stonelands , a vital goal as at the time the region was threatened by the Zhentarim and Lashan Aumersair .</p>
<p>Once in control of the city, extensive earthworks and large stone walls were built around it, granting it the first real fortifications in centuries. The city was granted a permanent garrison of 850 Purple Dragons and a number of War Wizards , who provided peacekeeping in the city and patrolled the lands around it. The road patrols were heavily prepared for sudden monster or brigand attacks, and rode from Tilverton on warhorses , with a main body of 40 veteran soldiers on with plate armor , lances , and other implements of war. These lancers rode with 10-20 specialized cavalry archers that carried longbows and four quivers each that held a total of 84 flight arrows , and up to three War Wizards laden with enough scrolls and potions to support the entire patrol.</p>
<p>Inside of Tilverton, a typical street patrol was made up of 10-20 greener soldiers and one or two wizards, equipped with slings rather than bows. Each of the city gates had a complement of 26 dedicated archers who could be deployed to support troops inside the city.</p>
<p>In times of emergency, the city council could muster a militia to defend the city. Up to 470 locals could be found with the requisite experience and personal arms, consisting of adventurers, trappers, and hunters who were well-practiced and familiar with the region.</p>
<p>The most consistent problem for Cormyr's forces in the city were the Rogues of Tilverton thieves' guild , who had a significant "army" of thieves and other agents who spied, stole, and fenced in spite of persistent efforts to oppose them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tilverton was founded around Tilver's Palace , the home of the archmage Tilvara . A trading settlement grew up around and beneath it, inhabited by elves and humans, though eventually Tilvara died, her keep fell to ruin, and the underground settlement was forgotten and converted into the city's sewers. Tilverton grew into a small town of prestigious, wealthy buildings atop the hill of the Old Town , surrounded by a muddy sea of stockyards, caravan campgrounds, and rough homes.</p>
<p>In the early 14 th century DR , the priest of Gond Gharri arrived in town and founded the Temple of Gond Wondermaker atop the hill, providing technological innovations to the town and inspiring the manufacture of mechanical wonders such as toothed gears and intricate locks. He became the de facto leader of the town through his popularity.</p>
<p>In 1356 DR , the city came under threat from Zhentilar raids and warbands of orcs and goblins that had overrun Daggerdale , as well as the expansionism of Lashan Aumersair 's empire in the Dalelands . In Tarsakh , Cormyr sent an army from High Horn to fortify the Tilver's Gap region against the oncoming dangers, defeating an army of orcs in Kythorn and relieving Tilverton. By Flamerule , the town had agreed to annexation by Cormyr, coming under the rule of Gharri as Lord Regent, as Duke Bhereu Ammaeth prosecuted the ongoing war in Daggerdale against the Zhentarim . Not only did this provide the town with much improved security, it also provided Cormyr with a strong base from which to project forces into the Dalelands and the Stonelands , and prevented Zhentil Keep from claiming it for itself. Although he had agreed with the necessity of protecting the town, Gharri left the town soon after in Mirtul of 1357 DR as he realized that he was now just a puppet of Cormyr. The town then came under the governance of the former Purple Dragon Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle , who was approved by the town's council of elders.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Tilverton was greatly expanded and built up by the efforts of Cormyr. A permanent garrison of 850 Purple Dragons was stationed to protect the city and patrol the surrounding lands, keeping the routes to the Dalelands and Moonsea open despite regular threats emerging from the Stonelands . The stockyards and campgrounds were torn down and relocated outside of a newly-built earthen rampart and ditch, which was then replaced by a great stone curtain wall. The muddy streets were paved and new stone structures built to replace the wooden shanty-town, and hundreds of Cormyreans migrated to the city seeking new opportunities. Although some Tilverians complained about the domination by Cormyr, the vast majority came to appreciate the prosperity that Cormyrean merchants brought, and the security that the Cormyrean soldiers and the new city wall provided.</p>
<p>By 1358 DR , the Rogues of Tilverton had driven the agents of both the Zhentarim and the Dragon Cult out of Tilverton, to establish themselves as an outlaw force with which to be reckoned. Even a brief foray by the Fire Knives was repelled.</p>
<p>During the Return of the Archwizards in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it was revealed that the Netherese of Thultanthar were responsible for catastrophic weather disasters in the Heartlands . Cormyr made preparations to launch open war on Netheril and destroy Thultanthar , but the Shadovar marched on Cormyr first and assaulted Tilverton on Mirtul 27 . The city was evacuated before the battle by Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle with the expectation that the city would be ravaged by the battle, but Royal Magician Vangerdahast 's attempts to counter Rivalen Tanthul 's Shadow Weave magics caused a disaster and Tilverton was destroyed in a cataclysm of shadowstuff that subsumed the entire city and the surrounding land, leaving a hollow crater filled with animate shadows.</p>
<p>By Greengrass of 1373 DR , the survivors of Tilverton had returned and built a new town a few miles away, naming it New Tilverton . In Marpenoth of the same year, an unidentified creature began attacking and killing the inhabitants of New Tilverton, leaving their remains on the road to the ruins of the former city. The ruined former city and its crater eventually became known as the Tilverton Scar .</p>
<h2>Places of Interest</h2>
<p>The Old Town of Tilverton was the traditional core of the city atop a fortified knoll, and was home to regal manors, gardens, and ruins. It could be accessed by four different gates each with a religious shrine, three of which were reached by stairs.</p>
<p>The city had extensive and ancient sewers that originated with the long-lost elven and human trading settlement that accompanied the reign of the archwizard Tilvara . It was since taken over by criminal elements, such as the Rogues of Tilverton and the Fire Knives .</p>
<h3>Inns & Taverns</h3>
<p>Taverns were uncommon in Tilverton, and most thirsty citizens were served by roaming horse-drawn wagons that carried casks of drink.</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR Tilverton had over four-dozen rooming houses, with more opening up every summer as the city was flooded with travelers and frontiersmen. They filled up in summer with horse traders and hunters, but were near-desolate in winter with only trappers passing through, along with occasional off-duty soldiers looking for a quiet place to relax. There were no restaurants in the city, with meals obtained from the three inns of Tilverton, though alley-kitchens supplied soup and bread to savvy locals.</p>
