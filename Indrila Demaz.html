<p>Indrila Demaz was the Queen of Velprin and leader of the human army that invaded the Yuirwood in response to attacks from the half-elves living there. She became queen in 1058 DR . A year later, in 1059 DR , she drove the half-elves further back into the forest. Eventually, in 1065 DR , Indrila was defeated by Brindor Ol√≥synne at the Battle of Ingdal's Arm . This triggered the surrender of the humans and the formation of Aglarond .</p>
