<p>" Noble eladrin " was a term used, specifically between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering , to refer to a subcategory of eladrin of particularly powerful magic or nobility. The phrase did not have a precise meaning and included a wide variety of races and individuals.</p>
<p>Some noble eladrin were high elves living in the Feywild who had become so infused with the power of that place as to become entirely new creatures, taking on aspects of the seasons and other natural phenomena.</p>

<h2>Noble Eladrin Titles</h2>
<p>Nobility among eladrin was not a matter of inheritance but rather fame and mystical power. In some eladrin lands, specific titles, such as "coure", "bralani", and "ghaele", were given to eladrin of great power over particular spheres, such as "autumn winds", or "winter". The title of "shiere knight" was given to noble eladrin who dedicated themselves to defending the Feywild from its foes. Other eladrin—often shiere knights—specifically guarded Tiandra , the Summer Queen, and were known as "shiradi champions". These titles should not be confused with the celestial races of coure , ghaele , bralani , shiere , or shiradi , although the names, no doubt, were related.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , High Lady Ordalf moved the entire fey city of Karador through a portal from the Feywild to Lake Myrloch on the island of Gwynneth . She took over the island from House Kendrick and established herself as ruler of the kingdom of Sarifal, banning all humans from the island. The island became a home for some 50,000 fey beings, many of whom were noble eladrin.</p>
