<p>The House of Fair Trade was a temple in the small frontier city of Nesmé dedicated to Waukeen , that at times acted as the seat of government for the town's theocratic leadership.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building was situated in the center of Nesmé.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This building stood four stories tall, was made of stone, and had a circular shape. It had a peaked roof, what some would describe as spired, supported by wooden beams.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>On the top floor of the temple was a room utilized by the town's leadership. A long stone table adorned it, along with twelve worn chairs and small glass windows.</p>
<p>Inside one of the temple's chambers was a portal that led to an unknown location in Silverymoon . This was used by Lady Alustriel to send adventurers and resources to help the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the disappearance of Waukeen and the decline of her church during the Time of Troubles , this temple was converted into a boarding hall for merchants. Later, following the goddess's return, the building experienced some resurgence as a Waukeenar temple.</p>
<p>When Nesmé was later sacked in 1370 DR by trolls , this temple was one of the few buildings left untouched.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This temple was primarily operated by the high priestess Jygil Zelnathra .</p>
