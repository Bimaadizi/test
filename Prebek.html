<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Prebek, Sanasha, and Xzar were conducting magical experiments to create monsters that resembled goblins . Both young mages were jumpy and wary of intruders, apparently, at least on one occasion, Xzar sent intruders to Prebek's house in the Wave District as a test. The master was indeed a cruel man. Once, Xzar pulled three toenails off Prebek's foot for simply miscasting a cantrip . At the time they were being investigated by the Athkatlan branch of the Harpers . Prebek, Sanasha, and his "creations" may have been ordered killed by Harper Rylock .</p>
