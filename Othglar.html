<p>Othglar was a soldier of Athalantar in the early mid-3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Othglar was one of nigh-four thousand men that were massed in force for the Magelords of Athalantar in 234 DR , ready to strike at the elves of the High Forest . He was a lookout on a cliff overlooking the main camp. One night, as he took a moment to relieve himself, he was slain with his own halberd he'd left aside for a minute, by the priestess of Mystra , Elmara .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A soldier later saw Elmara and assumed the reason Othglar hadn't reported in was because he had been fooling around with her, rather than having been just killed.</p>
