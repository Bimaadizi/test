<p>Iftuu was a drow soldier involved in Vierna Do'Urden's scheme to capture her brother, Drizzt Do'Urden , in Mithral Hall .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Jarlaxle and his Bregan D'aerthe helped Vierna Do'Urden track down Drizzt with the aid of Artemis Entreri .</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>While on lookout for enemies, Iftuu encountered Thibbledorf Pwent who took a second to decide if the drow was actually Drizzt. Iftuu responded by shooting a hand crossbow at Pwent, causing the battlerager to go into a wild frenzy including biting the dark elf's nose and splattering his body against a wall with his spiky armor. As a final touch, Thibbledorf charged the already deceased Iftuu and speared his corpse with his 4 ft (1.2 m) helmet spike.</p>
