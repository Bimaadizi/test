<p>Nisstyre was a drow wizard and leader of the merchant band Dragon's Hoard in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nisstyre was thin, with a sharp-featured face, elegantly pointed ears, and a mane of unusual copper-colored hair that he normally put up in a ponytail.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried no weapons, having the ability to use magic instead.</p>
<h2>Personalty</h2>
<p>Nisstyre was very cunning and shrewd, which was a necessity for being the male leader of an independent group in drow society.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Nisstyre had many contacts on the surface, where he was known as 'the Fox'. He led his band, which was said to be able to obtain anything, no matter the cost. The band were particularly valued for their discretion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nisstyre was originally from Ched Nasad , where he was trained as a wizard. He disliked having to serve the matriarchy of his homeland, and in his explorations he found the worship of the drow god of rogues, Vhaeraun . He left and formed his own independent merchants' group secretly devoted to the glory of Vhaeraun and the expansion of drow settlement on the surface.</p>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Nisstyre's band went to Rashemen to obtain magical artifacts from the Red Wizard Merdrith . They ran into Fyodor , who had stolen the Windwalker amulet, which had been in Merdrith's possession. Nisstyre took the Windwalker from him and attempted to bring it back to Menzoberranzan , but his party was attacked and killed by deep bats and the Windwalker was lost. Nisstyre soon learned that Liriel Baenre had found the Windwalker, so he attempted to retrieve it with the help of Shakti Hunzrin , who placed a ruby scrying gem into his forehead to further communication. In the end, Nisstyre was not able to capture Liriel; rather, she was able to assist the followers of Eilistraee from the Promenade of the Dark Maiden in assaulting and effectively destroying the Dragon's Hoard base in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nisstyre was acquainted with Kharza-kzad Xorlarrin , to whom he provided spellbooks and forbidden books from the surface. He was also the one who attacked Kharza-kzad, prompting the latter to use a wand of lichdom to turn himself into a lich to escape.</p>
<p>Nisstyre's son was Gorlist , who apparently inherited leadership of the remnants of Dragon's Hoard.</p>
<h2>Known Spells</h2>
<p>Among the spells he was capable of were dispel magic , fireball , reveal magic , and frostbind .</p>
