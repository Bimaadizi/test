<p>Deep Glen was a village in the King's Forest of Cormyr that was destroyed during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was deep in the King's Forest southwest of Eveningstar , connected by trails to the wider realm. It was adjacent to the Deep Glen Graveyard , where the local dead were interred.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Hekta Szind set the forces of Sschindylryn to war upon Cormyr, the bulk of the drow army emerged in the King's Forest and marched on Eveningstar. Along the way they destroyed the village of Deep Glen, and the necromancers of House Szind began eagerly animating both the freshly slain villagers and the old buried dead, then sending them into battle.</p>
<p>The Amaunatori priest Barana Talmere heard of this desecration, and so she sent a team to disrupt the necromancy at work. The Cormyrean team found the ruins of the village and fought their way through the graveyard, slaying the invaders and destroying the undead they found.</p>
