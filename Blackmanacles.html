<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , in the guise of a drow trader named Iylinvyx , Dove Falconhand investigated a drow infiltration of Scornubel ; she proposed a trade for glowcap mushrooms at Cata's Pump , being directed there to speak to Sarltan instead. After talking to a drow impersonating the owner, who gave her name as Yamaerthe at Chasper's Trading Tower , she was directed to Daeraude at the Blackmanacles private club, who'd direct her to Sarltan. In turn, Daeraude sent her to someone else.</p>
