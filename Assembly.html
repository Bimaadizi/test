<p>The Assembly was a large meeting hall in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Assembly resembled an enormous barn, with a single large room.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Assembly was used to hold a variety of gatherings, including private, civic, and religious assemblies and events, and as a general meeting place. Locals and outsiders, especially adventurers , who were looking for companionship, gossip, or work gathered there, and "help wanted" notes and other notices were posted on the inside walls. In bad weather, it was used as an under-cover town square or marketplace, where vendors erected market stalls to sell food, drink, and other goods and trinkets. Occasionally, public bouts were hosted, and these were the subject of discreet betting.</p>
