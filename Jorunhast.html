<p>Jorunhast was the High Wizard of Cormyr in the early 11 th to later 13 th centuries DR . He was the pupil of Thanderahast and killed the regent Salember Obarskyr in 1286 DR , for which he was known as Jorunhast Kingslayer . In exile afterward, he built the Tower of Stars on Traitor's Isle . Later in life, he settled in Ser么s and joined the Dukars . He held the Kupavi Dukar Seat of the Nantarn Council of Myth Nantar since the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Around 1018 DR, he was broad-shouldered and muscular, a handsome man to the opposite gender. By 1188 DR , Jorunhast was still broad-shouldered and handsome, with his great age barely apparent, but he had grown fat around the waist. He thought of himself as looking like a baker or Lathanderite friar. As of 1227 DR , his stomach now hung over his belt. At the time, he donned expensive robes of vivid red and black, with a mage's sigil embroidered in gold thread on the breast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As an apprentice wizard, Jorunhast fought against the red dragons who invaded Suzail in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR . He rescued a young lady from a window in the burning Castle Obarskyr , but he fell out of favor with Prince Azoun II , who had been courting her. Jorunhast pursued the black dragon Thauglor and battled him in the King's Forest . Although Jorunhast panicked when faced with Thauglor and tried to prevent Azoun from attacking before the prince laid the decisive blow, Azoun forgave him and the pair were subsequently on better terms.</p>
<p>When King Azoun III died in the Year of the Blade, 1275 DR , Prince Rhigaerd was only six years old, so Azoun III's brother Salember Obarskyr took the throne of Cormyr as regent. However in the Year of the Rock, 1286 DR , Salember plotted to kill Rhigaerd and take the throne, leading Cormyr into civil war. During a parlay, Salember attacked Rhigaerd but Royal Magician Jorunhast stepped in and slew the regent. Although grateful for saving his life, Rhigaerd felt he had to exile Jorunhast for killing a member of the royal family. From then on, he was known as Jorunhast Kingslayer. Jorunhast's choice made Rhigaerd disband the Royal Magician position until the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR , when the king appointed Vangerdahast .</p>
<p>After his exile, Jorunnhast settled in Ser么s and joined the Dukars as their Kupavi lorekeeper with loyalty to Gayar . After the Twelfth Ser么s War in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , he was granted a seat on the Nantarn Council , succeeding Gayar, who died the following year.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As of 1371 DR , Jorunhast's sealed Tower of Stars still existed on Traitor's Isle, an island in Prespur on the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Jorunhast worshiped Mystra .</p>
