<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Fist Gretta was a member of a Flaming Fist troop that accompanied Counselor Florrick and Duke Ravengard on a mission to Elturel . They stopped at the Waukeen's Rest inn, where they fell victim to the Cult of the Absolute 's ambush in which Ulder Ravengard was kidnapped. Florrick and her Fists marched towards the Moonrise Towers to rescue the Duke but were waylaid by the dangers of the Shadow-cursed lands . Fist Gretta and the rest found shelter in the Last Light Inn , where they met High Harper Jaheira and her Harpers , who sought to end the life of General Ketheric Thorm , the leader of the Absolute's army.</p>
<p>When a group of True Souls arrived at the Last Light Inn, Gretta was among those present for the events that followed. It was unknown if she survived the war with the Absolute; she might had perished after the darkness consumed the Last Light Inn, or else she survived with the rest, storming the Moonrise Towers to end General Thorm's reign.</p>
