<p>Xunqaq was the capital city of the beholder realm of Xun'Qoroth .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A two-way portal leading to Ooltul was located somewhere in Xunqaq. This gateway was used nightly to ferry slaves bearing scrolls , gems , minor artifacts of ancient Netheril and new beholder configurations. Once the Sharn Wall was compromised in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the portal functioned as an emergency escape for the phaerimms that secretly ruled the realm.</p>
