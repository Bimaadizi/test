<p>Grint Thorg was an adventurer and a fighter from the city of Baldur's Gate who died some years before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grint Thorg perished sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR while adventuring in the infamous Tower of Durlag on the Sword Coast . The fighter's body could not be recovered by the adventuring comrades so instead of Grint, the comrades buried Thorg's 10 feet (3 meters) pole in the Lower City Graveyard , near the cemetery arched gate and the Durinbold Mausoleum . The gravestone was etched with a single inscription: "Grint Thorg, Fighter, Lost in Durlag's Tower. We couldn't recover your body so we buried your ten-foot pole ." The final resting spot may had been accidentally desecrated, and his body risen as a zombie by Nina Dortmell , a talented child with a gift , who was trying to resurrect her recently deceased brother.</p>
