<p>Saint Sollars , called the Twice Martyred , was a saint of the faith of Ilmater the Crying God. He was the patron saint of Bloodstone Pass .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Within the church of Ilmater , St. Sollars was venerated by the Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred and at the Monastery of the Yellow Rose in the Earthspur Mountains and the Abbey of St. Sollars located in Bloodstone Village in Damara . He was viewed as a patriarch of the faith. It was the only faith to have a saint known as "the Twice-Martyred" and many Ilmatari hoped to follow his path.</p>
<p>The people of Damara particularly venerated Ilmater and St. Sollars. Many Damarans, even those who followed other gods, felt a special closeness to St. Sollars, knowing the virtues of endurance in the face of hardship. The yellow rose of St. Sollars was a common sight in the realm.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>His symbol was a yellow rose, which was adopted by the Monks of the Yellow Rose, and a lone, five-pointed star. The Abbey of St. Sollars employed both symbols, where literature related to the saint displayed the lone star.</p>
<h2>Works</h2>
<p>The Book of St. Sollars was a religious tome consisting of numbered verses. A copy rested on the altar of the Abbey of St. Sollars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As his title suggested, St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred died in martyrdom, returned to life, and died as a martyr once more, a heroic feat for which he was sainted.</p>
<p>St. Sollars was long dead by the 14th century DR . The Disciples of St. Sollars the Twice-Martyred had crossed over the Great Glacier , over the lands that would later be known as Damara and Vaasa, whilst both realms still lay beneath the ice. In the Year of the Yellow Rose, 1242 DR , they founded the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, also known as the Citadel of the White Worm.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , an adventuring party comprising Sir Gareth Dragonsbane , Olwen Forest-Friend , Friar Dugald , Riordan Parnell , Celedon Kierney , and Emelyn the Gray was faced with the perilous quest of pursuing the Witch-King Zhengyi through a gate into the Abyss , in order to end his threat to Damara forever. As they hesitated at this nightmarish and deadly expedition, St. Sollars appeared behind them to offer encouragement, refresh their divinely granted magic, and explained what they needed to do. He informed them that Bahamut wanted to prevent Orcus —Zhengyi's patron—from getting to the Material Plane . St. Sollars then tasked them with traveling through the Abyss to the realm of Orcus, where they were to steal his famed wand and deliver it to him in the Celestial planes.</p>
<p>Traveling through dozens of Abyssal layers , they finally made their way to Orcus' realm on the 333rd layer, where they snuck into the demon lord's castle and successfully stole the Wand of Orcus . They then fled to the Astral Plane , where they were rescued from pursuing demons by Terxyx , a tome archon , and a troop of sword archons , who served St. Sollars and would escort them to meet him. They traveled to Mercuria in the Seven Heavens , to St. Sollars' realm at Castle Al-Amo . To destroy the wand, St. Sollars directed them to Bahamut, who in turn predicted that the Wand of Orcus needed to be bathed in the blood of a slain avatar of Tiamat , the Dragon Queen. After the slaying the avatar and destroying the Wand , and a last meeting with Bahamut, St. Sollars healed the heroes, rewarded them with wishes , and let them rest in the Seven Heavens for a day before sending them on their way.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When meeting with Gareth Dragonsbane and party, St. Sollars appeared as a man, short and stocky of build, with huge white angel's wings. He had a very distinctive accent. He wore a white robe, smoked a cheap cigar, and conjured beer for the group. When he vanished, he took the beer, and left only the smell of cheap cigar smoke.</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>St. Sollars resided in the plane of Seven Heavens , on the layer of Mercuria , where he had a golden castle called Castle Al-Amo , the Fortress of Love. He described it as "his spread".</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As a saint, Sollars served the god Ilmater, the One Who Endures.</p>
<p>St. Sollars also revered the god Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, whom he called "the big boss".</p>
<p>St. Sollars was served by Terxyx , a tome archon , who in turn led a squad of at least twenty sword archons .</p>
<p>St. Sollars opposed the demon lord Orcus, Prince of the Undead, who he said was a "bad hombre" and "the meanest dude this side o' the Pecos ".</p>
