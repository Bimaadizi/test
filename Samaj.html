<p>Samaj was an ormyrr merchant of the Sharpstick clan who laired in the city of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, the ormyrr of the Sharpstick clan were divided by the dark mind-affecting magics of the Cult of the Dragon . The usurper chief Pujik allied himself with the cultists after being driven mad by Kya Mordrayn 's pool of radiance , while Retha , the old leader, was trying to stop the evil ormyrr. Samaj remained loyal to the tribe's true leader. Subsequently, a group of heroes, the Veiled Ones , confronted Pujik and killed the slave of the Cult. The tribe was freed from the Cult's corruption. In reward, Samaj offered the heroes the loyalty of the tribe as well as access to many magical treasures the ormyrr gathered in the ruins of the ancient city.</p>
