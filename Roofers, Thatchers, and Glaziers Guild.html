<p>The Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild was an association of roofers, slate-masons, shingle-cutters, thatchers, thatch-cutters, glaziers, sandglass makers, glass stainers of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The guild's insignia depicted three pink human hands on a red diamond-shaped background. The hand at the bottom reached towards the center of the diamond with its finger and thumb curling into an oval shape. Above the oval were the other two hands on both sides touching fingertips to form a shape of a roof.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Members of the Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild had a reputation of being the most easygoing of all the trades guilds of Cormyr. They were often late to the contracted jobs and tended to disappear for at least an entire day without deeming to notify of the absence or its reasoning. The same easygoing attitude also meant that members of the Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild were often available to be "day hires," working alone with a single assistant, precocious youth, and sluggards who had no experience in the trade. Although this was never the case for glaziers or glassworkers.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild's headquarters was the Hardshutters House that stood on the northernmost end of Suzail 's Market plaza , facing towards it on the crossing of Garth Street . The 14 th century guildmaster custom-ordered a spell developed to magically animate glass shards that the guild members stored in the headquarters's attic. The shards were broken leftovers brought from numerous jobs performed by the guild. If an intruder appeared within the guild house or other trouble arose, the guildmaster opened the attic hatch and summoned the deadly whirlwind of glass with the use of a special enchanted finger- ring . This tornado of glass was similar to the effects of the blade barrier spell .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , the guidmaster was Ullvor Mharivven , a male human rogue who appreciated finery and theatrics. He organizes exhibitions to improve the guild's reputation in Suzail and to jumpstart new fashionable trends in the industry. He was notorious for spreading rumors of ghost hauntings in order to buy, demolish and rebuild, or just renovate buildings.</p>
