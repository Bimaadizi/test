<p>Splugoth the Returned, previously known as Splug , was a goblin who briefly collaborated with Acquisitions Incorporated before being betrayed and left for dead by the company. Sometime before the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , he was resurrected by the lich Jeff Magic and ended up in charge of the Six 's operation to get its hands on the Orrery of the Wanderer .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Splugoth had one pale eye.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Splug was a pathological liar.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Splugoth had a limited ability to stop physical effects using residual energy from Jeff Magic's resurrection magic. He also recalled some words he heard on his way back to the world of the living, which he could recite to momentarily overwhelm those who heard them.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>By the time he attempted to conduct the ritual to trigger an incursion from the Far Realm , Splugoth might've had any number of components of the Orrery of the Wanderer , at least including the far gear .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Due to his betrayal by the company, Splugoth was deeply resentful towards Acquisitions Incorporated. He also had a history with the "C" Team .</p>
<p>Splugoth looked up to Jeff Magic, and considered him to be a "real hero".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Years before his first run-in with Acquisitions Incorporated, Splug was part of a goblin tribe that lived beneath Shadowfell Keep , dominated by the sorcerer and death cult leader Kalarel . Unpopular with his fellow goblins, he ended up incarcerated after conning several tribe members out of their ale .</p>
<p>When Acquisitions Incorporated came to the keep in order to stop Kalarel's plan to free what Splug described as a "death god", the goblin somehow assisted them in doing so. Despite his help, the company apparently left Splug to die in order to save one of its team members.</p>
<p>Eventually, Splug was resurrected by Jeff Magic, at which point he took on the name Splugoth the Returned. The lich put him in charge of obtaining all components of the Orrery of the Wanderer in the name of the Six, mainly through coordinating raids. In this capacity he hired a number of operatives and mercenaries, including the jackalwere Hamebi , a battle balloon captain named Garla , and her crew of hobgoblins , goblins, and smoke mephits .</p>
<p>Having learned of a group of Acquisitions Incorporated employees interfering with his ambitions, Splugoth arranged with Garla to intercept the group's battle balloon journey to the Greypeak Mountains with two of the Six's own battle balloons, one of them armed with a giant needle affixed to its prow.</p>
