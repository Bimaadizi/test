<p>Undead were creatures that had died and then been animated by spiritual or magical forces. Some deities employed undead as divine servants; for example, the dwarven god Dumathoin used undead dwarves as divine messengers. Among the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau , undead were known as the Headshrinker's children .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Undead were extremely resilient to a number of effects and substances that were extremely harmful to the living. They were immune to all mind-affecting effects, poison , sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease , and death effects. In addition, it was not possible to drain their life force in any manner.</p>
<h2>Origins</h2>
<p>There were six basic ways a living creature could become undead:</p>
<h2>Aquatic</h2>
<p>Aquatic undead or marine undead were a subtype of undead that were better adapted to bodies of water and often risen from the bodies of those who had died in water.</p>
<p>Aquatic undead in the Realms included aquatic remnants , drowned ones or "sea zombies", drowned dead , lacedons or "marine ghouls", the velya strain of vampirism , and any aquatic animal risen from the dead, such as sharks . There also existed a special shark form of monster zombie known as death sharks . And though rare, there were aquatic variants of undead normally found on land, such as spectres , wights , and wraiths .</p>
<p>Some specialty priests of ocean deities in the Realms were granted a limited version of turn undead that could only affect aquatic undead. These included the Anchors of the Church of Umberlee and the Aquarians of the Church of Deep Sashelas . Though all manner of aquatic undead were also considered servants of the goddess Umberlee , who granted her priests the ability to call them up from the sea or create them in order to defend their temples or fight for them.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , major populations of aquatic undead on Toril could be found in the Sea of Swords , where a horde subservient to the Myrkulyte temple Legacy of Deep Death terrorized those above and below the sea and death sharks terrorized the Sword Coast , and in the Sea of Fallen Stars where the remnants of Iakhovas 's undead army continued to linger following his defeat in the Twelfth Ser√¥s War .</p>
<h2>Psionic</h2>
<p>Undead had a unique relationship with psionics . While they themselves were immune to mind-affecting powers or effects and mindfeeder weapons, effectively rendering half of a psionics user's arsenal null (especially that of a telepath ), so long as they had sufficient sentience to create a reserve of mental energy the undead had the capacity to wield psionic powers, including mind-affecting powers. Referred to as psionic undead , this rare subtype could arise from most forms of undead, such as skeleton warriors . Some psionic undead were creatures who had such powers innately in life, such as alhoons and vampiric mind flayers . Others were uniquely known for being psionic regardless of what the creature had been in life, such as the brain in a jar , caller in darkness , and psionic ashenwight .</p>
<p>Psionic undead were vulnerable to most of the same non-mind affecting powers or effects that specifically affected psionic creatures , though there existed some powers that could specifically target them. Detonate , which allowed a manifester to explode the body of a mindless corporeal undead (though not free-willed undead), and sever the tie , which could disrupt an undead's tie to the Negative Energy plane through psionic manipulation of planar conduits.</p>
