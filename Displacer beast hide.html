<p>Displacer beast hide was a variety of makeshift cloaks that were just hides of displacer beasts that still retained some of the beast's innate magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Creation of displacer beast hide required nothing but a skilled hand and a skinning knife . Pelts of the beasts retained limited amounts of magic, distorting and wrapping light that touched them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once activated, a displacer beast hide released the effects similar to those of the displacement spell , making the wearer that much harder to pinpoint in place and harm in battle. This magical property could be activated once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , once such a hide belonged to Mintassan , the Sage of Westgate , and was available for purchase from the wizard 's curio shop, Mintassan's Mysteris .</p>
