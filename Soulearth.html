<p>Soulearth was the cavernous divine realm of Urogalan , the halfling deity of elemental earth and death.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology , this realm was located underground on Eronia , the rugged and mountainous second layer of the plane known as Elysium . In the World Tree cosmology it was also underground, but situated beneath the Green Fields , which in that cosmology was the collective celestial plane of the Halfling pantheon .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Unlike the divine realms of the Halfling pantheon's other members, Soulearth lacked petitioners of its own. Rather, the only creatures one could find there were the spirits of halflings, which typically came to Soulearth upon their death and waited for Urogalan to assign them their proper place in the afterlife.</p>
