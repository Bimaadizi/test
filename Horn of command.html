<p>A horn of command was an enchanted musical instrument that amplified the user's voice.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The magic of a horn of command allowed the user to be heard at distances three times greater than normal. However, once per day the horn could be used to issue a suggestion to anyone within 60 feet (18 meters) provided they spoke the same language as the wielder. The horn could also be targeted to a single individual. Doing this made it much harder for the target to resist the horn's magic.</p>
