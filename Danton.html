<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Danton was a refined druid who attempted to escape approaching cultists of the Absolute whist in the shape of one of the peacocks he cared for. This attempt was in vain and ended in Danton's demise in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Shortly after, he ended up among the dozen individuals plucked from the Fugue Plane , chosen by the entity Withers to aid in his campaign against the Dead Three . Like other "hirelings," Danton forgot his living tongue and could only communicate through Withers' words.</p>
