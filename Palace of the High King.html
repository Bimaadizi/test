<p>The Palace of the High King , also known as Caer Callidyrr , was a wondrous structure located in the city of Caer Callidyrr on Alaron within the Moonshae Isles . It was the tallest man-made structure in the Moonshaes.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The splendorous castle was spread over three hilltops and was bigger in size than some towns. Its tall walls of alabaster and white granite were polished to shine and glimmer in the sunlight. The walls were topped with crenellated battlements and several drawbridges allowed access into the castle past guarded high gatehouses. Its spires, decorated with streaming pennants, were seen from across the entirety of the city, projecting elongated needle-like shadows down on the town and often stood above the clouds, making them easily visible for ships approaching Whitefish Bay .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>This castle was the seat of power for the High Kings and Queens of House Kendrick . The council of mages who served the monarch lived within the castle. It also served as the base of operations for the monarch's elite knights, known as the Callidyrr dragoons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The palace had been built in ancient times by Cymrych Hugh , the first High King of the Moonshaes, and served as the seat of power for the Cymrych Dynasty of High Kings as well as their lesser successors, the Carrathal Dynasty of Callidyrr .</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , the castle provided a constant reminder of the peak to which Ffolk civilization had once ascended.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<h3>High Kings and Queens</h3>
<p>The last High King (in name only) of the Carrathal Dynasty was Reginald Carrathal , who died in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR . He was succeeded by Tristan Kendrick , who became the first true High King of the Ffolk in centuries upon his coronation.</p>
<p>High King Tristan was succeeded by his daughter, High Queen Alicia , in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , who ruled until the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR .</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the High King was Derid Kendrick , who remained on the throne through at least the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR .</p>
<h3>Council of Mages</h3>
<p>The castle was one of the rare places in the Moonshaes in which arcane spellcasters were often encountered. A council of thirteen powerful sorcerers and wizards operated from the castle, and while their role was to serve the High Kings and Queens, they were known to be mostly autonomous. Prior to the rise of Tristan Kendrick, these mages were known to exert direct control over small parts of Callidyrr. Members of the council maintained apprentices and other students, numbering at least 50 spellcasters in total.</p>
