<p>Slick Inatra was a half-elven agent of the Zhentarim in the city of Baldur's Gate in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Inatra was a bronze-skilled halfâ€“ high elf with blonde hair and brown eyes. She wore leather armor and wielded a long bow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Slick Inatra worked under ranking Zhents Roah Moonglow and Friol , forging sticky alliances with the Guild and the Cult of the Absolute alike. The Guild began suffering losses at the hands of the Stone Lord , so Nine-Fingers Keene rolled dice and hired Zhentarim agents as muscle. Slick Inatra was among the Zhents stationed within the Guild's Guildhall in the city's Undercellar . Nine-Fingers Keene, however, did not know that Roah and Friol planned a betrayal. Taking out the Guild meant establishing a Zhentish presence in Baldur's Gate. With the city shuddering under the cult's attack, the struggle's outcome and Inatra's fate remained unrecorded.</p>
