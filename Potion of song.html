<p>A potion of song was a potion that gave its drinker incredible singing abilities.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>By consuming this potent potion, an individual could produce a stunning singing voice, regardless of any impediments such as being gagged, affected by magical silence, or having lost their vocal cords or tongue due to injury or natural form. The imbiber had complete control over the pitch and timbre of their voice, ranging from a high, ethereal soprano to a deep, resonating bass, which could be adjusted at will for the duration of the potion's magic.</p>
<p>Upon consuming the potion, the individual became impervious to all sound-based assaults, including the banshee 's piercing wail, the entrancing song of a harpy , and the deafening roar of a sphinx . Moreover, the potion also bestowed upon the imbiber the ability to flawlessly replicate the vocal tone of any creature whose voice they had previously heard.</p>
<p>The individual's voice could be projected across distances of up to 0.5 mi (0.8 km), filling vast halls or other large chambers with ease, and even penetrating through the deafening clamor of howling winds or the cacophony of battle. With some experimentation, the singer could learn to modify their potion-enhanced song.</p>
<p>The potion also allowed the individual to convey messages through their song lyrics and captivated the attention of all sentient beings. Even an inexperienced singer could expect to earn a considerable sum of money in a marketplace or tavern by delivering a remarkably emotional or unforgettable performance.</p>
