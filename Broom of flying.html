<p>The broom of flying was an enchanted broom that allowed its owner to fly.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The broom of flying could fly for up to 9 hours every day. Some brooms could fly at a speed of 30 feet (9.1 meters), carrying a load of 182 pounds (82.6 kilograms) without slowing down, but with any more weight it would slow at a rate of 1 foot (0.3 meters) for every 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) added. Other brooms were able to fly at a faster rate of 40 feet (12 meters) or even 50 feet (15 meters), if the weight was under 200 pounds (91 kilograms) and would slow down to 30 feet (9.1 meters) when above that weight and were able to move at this speed up until 400 pounds (180 kilograms) when it could no longer fly at all. All brooms could climb or descend at a rather steep rate of 30 degrees.</p>
<p>Every broom had a command word . If the command word was spoken and a known location, including layout, was used it would fly to that place. Otherwise, it would fly to its owner if they were up to 300 feet (91 meters) from the broom. A broom that could not be sent to other locations could instead be called from as far away as 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) instead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Mornhaven Towers deep in the Mere of Dead Men a broom of flying lay hidden within a linen closet, with its command word etched into the handle.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To create a broom of flying , a grand sum of 17,000 gp of ingredients was needed, this often including roc feathers. The maker would need to able to create wondrous items and wield magic of some sort, as the spells overland flight and permanency were used in the creation.</p>
