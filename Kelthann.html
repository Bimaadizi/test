<p>Kelthann was an island in the Pirate Isles .</p>
<p>It had few true pirates, owing to its close proximity to Sembia , but it acted as a smuggling port, where goods could be transferred freely between parties without regulation or taxation. The human and halfling natives here worshiped Grumbar .</p>
