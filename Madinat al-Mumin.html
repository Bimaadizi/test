<p>Madinat al-Mumin , or The City of the Faithful , was a small settlement located on the Steaming Isles within the Crowded Sea of southern Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Each and every one of the inhabitants of this town lived for the Law of the Loregiver , firmly believing that as long as the Law was practiced within Madinat al-Mumin, that it would never cease to exist regardless of what happened to the rest of the Land of Fate</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A militia of 28 individuals could be assembled if needed, but the citizens of Madinat al-Mumin were peaceful, learned folk who could call upon Fate to aid them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Madinat al-Mumin gleamed like a wealthy city of a larger size. All of the buildings were white-washed, and many possessed fabulous architecture. The town boasted a grand palace that seemed out of place for such a small settlement.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Madinat al-Mumin was founded by Jamila the Virtuous and her husband. Together they discovered the descendants of Nog and Kadar and guided them to Enlightenment .</p>
