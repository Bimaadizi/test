<p>Arauntril Scourged was an controversial, yet highly-sought-after book of erotic fiction in the Heartlands of the Realms .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Arauntril Scourged was the unauthorized sequel of the adventure story Arauntril: Lady Death, Lady Flame by Sarkoarvhan Dhurr . Moving away from the original's rollicking adventure-comedy, Scourged was intensely and unrelentingly pornographic on every page. In the midst of these highly novel and memorable sex scenes, it featured and made sharp social commentary of current rulers, realms, writers, and customs that the author found worthy of critique.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Arauntril Scourged was written by an anonymous author, working without the knowledge or approval of Sarkoarvhan Dhurr. The book had a limited run and was very hard to find, with the rare few held tightly by their owners. Though Dhurr was upset when he first heard of it, when he finally got a chance to read it he was quite delighted by the contents. The Sage Royal of Cormyr Lord Alaphondar commented that the depictions of people in the book were "wincingly accurate".</p>
