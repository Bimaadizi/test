Creatures that earned her favor might be rewarded with gems , or sometimes some other gift or favor. She represented a certain facet of Sardior's personality.</p>
<p>On worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Hrodel. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Hrodel was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted psions specializing in telepathy. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. There was also a library dedicated to Hrodel; its hallowed halls held much information on gem dragons, such as the Draconum Psionicus .</p>

<p>Hrodel served Sardior as his thane, alongside fellow thanes the amethyst dragon Aleithilithos , the emerald dragon Smargad , the sapphire dragon Charisma , the topaz dragon Tithonnas , and the destroyed obsidian dragon Seradess .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Toril time, scholars and followers of Sardior searched the library of Hrodel for lore on a unique three-headed gem dragon. They'd learned of after an expedition discovered the journal of a defender of Sardior, Theo Boranis, who'd been lost in a cave-in some three centuries prior. The dragon he'd seen slumbering was Blithen the Outcast, Sardior's banished advisor.</p>
