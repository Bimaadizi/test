<p>Gloves of missile snaring , also known as gloves of arrow snaring , were magical gloves that allowed their wearer to attenuate the impact of projectiles, or even to catch them mid-flight.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gloves of missile snaring were snug and seemed to meld with the hands of their wearer once put on, becoming almost invisible.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of a pair of gloves of missile snaring was empowered with quick reflexes to deflect projectiles from ranged weapons, such as arrows or darts , considerably reducing the damage dealt by them, or even negating it completely. In the latter case, the wearer could choose to grab projectiles mid-air , be it an arrow, a throwing axe , throwing dagger , a rock, or even a spear .</p>
<p>They were only effective if both gloves were worn and if the wearer had at least one free hand with which to catch the projectile.</p>
