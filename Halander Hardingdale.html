<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Born Halander Hardingdale, "Ratshadow" gained his moniker as a youth by "shadowing" the Rivington Rats gang. He made certain contacts within other gangs which brought down the wrath of the Rivington Rats. He evacuated his mother and sisters to Waterdeep where he later joined them. However before leaving his hideaway in the Undercellar of Baldur's Gate, he stole a magic pouch from the kingpin known as the Fetcher .</p>
<p>Reuniting his family in Waterdeep, Ratshadow joined the Zhentarim as a front man. They felt his skill at making contacts could be used elsewhere and sent him North to Ten Towns to help establish the Black Network as a regional power.</p>
<h3>Tyranny of Dragons</h3>
<p>In the 1480s DR , Ratshadow joined a group of adventurers in Icewind Dale on a mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon from retrieving an item they required to summon their Dragon Queen to the Realms, the Red Dragon Mask . He remained with the group for some time, accompanying them to the isle of Tuern and the city of Neverwinter in their ongoing pursuit of the cult. It was while in Neverwinter that Ratshadow saw his opportunity to give the Zhentarim an edge. As the cult's dragon allies descended upon Neverwinter, he stole the White Dragon Mask and stashed it away at the Ulbrinter Villa . Unfortunately for Lord Arthagast Ulbrinter , cult agents broke into the noble manor, and eventually killed the nobleman.</p>
