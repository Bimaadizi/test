<p>Toron was a tiefling from Elturel that was forced from his home city along with others of his kind in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He spent his time tending the oxen that accompanied his fellow Elturian tieflings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Elturel was briefly pulled down to the Nine Hells in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , and subsequently returned to Faer√ªn , all the tieflings in the city were exiled from its borders. Toron joined a group led by Zevlor and traveled with them west to Baldur's Gate , before being forced to find refuge at the Emerald Grove druidic enclave due to increased goblin attacks.</p>
<p>The compounded instances of bad fortune gave Toron much anxiety and left him feeling as if his fellow tieflings had no good course of action.</p>
