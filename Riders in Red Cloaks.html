<p>The Riders in Red Cloaks were the mounted defenders of the market-town of Asbravn , in the southern Sunset Vale during the midâ€“14 th century DR . Comprising local volunteer townfolk, along with a few seasoned warriors and wizards , they were sponsored by Iriaebor to patrol the roads of the Dusk Road and Uldoon Trail and keep them safe.</p>
<p>Asbravn and the Red Cloaks were synonymous with one another, as almost every family in town counted at least one relative within their ranks.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Red Cloaks often faced orcs , bugbears , trolls , and other monstrous humanoids that roamed between the Reaching Woods and Sunset Mountains .</p>
<p>They received 10 gp per week in pay, and were allowed to keep the loot in battle they pooled together.</p>
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>The Riders were armed with longswords and spears and wore chainmail , or plate mail in the case of the officers. Of course they all wore red cloaks, from which their organization drew its name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Ches of 1357 DR , a horrifying creature "with many heads all like snakes" attacked a couple of farms north of Asbravn. The leader of the Riders in Red Cloaks reached out for aid in slaying this monster and even sent a carrier pigeon to Lord Piergeiron of Waterdeep for aid.</p>
<p>Around the year 1366 DR , a number of protectors of Asbravn were reportedly poisoned . To add to these heinous attacks, the group had been repeatedly ambushed by a number of well-paid mercenary companies. The Zhentarim were suspected to be responsible for these crimes.</p>
