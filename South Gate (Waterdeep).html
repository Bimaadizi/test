<p>The South Gate was the southern point of entrance through the Trollwall into Waterdeep , City of Splendors.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The gate featured a single tower on either side of the High Road . Each tower stood four stories tall.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The South Gate was found in southern Waterdeep where the Dock Ward and Southern Ward met.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>Any large caravan that wished to enter through South Gate had to register with one of the Magisters of Waterdeep , who was always accompanied by members of the City Guard . Small parties and individuals only had to register with one if their stay extended beyond a tenday . In both cases, discovery of a failure to do so would result in either a fine or being put to forced labor.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Access to the South Gate from outside of the city was only possible through Southfort Keep , situated a short way to the southeast.</p>
<p>Prior to the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , as a defensive measure one of the Walking Statues of Waterdeep were stationed beneath the South Gate and hidden away on the Ethereal plane . It actively defended against ethereal intrusion, attacking any ethereal creatures it perceived within Waterdeep's bounds, but would ignore ethereal humanoids unless there was a group of ten or more of them. In 1385 DR, it and six of the other hidden Walking Statues exited the Ethereal plane and left their positions to rampage across the city.</p>
