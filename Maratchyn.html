<h2>Appearance</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late 1357 DR , Maratchyn witnessed Laeral's strength failing; she nearly fainted, and he held her. Then, as she ordered the apprentices to remove all magic items from the room in the tower where they were, he witnessed the phantom silhouette of Alustriel speak to her about Shandril Shessair 's spellfire going out of control, and discussing their preparations. Laeral teleported away shortly after, and Khelben turned up, demanding to know what had transpired. He was not satisfied by Maratchyn's account of events, and proposed to review his memories directly, which Maratchyn didn't argue against.</p>
