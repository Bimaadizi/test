<p>Urgund was a man who was once held captive in the lower planes . He wrote of his experience in Urgund's Description of Darkness , some time before the midâ€“14 th century DR . Although it was a grim work, it was not much more than a listing of names and palaces, for the horrors within them were too horrible to set down on paper .</p>
