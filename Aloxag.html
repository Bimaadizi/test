<p>Aloxag was the trusted bodyguard spectator who served Ibbalar Thrul in his Undermountain lair in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Ibbalar Thrul constructed a magical apparatus that was powered by a rare enchanted Kossuth ruby . Using the magical portal pool, Ibbalar called forth a small army of spectators and sent them into Waterdeep to "guard" powerful magical items, such as Piergeiron the Paladinson 's enchanted sword. The floating aberrations created chaos in the city, and Khelben Arunsun sent his trusted agent into the mega-dungeon underneath the Yawning Portal to find and stop the nuisance invasion. That Khelbenite managed to infiltrate the mad wizard 's lair and confronted what he thought to be Ibbalar Thrul himself. In reality, Aloxag took the wizard's place, allowing him to escape the punishment from the Lords of Waterdeep . Aloxag was slain in the process.</p>
