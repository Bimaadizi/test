<p>Some time round the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the beach was again overrun with the activity of ne'er-do-wells associated with the Blackdaggers. The culprits then were the Blackdagger bandits led by the vicious Jareth Grim , who led the groups raids on behalf of the undead Traven Blackdagger, who had been risen as a skeletal pirate captain by the Red Wizard Kallos Tam .</p>
<p>Also around that time, Marion Hexbane set up operations within the sea caves set into beach's cliff face.</p>
