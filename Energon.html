<p>Energons were a classification of spherical outsiders native to the Energy Planes . Energons from the Positive Energy Plane were known as xag-ya while those from the Negative Energy Plane were known as xeg-yi . While similar, these two subspecies were sometimes described as reverse images of each other.</p>
<p>Energons were said to be the closest analogs to " elementals " of the Positive and Negative Energy planes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Energons were incorporeal concentrations of energy inhabited by mysterious intelligences. They appeared as faintly glowing, translucent spheres approximately 2​ to ​4 feet (0.61​ to ​1.2 meters) in diameter, with six to twelve tentacles radiating from them. A pair of narrow spots on the upper part of the sphere appeared to serve as their eyes. The colorations and energy emanations differed between xag-ya and xeg-yi, with the former being warmer, brighter, and suffused with positive energy while the latter were cooler, duller, and suffused with negative energy .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Energons were largely docile and highly intelligent, having unknowable and alien minds. They did not speak or otherwise appear to be able to communicate—either among themselves or with others—however they would take notice of other creatures and often appeared to observe them. They seemed to be especially drawn to places in which births or deaths were occurring. As incorporeal creatures, they did not heed any physical barriers.</p>
<p>In cases wherein a xag-ya and a xag-yi became aware of each other, both would race toward the other: if they collided, both were annihilated in a forceful, 60‑foot-wide (18‑meter) explosion that had the peculiar property of randomly heating and/or corroding non-living matter within the blast radius. It was unclear whether this self-destructive behavior was driven by a mutual hatred or otherwise by some mutual desire to connect.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Merely touching an energon resulted in a jolt of positive energy (in the case of xag-ya) or negative energy (in the case of xeg-yi). In battle, energons made use of their incorporeality to move about the battlefield, outflank their foes, and take cover inside solid objects. They would position themselves so as to limit enemy mobility with the threat of surprise attacks, which often came in the form of lashes of their tentacles carrying dangerous energy.</p>
<p>If slain, an energon exploded in a burst of energy 20​ to ​40 feet (6.1​ to ​12 meters) wide, however they could only be injured by other incorporeal creatures or by magical weapons. They were also known to be immune to a wide range of spells : the only magics that could reliably be used to fight both kinds of energons included magic missile and disintegrate for offense as well as shield and circle of protection for defense. Both could also be sent back to their native planes using abjure , banishment , dismissal , dispel magic , holy word / unholy word , plane shift , and/or wish (or limited wish ).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Energons were prone to travel and explore, and could be found just about anywhere across the planes . Outside of their native Energy Planes, they could be encountered most notably in the Ethereal plane , the Astral Plane , and the Plane of Shadow . They almost always travelled alone, although clusters of up to eight individuals had been observed. Energons were rarely hostile, but because the energies which comprised their bodies were inherently dangerous, it was not uncommon for other creatures to regard them as threats.</p>
<p>Energons fed on energy, including the energy of emotions, although their actual feeding habits were a mystery. Likewise, nothing was known about how they reproduced, although it was assumed that they were asexual owing to how rarely they interacted with others of their own kind.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Clerics and necromancers were known to capture energons to make use of their innate energies, such as to empower rituals or minions or simply to serve as guardians. An energon could be summoned and bound to an object, in which case any damage to that object would cause the energon to manifest and attack anyone nearby. Imprisoned energons could become unnerving swirls of emotion, but they would readily ally themselves with someone who rescued them from such captivity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was unclear whether xag-ya and xeg-yi had originated independently on their respective Energy Planes, or if the two kinds of energons instead had a common origin (or perhaps had even been created intentionally).</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , energons could be encountered in the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
<p>During the late 15 th century DR, the Red Wizards of Thay experimented with controlling energons, and trained them to transform their enemies' emotions into an energy source.</p>
