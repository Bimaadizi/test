<p>Zazefay Logging and Mining was an Amnian trading company that operated in Amn's colony at Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The company was principlally interested in extracting Chult's abundant natural resources for export. It traded in rare Chultan wood and minerals valued by Faerûnian crafters, and specialized in felling the tallest and mightiest jungle trees.</p>
<p>As an Amnian trading company in Port Nyanzaru, Zazefay Logging and Mining wielded a great deal of influence in the city and was in constant political and financial competition with the other trade companies. Affiliation with the company granted the right to reside within the safety of Port Nyanzaru's wall.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zazefay's logging business brought them into direct competition with Baldur's Gate 's logging interests out of Fort Beluarian . They were well known as rivals among the trade guilds of Baldur's Gate, notably the Unicorns .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Zazefay's participated in sponsoring a great hunt that served as a competition between Port Nyanzaru's dozens of trading companies. They vied against the other companies—notably Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters , House Selemchant , Naelishti's Naturals , and the Order of Belox —to recruit the most capable hunters.</p>
<p>Amnian companies like Zazefay's were subsequently expelled from Port Nyanzaru by the Ytepka Society and a local merchant consortium in the late 15 th century DR, and were replaced by seven merchant princes as the city's mercantile and political leaders. Zazefay's trade in trees was taken over by the prince Jessamine , while the trade in precious minerals came to be controlled by Zhanthi .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The company's employees spent much of their time in the jungle, making them much more knowledgeable about Chultan fauna than most other Amnians in Port Nyanzaru.</p>
<p>The owner was a gnome merchant named Zazefay .</p>
