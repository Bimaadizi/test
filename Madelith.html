<p>Madelith was a succubus from the Nine Hells who was searching for the Infernal Stone in Luskan in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1490 DR , Madelith was pursued by the Order of the Burning Dawn after they were made aware of the fiend by Bryn Lightfingers . Bryn used to belong to a band of rangers in Ardeep Forest that had guarded the Infernal Stone, until the ranger's leader, Corissa Windroot , was seduced and killed by Madelith. However, Corissa had taken the advice of Bryn and hidden away the stone before her death.</p>
<p>In Luskan, Madelith seduced Thesian and ordered him to procure the Infernal Stone for her. It was recovered by a band of mercenaries led by Kevros and delivered to Thesian and Madelith shortly before they were confronted by the Champion of the Burning Dawn .</p>
