<p>A wand of fear was a magical wand that caused creatures to grovel and cower in terror or outright flee from its wielder. While they struck fear in the hearts of many, the bravest and most stout of heart were able to resist its effects.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many of these wands were crafted with small fragments or pieces of bone. For many years, the common-folk of Faerûn believed that an arm of a lich was required in their creation, however this was dubbed as ridiculous by those who were knowledgeable on the matter.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A wand of fear crafted prior to the Spellplague mimicked the effects of the spell after which it was named.</p>
<p>Following the Second Sundering of 1487 DR , a wand of fear possessed seven charges upon its creation. A number of these charges were replenished every morning at dawn. If it was ever depleted, there was a small chance the wand crumbled to ash.</p>
<p>If the wielder expended one of these charges they caused a person or creature to tremble with fright as if they were commanded to do so. If two charges were spent in this manner, the wand emitted a 60‑foot (18‑meter) cone of amber-color light that sparked terror in the minds of any creatures within. Those affected would try and flee from the wielder and do anything in their power to avoid their presence. This latter effect lasted for a minute and could only be withstood by the most willful of beings.</p>
<p>These wands were even more potent when wielded by the dreadmasters of Bane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The green dragon Needle kept a wand of fear as part of her treasure trove.</p>
