<p>The Branch of Linden was a human supremacist organization operating out of Tethyr in the late 1400s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>It was composed of supporters of Evonne Linden and her revolt against her half-sister Anais Rhindaun as queen of Tethyr. The Branch of Linden worked to overthrow the queen and install Evonne's daughter Ysabel Linden on the throne.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Children's Massacre in the 1469Â DR and the death of Evonne Linden, Anais's own grandfather Reinhold blamed Anais and created the Branch of Linden.</p>
<p>After several skirmishes between the queen's army and the Branch of Linden, with the last and worst on the Ebenspy Plateau , the rebels retreated into Ebenspy Keep . After several days of siege, half of them died with a coughing sickness and the queen's soldiers broke the siege and seized the castle, defeating the Branch of Linden. The leaders were hanged before the High Palace at Darromar .</p>
<p>After that, the Branch of Linden were believed to be wiped out. Yet the organization survived and was resurgent in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
