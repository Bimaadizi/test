<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original owner of the Belt of Bones was a dangerous warrior named Proud Keth who wore the belt into many battles, where the man massacred everyone in his way. Keth used the belt's magic on rare occasions when he was surrounded by enemies. Eventually, Proud Keth's enemies learned of his strategies and took him down once a for all using polearms and spears . The Belt of Bones was on Keth's body when the warrior was buried. However, how grave was soon desecrated and the magic belt – taken. The thieves ended up selling the Belt of Bones to the mage named Isanan from Urmlaspyr , a city in Sembia .
