<p>Tanarell was an aging paladin adventurer from Waterdeep , already retired by Kythorn 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his old age, Tanarell was a frail man who still carried himself with an unmistakable dignity of a paladin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Tanarell was aged beyond the capabilities of a warrior. His thin body could barely hold his heavy armor, and his achy arms could not swing a blade . When his home â€“ the City of Splendors, became once again endangered by the drow menace from the Undermountain , Tanarell volunteered to go on the expedition into the mega-dungeon to find the source of the attacks and assassinations. However, he was too old and was denied the descent by Durnan , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal . The elder paladin felt bitter and depressed about not being able to help, feeling useless in his old age, but nevertheless was more than happy to share his knowledge of Undermountain, accrued through the long adventuring long career.</p>
<p>Tanarell taught the younger heroes that Undermountain was never the same and ever-changing according to the demented whims of Halaster Blackcloak the Mad Mage. He knew the patterns of the ever-shifting dungeon and signet of its many traps and perils. Tanarell especially warned against trusting mirrors while underground.</p>
