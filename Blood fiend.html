<p>Blood fiends were abominations who fed on the blood of living creatures. Initially created in the Elemental Chaos by the ancient primordial , Haemnathuun , they were just as prevalent in other planes , wherever there were creatures to provide food for them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blood fiends were humanoid in form, with a purple-black or reddish scaly hide, a lupine muzzle with great fangs, red eyes, and four clawed hands. Each of these hands had five razor-sharp claws extending from them, as did the feet.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Blood fiends preyed on other fiends, as vampires preyed on humans. They also had the same ability to transform other creatures into their kind. In order to assist them in their hunts, blood fiends could use a terror gaze that immobilized their unfortunate victim, making the feast all the easier for the blood fiend. Blood fiends themselves were immune to fear.</p>
<p>Most wounds inflicted on them would heal in a matter of moments.</p>
