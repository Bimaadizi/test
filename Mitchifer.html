<p>Mitchifer was the proprietor and barkeep of the World Serpent Inn , a interplanar tavern and inn that could be accessed from the city of Arabel in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At first glance, Mitchifer appeared like a tall, overweight human with a long white beard and flushed cheeks. If one looked closely at Mitchifer's face, it could be seen that the strands of his beard were tiny white snakes rather than hair. Mitchifer had no irises, and his pupils were shaped like doorways.</p>
<p>It was said, however, that Mitchifer's appearance—as that of his inn—varied at different times and places, sometimes radically.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mitchifer was kind to everyone, treating all as friends that he had always known —even if they had treated him poorly in the past. His face seemed stuck in a permanent smile. He had a boisterous, loud laugh, and some—such as Volothamp Geddarm —reported being unable to refrain from laughing in his presence.</p>
<p>Mitchifer was happy to provide basic information about his inn or connect people of common interests, but he refused to talk about more complicated matters.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite his jovial appearance, Mitchifer had deific powers, which kept violence in his tavern at bay. He sometimes seemed able to control to which plane the inn would connect.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Mitchifer seemed to have any drink imaginable available at his bar.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mitchifer had a deal with Shult , the owner of the Wild Goose , an inn in Arabel that had a a dimensional connection to the World Serpent. Mitchifer provided Shult with exotic goods from across the Planes for his patrons.</p>
<p>Mitchifer had a superior known as "the Owner", who was said to be a god or even an overgod , who was a sleeping fragment of the World Serpent .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many believed that Mitchifer was a refugee from a cosmic faction. Elminster and others believed that Mitchifer was a god who enjoyed interacting with all manner of creatures and chose to become the barkeep of the World Serpent to control access in and out of varying planes. In any case, the Owner's consciousness controlled the demiplane in which the inn had been constructed, and Mitchifer acted as divine servant of that consciousness.</p>
<p>Some claimed that Mitchifer had died multiple times, but he always seemed to return.</p>
