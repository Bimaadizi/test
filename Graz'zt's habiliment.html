<p>Graz'zt's habiliment was a suit of magical leather armor provided by the demon lord Graz'zt during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The close-fitting leather armor left the legs and arms bare, composed simply of a jerkin , skirt , and sandals . It was comfortable to wear and pleasing (sultry, even) to look at.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The armor provided broad magical defenses against physical and magical threats, improved the wearer's vitality, and made it easier to dodge. It also made the wearer a touch narcissistic about their good looks, with a minor obsession with their own reflection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The outfit was granted by Graz'zt to an adventurer that foiled his plans in Tethyamar . Defeated in his schemes, he playfully withdrew and left them the habiliment as a reward for the good sport.</p>
