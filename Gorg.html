<p>Gorg was a hobgoblin prisoner at the Revel's End prison on the Frozenfar in the late 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing some 7 feet (2.1 meters), Gorg had pointed ears, jagged teeth, and long black hair, and was muscular and heavily scarred.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For unspecified crimes, Gorg was transported to the Revel's End prison on the coast of the Sea of Moving Ice . On the sleigh ride there, however, even whilst manacled hand and foot, he killed his fellow prisoner by twisting his neck, then alleged it had been a bumpy ride to the guards. Four had to escort him, including Lucas , and they shoved Gorg into a cell with Holga Kilgore and Edgin Darvis —despite it being only a two-person cell. But when he sleazed onto Holga and made a grab for her, she beat him up, breaking both his legs and knocking him out cold on the frozen waste bucket.</p>
