<p>The Sea of Azul was a large body of water by south Maztica .</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>The Sea of Azul was the sea that lay between the Far Payit peninsula and the eastern edge of the House of Tezca desert in south Maztica. In the very north, it bordered the nation of Pezelac as well. The southern portions of the sea bordered the jungles of the Green Folk , the Gulf of Qotal , and even Lopango . In the sea itself were the Brown Sisters (a chain of three islands) and the Coxamult Island .</p>
<p>The bay that the city Maxal and the Great Salt Marsh sat upon opened into the Sea of Azul, and people from Maxal would sometimes sail in massive canoes across the sea, to trade with the Green Folk that lived on the eastern coast.</p>
