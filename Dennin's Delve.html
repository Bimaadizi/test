<p>Dennin's Delve , also known as The Delve , was an ancient and ruined dwarven stronghold found on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Dennin's Delve was located under the Trollclaw Range in northwestern Moray. Tunnels beneath the ruin connected it to the Underdark beneath the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Little remained of the once-impressive original dwarven stonework as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<p>A secret portal was located deep within the ruins that connected Moray to another portal within the Fairheight Range on Alaron on the other side of the Moonshae Isles. It was sizable enough to allow for largescale movement of people and supplies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Hammer 1 of the Year of the Flaming Dwarf, 987 DR , a dwarven expedition departed from Dennin's Delve via the Underdark and headed west seeking a land beyond the horizon . This group would subsequently experience the Rockfire Disaster .</p>
<p>While once the pride of the dwarves of Moray, the stronghold was subsequently destroyed by orcs , trolls , and goblins during or following the events of the Spellplague .</p>
<p>As of the late 1470s DR, the Delve was occupied by Northlanders interested in reaping the natural resources of Moray. The Black Blood tribe drove out the Northlanders of Moray when an embodiment of Malar led them in battle, killing the men and driving the women and children into a trap at Caer Moray .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the portal in the depths of Dennin's Delve had long been deactivated, and had become part of the lair of a vicious beholder .</p>
