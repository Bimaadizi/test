<p>The Jotunslayers were a band of dwarven adventurers in the 14 th century DR who lived for battle and monster hunts.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Jotunslayers consisted exclusively of dwarves.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The members of the Jotunslayers could often be found in taverns, re-telling the awe-inspiring stories of their monster hunts, and developing new tactics and methods of bringing down monstrous prey.</p>
<p>Their main opponents were monstrosities , aberrations , and such. They were known to take up their axes against orcs and other hostile humanoids . Their passion, however, lay in battling strange creatures with tentacles and fearsome dragons.</p>
<p>The Jotunslayers often sold their services to parties interested in cleansing an area of nasty monster infestations and they offered escort through treacherous territories. As a rule of thumb, they declined guard services or ventures into the Underdark as they were too busy with other tasks. The common clients of the Jotunslayers were nobles, guilds, merchants, and other people and companies flush with coin.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The Jotunslayers were armed with axes, their favorite weapons. They also utilized more cunning tools in their hunts, such as bags of marbles, caltrops , tripwires, acid grenades, and others. They commonly wore baldrics and leather jerkins of many pockets , strapped overtop of their leather armor . Needless to say, they arrived prepared for battle in any scenario.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Jotunslayers made a name for themselves, literally, after one of their early exploits—ridding the land of numerous hill giants and fomorians in Everlund in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR . These dwarven adventurers harbored no special hatred towards the giant-kin however. Many new members of the Jotunslayers were the family and kin of established members. Most members of this ragtag group were dwarven outcasts and wanderers from various clans. The founding members were four female dwarf fighters and two male dwarf clerics of Marthammor Duin . By the late 15 th century DR, only two of the founders were still alive and active: a fighter named Shandrannon Ironshield and a cleric called Bruckhlar "Buckhard" Deepdelve .</p>
