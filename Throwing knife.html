<p>A throwing knife , or a throwing dagger , was a thrown weapon used throughout Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A throwing knife usually had a double-edged, pointed blade, as opposed to a typical knife, which only had a single edge and was a bit shorter. Unlike a dagger used for melee combat, throwing daggers often had a shorter handle, and were weighted much differently.</p>
<p>They could be found throughout Faerûn, on both the surface and in the Underdark . These weapons could be used in melee combat (although not their primary use), instead of a normal dagger, but were far less effective. [ speculation ]</p>
