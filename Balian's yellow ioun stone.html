<p>Balian's yellow ioun stone was a unique ioun stone that boosted a random physical or mental trait of the bearer.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When attuned, this seemingly faulty ioun stone gave an enhancement to one physical or mental trait of the bearer, as with ioun stones , but this was decided each day randomly. The stone could only be attuned once a day, and only functioned for twelve hours, after which it dropped to the floor. It couldn't be used again until twelve hours after it was last used.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Whilst serving as a guard at a convention of wizards , one Balian Rocksmith discovered this ioun stone on the floor, apparently lost after it stopped functioning.</p>
