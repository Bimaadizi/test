<p>Silverscales was a neighborhood of Ravens Bluff , located in the Harbor District on the west side of the city wall. The various seaside businesses, taverns and inns were tucked away in narrow alleys and under staircases, built on the mudflats along the coast of the Dragon Reach . It was a rough-and-tumble, seedy region of the city dominated by the scent of sea water and not-so-fresh fish.</p>
