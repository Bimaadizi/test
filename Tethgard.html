<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The watching spirit of Lady Duskreene , former ruler of Tethgard, resided there. She was an ancestor of Mirt .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tethgard predated the realm of Cormyr .</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR , stories circulated in Cormyr of the ruins of legendary Tethgard, hidden in the depths of the Hullack Forest. These became a draw for adventurers operating out of Thunderstone .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the ruins of Tethgard were the site of a bloody battle as, after failing to take Elminster , Storm Silverhand , and the Simbul into custody, a group of War Wizards and Purple Dragons unleashed their magics on the trio. Defending the three of them with a spell-shield that rebounded his opponents' spells back at them, Elminster slew or maimed much of the group. The rest retreated.</p>
