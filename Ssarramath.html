<p>Ssarramath were prayer foci of Sseth , the World Serpent, that adorned the homes of yuan-ti followers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ssarramath came in a variety of shapes and sizes. They could be as simple as a snake -headed coil scratched onto a wall or as elaborate as life-sized carvings of a serpent. These statues were coiled in a similar intertwined manner to a caduceus . Each yuan-ti home held at least one ssarramath. Ssarramath statues were placed in carved bowls filled with lit scented oils and bodies of creatures sacrificed to venerate Sseth, the World Serpent.</p>
