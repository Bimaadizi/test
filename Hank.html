<p>Hank , or the Ranger , was a ranger and an adventurer from Earth and the Realm ( no relation ). He was a companion of the monk Diana , the barbarian Bobby , the fighter Eric , the wizard Presto , and the rogue Sheila .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hank was reliable and had good self-discipline. Being the oldest member of the band, he naturally took a leadership role because his friends respected his judgment, without him being bossy or arrogant. He feared that if he lost their respect, he would lose their friendship too.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Hank fought with an energy bow that fired bolts of energy and a masterwork longsword , and wore +3 studded leather armor , an amulet of natural armor +1 , lesser bracers of archery , and a ring of protection +1 . He also had a waterskin , trail rations for a day, flint and steel, and three torches .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A talented ranger and archer, Hank could shoot at close range, in rapid succession, or multiple arrows at a time. He had a high constitution.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hank and his friends were originally from Earth, where they were in something called "the ninth grade". But they became trapped in the Realm and later in some place they called "the Forgotten Realms", evidently not knowing the difference. [ speculation ] Aided by a mysterious entity known as the Dungeon Master , they battled monsters sent at them by the villainous Venger and tried to defeat him for good while struggling to find a way home.</p>
<h3>The Victims of Tiamat</h3>
<p>Living long before the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , he was among a band of young adventurers who were all trying to find a way back to their distant home. However, it was said they were all slain horribly by Tiamat , together with their miniature unicorn. By 1369 DR , the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla , Amn , displayed paintings of Hank and Bobby.</p>
<h3>The Grand Tour of the Realms</h3>
<p>In the 1360s DR, Hank and his friends journeyed to the town of Shadowdale in Faerûn so that Presto could ask the great sage Elminster to take him on as an apprentice. While drinking in the Old Skull Inn , they spotted Elminster arrive. Though Presto had lost his nerve, Hank stood beside him to declare his friend's suitability.</p>
<p>Thus, Elminster whisked Presto away on a whirlwind tour of the Realms, and he came back traumatized and beaten and decided it best not to be his apprentice. Nevertheless, Presto had ideas for future adventures with his friends.</p>
<p>At this time, now in middle age, the ranger looked somewhat different. His hair was more ginger than blonde, and he wore a studded light-blue mantle, instead of his typical studded leather armor . He appeared to enjoy drinking ale .</p>
<h3>The High Sun Games</h3>
<p>In the late 1490s DR, Hank and his friends, all adults now and without unicorn, were one of six teams competing in the High Sun Games in the newly built arena in Neverwinter . They evaded the displacer beast and even got to the center of the maze and safely inside the sanctuary cage at the end, winning that round. However, the Red Wizard of Thay Sofina used the horn of beckoning death above the arena soon after, so their fate is unknown.</p>
<h3>Went to Waterdeep</h3>
<p>Aged only 15, Hank and friends were camping in a forest one night when the Dungeon Master arrived to check on them, soon abandoning them again with promises of finding snacks, such as the spicy fried potatoes they liked. Hank grew annoyed at this and their lack of progress on getting back to Earth; he had a new plan, but the others were tired and were accepting their new life. But then driders and darkmantles ambushed them, and they fought their way out and into a mysterious portal that opened. It dumped them from a height into the streets of Waterdeep , now in daytime and autumn. They were met by a girl who was pleased her spell had worked.</p>
