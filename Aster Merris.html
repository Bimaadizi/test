<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Forgotten Lords were already an influential mercantile group that spread its dealings across the Sword Coast. After the Shadow War finished, the trade and economy were left crippled in the area surrounding Neverwinter . The Forgotten Lords were among three major trade cartels granted offices within the Temple of Waukeen in the city's Tyr's Eye district. The Church of Waukeen guided the revival of trade and refilling of its drained coffers of the northern city with the blessing of Lord Nasher Alagondar . Aster Merris, the Forgotten Lords' regional leader, was reassigned from the headquarters in Waterdeep to Neverwinter to supervise the newly established business.</p>
<p>During that period of time, a new coster joined the economy of the north. Sa'Sani led her Mercantile House to the Sword Coast and opened its headquarters in the Crossroad Keep . Two of her associates did business in Neverwinter, including interactions with the Forgotten Lords. Il'foss and Kizu disappeared soon after, secretly slain by the yuan-ti Forktongue cultists of an interloper deity, Zehir . Sa'Sani's hirelings interviewed Aster regarding the missing merchants and were given an opportunity to ally the Mercantile House with the Forgotten Lords.</p>
