<p>Sussurs were a rare and magical species of tree native to the Underdark , found only in the largest of caverns and often in ones where wizard fire was present.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On average these trees grew to a height of 60 feet (18 meters). They had long and gnarled branches that sprouted sparse amounts of leaves. Their roots were aerial, similar to those of a banyan . Sussur plant flowers were large bright blue blossoms that exuded honey -sweet scent. When the flowers were harvested and exposed to sunlight, the aroma eventually turned rancid and then disappeared.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Sussurs thrived almost entirely on faerzress and other ambient magic in their environment. Because of their appetite for magic, antimagic fields spanning 100 feet (30 meters) often surrounded them.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>One particular area in the Underdark where sussurs could be found was the vault of Nuur Throth on the western edge of the northern Lowerdark . There circular groves of them surrounded pockmarked stones covering deep, black wells.</p>
<p>Another remarkable specimen grew near the myconid circle known as the Ebonlake Grotto .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mystran cleric Lenore De Hurst embarked on significant research on sussur trees, specifically the properties of their bark and flowers, in the late 1470s DR . She had even planted a sussur sapling in a small garden near the Arcane Tower .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Sussur were used to produce a rare type of paper . Sussur tree bark possessed potent magical properties. If it was burned in a blacksmith's forge, the bark turned its flames blue and could imbue a single weapon with enchantments .</p>
