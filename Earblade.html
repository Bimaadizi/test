<p>Earblades were a rogue 's last chance to beat the noose.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>By far, hanging was the most popular method for the execution of criminals. With an earblade attached, a guilty thief had a small chance to cut or weaken the rope tied around his neck, allowing for a slim chance of escape. One earblade was typically worn on each ear since the rope would be placed on either side of the thieves' neck.</p>
<p>Aurora's Emporium offered a money-back guarantee to any thief not completely satisfied with the performance of this product.</p>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>A single earblade cost 1 silver piece , but most smart thieves purchased one for each ear.</p>
