<p>Thisobald Thorm was a brewer who lived in the town of Reithwin in the shadow-cursed lands during the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like his relatives Gerringothe Thorm and Malus Thorm , he was affected by the shadow curse that plagued the land, which transformed him into an undead creature and warped his mind and body. In his cursed state, he remained cheerful and gregarious, eager to hear any stories brought by visitors to his tavern, though he was quick to turn violent if the stories bored him or if he discovered he had been lied to.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his shadow-cursed undead form, Thisobald's body was grossly obese with gray, decayed-looking flesh. He had four short legs and a tail, granting him a centaur-like appearance; it is unknown if he was a normal humanoid elf before becoming cursed.</p>
