<p>Patch was the pet dog that belonged to one of the Crivens family members inhabiting the town of Reithwin , sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Patch perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , and before it was consumed by the Shadow-cursed Lands . The event took the lives of almost every member of the Crivens clan, including Patch. The family was outlived only by Errick Crivens , who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Patch was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the House of Healing in a cluster surrounded by the graves of the family. The dog's tombstone read: "Here rests Patch, loyal dog of the Crivens family, taken along with his master. Good boy." The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
