<p>Rathloff was a sage from Ramekho , one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond , and later the mad leader of the Sons of Winter that operated out of Fimbrul in 1480 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In 1480 DR, Rathloff had white hair.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before 1479 DR , Rathloff was a prolific scholar. He was one of the few individuals who knew about the Cult of Reborn Flame , and actively opposed them.</p>
<p>In 1480 DR, he was corrupted by the evil magic used by Pyrultimus , and soon Rathloff became obsessed with freeing the primordial Cirotralech from his ancient prison.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His spellbook was a moldering tome of the north wind .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his youth, Rathloff was a sailor. When he went to Tarmalune during his travels, he met Halagothra and both fell in love. They married soon after. However, when she bore him a son, Halagothra left and he never saw her again. When his son died of plague in 1471 DR , Rathloff took care of his granddaughter, Glindarra .</p>
<p>In 1479 DR, Rathloff helped a band of adventurers that were investigating the activities of the Cult of Reborn Flame in Ramekho. However, he was later kidnapped and forced to help Pyrultimus in his research. Pyrultimus threatened him with killing Glindarra if he refused, and Rathloff had no other option but to help him. However, Rathloff was corrupted by the foul magic used in the ritual and soon after lost his sanity.</p>
<p>Rathloff became obsessed with the primordial Cirotralech and his consort, the titaness known as the Bride . He took leadership of a primordial cult known as the Sons of Winter , and went to Fimbrul to use Pyrultimus' ritual to awaken Cirotralech and the Bride.</p>
<p>The adventurers, who considered him their friend, went after him to try to stop him, but arrived too late, witnessing the awakening of the Bride. Seeing their old friend was beyond redemption, they had no other option but to kill him before he could awaken Cirotralech. However, there is the possibility that Rathloff had succeeded in his endeavor before he died.</p>
