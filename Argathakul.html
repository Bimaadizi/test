<p>Argathakul was a red dragon who laired on Harvestshield Mountain as of the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was relatively young in dragon terms as of the late 15 th century DR, but would display the cruelty of a dragon twice his age. He was prone to wander away from his territory, yet was willing to go to great lengths to defend that territory. However, he was not above fleeing a battle to save himself.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Argathakul laid claim to Harvestshield Mountain, but generally stayed out of sight unless he believed that his authority was being questioned. His lair sat at the summit of the mountain, and from it seeped sulfuric runoff that poisoned much of the water and plants of the mountain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Argathakul famously wreaked havoc on the Harvestsheild Mountain region sometime between the late 8 th and early 15 th century DR, thus ending its long years of agricultural prosperity. He then reemerged in the late 15 th century DR after Mrolgyet's Legion had claimed Chauntea's Citadel atop the mountain, and inserted himself into the middle of a battle between the Legion and the Lords' Alliance in order to assert his claim over the mountain. He was driven off by a group of adventurers in the service of Laeral Silverhand , the Open Lord of Waterdeep .</p>
