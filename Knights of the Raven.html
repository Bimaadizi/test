<p>The Knights of the Raven , also known as the Order of the Ravens or the Raven Knights , was the most prestigious and elite knighthood in the city of Ravens Bluff , the highest order a knight could strive for.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Knights of the Raven, like all knightly orders of Ravens Bluff, were overseen by a civic body called the Knights Council .</p>
<p>Unlike other knightly orders, a Ravenaar knight could not squire for the Raven Knights. Candidates for the high honor of joining this order were selected from among the city's other knighthoods.</p>
<h3>Entry Requirements</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for becoming a member of the Order of the Ravens included having two- calendar -years of service in another knighthood, having 15 different knightly honors, to have completed some form of a quest, and to have two letters of recommendation. These letters could be from either other knights, city officials, or important city leaders. Finally, the candidate needed to petition themselves to the city's Knights Council, at which point their entire history as a knight would be reviewed, i.e. their Knight's Diary and permanent record.</p>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , the prerequisites for entry application to the Knights of the Raven were modified. Instead of simply 15 knightly honors, an applicant had to have 20. Instead of two letters of recommendation, one was needed from each of Ravens Bluff's knighthoods. Additionally, the requirement of owning a deed to Titled Land was added, as well as a restriction towards rogues .</p>
<p>On very rare occasions an individual could be made an "acting" Raven Knight for the purposes of undertaking an important task, like representing Ravens Bluff at a treaty arrangement after the diplomat responsible for it fell to an assassin . This appointment could be made by the head of the Order of the Ravens, as well as senior lord or city official. If the acting knight performed their duties admirably, there was a small chance they could be awarded a permanent place in the order. However, these "back-door knights" as they were called by some were looked down upon and viewed with suspicion by those who earned their place in the Raven Knights in the traditional manner.</p>
<p>Once an individual was approved for admission to the order, the public ceremony of indoctrination would be held, wherein the new Raven Knight had to recite the order's oath as it was administered by Ravens Bluff's mayor.</p>
<h3>Duties</h3>
<p>Members of the Raven Knights carried the responsibility of serving as commanders and generals in the Ravens Bluff Army in times of war.</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>The Knights of the Ravens were counted among priests of Ravens Bluff's Civic Religion were obligated to provide healing services to.</p>
<h3>Sub-Orders</h3>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The day-to-day goings on of these knights and their long term missions were comparatively far more clandestine and kept secret than those of the city's initiate and secular knightly orders.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Amongst the Vast , a region that was a bastion of the art of blade magic, its use was notably quite prevalent among the Raven Knights.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<h3>Knightly Honors</h3>
<p>All knightly orders of the City of Ravens were open to the acquisition of "knightly honors", objects that officially recognized and respected their accomplishments as knights. The Knights of the Raven had a number of special honors that only members of their order could be awarded. These included the following:</p>
