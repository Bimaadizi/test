<p>Melody Mount Walk was a magically lit tunnel in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep that ran west up to the cliffs on which the New Olamn barding college was situated. The tunnel contained a little-known portal between Waterdeep and the keep in Rassalantar .</p>
<p>The tunnel was continuously resounding with music due to an ongoing concert known as the Neverending String of Pearls that was performed by bardic students from New Olamn in a small alcove in the tunnel.</p>
