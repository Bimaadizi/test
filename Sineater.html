<p>Sineater was an immense purple worm that dwelled in the Underdark beneath the Cay'Vorym Fighting Pit in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sineater was a truly massive example of a purple worm, far larger and stronger than any others. It had a vibrant internal ecosystem of ooze -like digestive slimes, parasitic leeches, and scavenger vermin that thrived in its cavernous guts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , House Cay'Vorym operated the Cay'Vorym Fighting Pit, where Feryl Cay'Vorym ran bloodsports between gladiators , slaves , and monsters. The house took advantage of the war to take captured Purple Dragons and use them for entertainment. When Sorina Parnock sent a team from Eveningstar to rescue them, Feryl dropped them into the arena and forced them to fight for their lives, culminating in him summoning up purple worms from deeper underground. While an extraordinary show, the wild monsters destroyed the arena stands and devoured the spectators in the process, culminating in Sineater breaking through the floor, eating Feryl, and collapsing the entire arena. The Cormyrean band fell down into a great cavern below the area—filled with enormous unhatched worm eggs—and after a brief battle they too were swallowed.</p>
<p>The Cormyreans fought their way through the guts of Sineater as they were slowly digested by stomach acid , finding fragments of the shattered Earthcarver as they went. Along the way they overcame a group of confused and desperate yuan-ti , various digestive threats, and finally found Feryl and his drow companions. After a climactic battle Feryl was slain and the last pieces of Earthcarver put together, then they used it to carve a hole in the side of Sineater and escape. While Sineater was reeling from the mortal wound, the Cormyreans performed one final assault and finally slew the great beast, leaving its remains among the eggs in the cavern.</p>
