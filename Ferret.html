<p>The ferret was a common animal in the Realms, related to weasels .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like weasels, these animals were small and furry creatures, measuring 1​ to ​2 feet (0.3​ to ​0.61 meters) in length from head to tail.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Ferrets could be extremely aggressive but chose to attack smaller prey.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h3>Semberholme</h3>
<p>The Semberholme ferret was found in the Semberholme area of the Cormanthor forest. It was characterized by its color-changing fur, which was normally brown but became white in the winter to provide extra camouflage against wolves .</p>
<h3>Swamp</h3>
<p>The swamp ferret was found in the swamps of the High Moor . Their bodies typically grew to a length of 2 feet (0.61 meters) and had deep brown fur with gray or green markings. They were excellent swimmers, as well as a rather cunning and quite vicious species, even by ferret standards. They were unafraid to attack even mammals that were larger than themselves— Elminster had once heard of a small group of swamp ferrets taking down a full-grown goblin . However, they were primarily known to eat young rabbits and rats . They made their nests inside of small trees, usually close to other nests.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Much like stoats , the fur pelt of a ferret was not considered to be very valuable.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Beyond Toril , ferrets could be found on the planet Garden .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some wizards were known to have them as familiars .</p>
