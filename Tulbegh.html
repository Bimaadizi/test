<p>Tulbegh was a small coastal village in Sembia on the Sea of Fallen Stars ' northwestern shores.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tulbegh stood on the shores where the Dragon Coast met the Sea of Fallen Stars at the base of a peninsula that protruded from the mainland immediately south of the town. Along the peninsula's shores, south from Tulbegh stood a monkish retreat, a known travel destination.</p>
<p>Tulbegh's waters varied in temperature from temperate to cool, and it was known for temperamental weather being blown ashore from the sea. Tulbegh was often surrounded by dark rain clouds, receiving its heavy share of precipitation.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Tulbegh and its closest neighbor to the northwest, the town of Surd , were connected via the Coastwatch , that continued moving north along the coast, reaching the town of Yhaunn . Those who traveled to Tulbegh from Ordulin , moved along Taela's Trail to Surd, and from there along the Coastwatch until they reached their destination. The shoreline between Tulbegh and Yhaunn was not known for being picturesque. Still, it supported numerous tiny fishing villages and lone fishermens' houses.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, glass bottleworks in Tulbegh remained a profitable business with the Ampner family of Ravens Bluff being among the industry's major investors. However, the town's main industry and the source of food was fishing in the Sea of Fallen Stars. Lastly, Tulbegh farmers were renowned across the Realms for their osquip milk that was mixed with a certain type of seaweed mash to make baby food.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Occasionally, Tulbegh was menaced by roving monsters. Circa the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , a group of scrags , sea trolls , began attacking the locations along the coastline, from Marsember in Cormyr , eventually reaching every coastal city east of it, ending at Tulbegh. The attacks lasted for several months until joined forces of soldiers, sailors, and mages culled the scags, eventually removing the threat altogether.</p>
<p>Around the same time, a suspicious merchant arrived in the nearby city of Surd after making stops in Yhaunn and Tulbegh. The man came selling exquisite pieces of authentic sahuagin jewelry and art, including a dwarf -sized stature. The man claimed to be on a mission to share the "beauty of the sea" with the poorer coastal communities. He was selling his art for a stunningly low price. However, soon after he left Surd, its inhabitants discovered that an angry sahuagin tribe was searching for their stolen valuables. The identity of the shady merchant remained unknown, but the coastal cities of Surd and Tulbegh offered a reward for capturing the man whose appearance was likely a magical illusion created by an enchanted ring . Some believed that this stolen jewelry sale was an intentionally malicious act aimed at stressing the relationship between human and sahuagin communities of the Dragon Reach.</p>
