<p>Lopango was once part of Merrouroboros , the ancient super-continent that eventually broke up into Faerûn , Kara-Tur , Maztica, and Zakhara . Lopango was known for its active volcanoes at this time. During the height of the Batrachi Empires , circa −31,500 DR in the Days of Thunder , the batrachi lord Bazim-Gorag claimed that his domain stretched "to the fiery peaks of Lopango in the south".</p>
<p>In the Year of Sleeping Dangers, 370 DR , the Shoon Imperium 's Great Colony Fleet set out from Calimshan to colonize the Moonshae Isles with 600 ships. After a great storm fell upon them and blew them off course, the surviving twenty ships were stranded on the shores of Lopango.</p>
