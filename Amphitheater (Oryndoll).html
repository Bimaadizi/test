<p>The Amphitheater in Oryndoll was located in the nexus tunnels, which connected five separate Ring Caverns . This was the largest gladiatorial arena in the city, and had several features in it that other arenas in the hive normally did not possess. The main use of the Amphitheater was in an event called a dominance tournament, which was a popular sport in the city.</p>
<p>Mind flayers that pitted their thralls against each another in a dominance tournament would stand on opposing twin platforms and entertained an audience of up to one thousand illithids at once. The arena also had crystals spread throughout the stands that were psionically attuned. These crystals enabled the audience to passively feel the sensations of the thralls as they were channeled through the illithid competitors during combat.</p>
