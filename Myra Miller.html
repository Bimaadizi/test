<p>Myra Miller was a clerk who worked for the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet in the city of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Ches of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Myra Miller received a mention in that month's issue of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter . After the offices of the Trumpeter were ransacked and torched (evidently by Talassans ) while the staff were away at the local printer's shop, Myra, a simple clerk, showed quick thinking and managed to save the broadsheet's documents from being destroyed. Despite Myra Miller's best efforts, all reports of the summer meteor crisis of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR were lost.</p>
