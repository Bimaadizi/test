<p>The Yeti language was the racial language of yetis .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Beyond yetis themselves, this language was a common secondary language among the arctic dwarves , who lived within the distance of many yetis in the Great Glacier , and more rarely was known among people living in the Icewind Dale region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beyond just being a verbal language, Yeti exhibited a sort of runic system that was used to mark trailside features, such as routes, whether water was safe to drink, or if an area held the risk of a rockslide occurring. They were also used to mark territories or to negotiate with other yetis, the latter of which would be answered by marking a rune beside the original and then in turn responded back to by the original mark-maker by scratching another rune below those two.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the frost giants of Svardborg stumbled upon a tribe of Northlanders living on ice floes in the Sea of Moving Ice who spoke the Yeti language. The frost giants conquered the tribe, then brought them back to Svardborg, relying upon them to command a force of yetis.</p>
