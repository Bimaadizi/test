<h2>History</h2>
<p>Selûne ordered the establishment of the moon knights in response to hostility by her sister Shar . They were active by 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Attitudes</h2>
<p>The moon knights were joyous and good humored when celebrating, but they fostered a deep hatred of the goddess Shar and her faithful , reacting with rage and even bloodlust whenever they encountered them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Supplementing the crusaders of the Selûnite church, the moon knights were charged with defending the church against threats from Shar and even to take the fight to the Sharrans directly.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The moon knights were intimately linked to the goddess and her divine power, such that their abilities waxed and waned with the moon in a form of lunar magic . During the full moon, three days each month, a moon knight became generally more capable and could turn undead with more force. However, during the new moon, three days each month, a moon knight was generally less capable and could not turn undead at all. Moreover, a lycanthrope moon knight had a better chance of controlling themselves, both during the full moon and in their beast forms.</p>
<p>In addition, a moon knight was unable to cast spells or even use magic items that produced darkness. Nevertheless, they trained to fight in the dark and while blinded, to counter Sharran tactics.</p>
<p>Some learned the skills of navigation.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The moon knights uniformly wore splint armor colored silver and white with the two eyes of the goddess emblazoned across the chest, together with a helmet with a blue crest and a cloak of midnight blue. They preferred the moon's hand mace favored by the church.</p>
