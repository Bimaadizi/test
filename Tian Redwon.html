<p>Tian Redwon was the Mayor of the Chondathan city of Shamph in the late-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Mayor Redwon's leadership gave the city its new shield wall and blessed it with a period of economic growth. Tian realized that many merchants preferred to stairway from regular conflicts between other Chondathan cities and flocked with their trade goods to the relatively calm markets of Shamph. Because of that Tian Redwon supported the continuous warfare and was ready to do anything he could to keep the conflict going.</p>
<p>The same year, tales of spirits being sighted along the Old Road emerged. Mayor Redwon thought his to be detrimental to the blossoming trade and hired groups of adventurers to secure the trade route against strange creatures. Not much came out of the investigations, some claimed that the spirits were nothing but a story, while others were concerned by disappearances of the hired adventurers.</p>
