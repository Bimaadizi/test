<p>Fire lichen was a type of lichen that grew in the Underdark near sources of geothermal heat. It was recognizable by its stalks of pale orange-white. When ground to powder and fermented, it formed a paste that was very spicy but edible, added to soups and stews or spread on sporebread for flavor.</p>
