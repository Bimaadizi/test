<p>A warhammer was a type of hammer designed for the purpose of combat and warfare, descended from the polearm hammers known as lucerne hammers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Warhammers resembled large, heavy sledgehammers , with a striking surfaces on either side of the head. Much like lucerne hammers, in the Sword Coast it was not uncommon for warhammers to be made entirely out of steel . They also measured around 18 inches (0.46 meters) in length and featured rondels (small metal disks), often shaped into decorative designs, to protect and strengthen a user's grip.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Warhammers were designed to be wielded one-handed with ease, making them easier for knights to use in mounted combat. Most warriors with martial training were proficient in it.</p>
