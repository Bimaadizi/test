<p>The Iron Road , also known as the Ironford Trail , was a trail from the Bargewright Inn to Uluvin . After Uluvin, it was a little-traveled trail that turned northeast to follow the Unicorn Run to the Stronghold of the Nine . It was named for the flow of iron ore out of the Forlorn Hills in the days when dwarves were numerous in the region.</p>
