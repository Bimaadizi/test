<p>Dhast was a coastal hamlet on the east coast of The Fang in east Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the population was split between a clifftop community and a smaller number of fishermen living on the beach. The two portions of the hamlet were linked via a trail, and a rivalry existed between them, each side considering the other to be stupid and wicked. People in Dhast did not trust outsiders, because most were descendants of those who were refugees to The Fang during the conflict with the half-elves .</p>
