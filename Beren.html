<p>Beren was a sorcerer in the Golden Mane pride of wemics that migrated through the plains of the Shaar during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like the rest of his kin, Beren had golden fur, which in his case was highlighted by a black mane and severe, yellow eyes. He was scrawnier than the other males of the pride, though just in skilled in combat due to the time he spent with human rogues .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>During Beren's time with the pride, Shaq'ar was highly suspicious of his intentions. Beren actively courted the pride's spiritual leader, Kretnor ; while the druid was flattered, she regularly rebuffed his advances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beren was born under the influence of an evil shadow, growing up as a greedy and cruel cub. In his youth he learned to suppress his selfish instincts and feelings and instead act with enough platitude that he could function within his pride. Shaq'ar took note of Beren's insincerity and lack of helpfulness and suggested the young wemic travel from the Shaar and seek a life of adventure.</p>
<p>The dark wemic traveled close to the civilized lands of South Faer√ªn and in short time was taken in by an exceptionally greedy band of adventurers. During his time with this group, Beren learned thieving skills and the art of intimidation, serving as their thug used to scare citizens they met in the rural settlements. In his adventures, Beren learned of his sorcerous abilities and took it upon himself to develop his skills as much as possible.</p>
<p>After an especially poor season spent in the city, Beren returned to the Golden Mane wemics. He hid his arcane abilities as well as the skills he learned as a thief as they weren't in line with the naturalistic lives of the prides rangers and barbarians . Beren's malicious inclinations resurfaced during this time and he schemed against the alpha of the pride, Shaq'ar, by looking for allies in the nearby loxo herds, the thri-kreen and even the nomadic Shaarans who sought the territory of the wemics.</p>
