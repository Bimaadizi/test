<p>Istrid Horn ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ s t r ɪ d / ISS-trid ) was a dwarf agent of the Zhentarim , operating within the city of Waterdeep during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Istrid loved having people indebted to her. She was competitive with her peers when it came to the more legitimate aspects of her business operations, but extremely ruthless when it came time for collection.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Istrid was a member of the Doom Raiders adventuring company. She and her former companions composed the leadership of the Zhentarim of Waterdeep. As the Waterdhavian "Master of Trade and Coins" for the Zhentarim, Istrid employed many thugs and enforcers to collect on her loans.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Istrid was once an adventurer but together with her adventuring companions she decided to join the Zhentarim. In 1489 DR , Istrid and her fellow agents were sent to establish a Zhent foothold in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , Istrid managed an illegal lending operation in a warehouse in the Dock Ward . Her interest rates were comparable to noble bankers like the Cassalanter or the Irlingstars but her penalties were very severe. One of her debtors was Emmek Frewn . After Davil Starsong and other Zhents were captured by the City Watch later that year, following the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath , Istrid tried to discover what had truly happened inside the villa. Fearing being arrested by the City Watch for her illegal loans, she tried to find a place where she could hide for a time.</p>
