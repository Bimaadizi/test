<p>The Trading Company was an organization of mercenaries and arms dealers active in the city of Bral .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>During the reign of Prince Andru , the Senior Agent for the branch of the Company in Bral was Talosa Baniasan , but he preferred to allow the veteran soldiers to run the training and recruitment of the organization, instead handling the matters of their weapon's inventory and trade.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Company refused to take political sides, working for whoever paid them but never for multiple sides of a conflict at the same time.</p>
<p>If a war were to break out in Realmspace , they would begin a massive recruiting drive and begin purchasing more weapons and ships.</p>
<h2>Holdings</h2>
<p>The Trading Company owned a small number of spelljamming vessels , but it preferred to rent ships when needed. They did, however, maintain a large warehouse for stockpiling weapons, located on the intersection of Dock Street and Grand Street in the Low City of Bral .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Only a small group of veteran mercenaries were permanent members of the Company. These were mostly human fighters , but the group had no racial requirements. Most were armed in chainmail , with halberds and light crossbows . About a quarter were highly skilled in a particular weapon. About half of new recruits were provided with leather armor , a handaxe , and either a pike or longbow , while the other half served as men-at-arms.</p>
