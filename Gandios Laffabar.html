<p>Gandios Laffabar was the owner and proprietor of the Giant's Folly festhall that operated Reddansyr during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a man that could readily tell a grand story to impressionable adventurers, often leading others on wild-goose-chases that may or may not have led to them in peril.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The successful business owner was inadvertently at odds with Patriarch Thyrius Jorman , head of the local temple of Oghma . The knowledge-hoarding Oghmite priests resented the free availability of information that could be found having some drinks at the Giant's Folly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Business was so successful as of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , he thought about bringing over a second boat from Westgate to Reddansyr.</p>
