<p>Great Pottery of Luiren was a book that talked about various cooking receptacles of the industrious hin folk of the Shining South , published before the fall of the Seldarine's Hand , centuries before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The tome of Great Pottery of Luiren covered the fascinating subject of pottery from Luiren . The tome prized the hin's dedication to utility and usefulness in cooking over beauty. Even though halflings created expensive, elaborately-decorated pots and dishes inlaid with malachite and lapis , they were exceedingly rare. These particular designs came from the period of time between 750 DR and 830 DR in Luiren and were bracingly different from traditional hin pottery craft. Most common hin pottery was simple and bottom-heavy, molded out of brown-red clay . The glaze was not common and, when used, was often ocher or bright green.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Great Pottery of Luiren was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarine's Hand . By the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. A copy of Great Pottery of Luiren could be found in the citadel's library curated by Custhantos , along with other rare books.</p>
