<p>Thuldra Thuldrin was a dwarf commoner in the late 15 th century DR who was displaced by the Absolute and, as a refugee, sought shelter in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thuldra was a stout clean-shaved dwarven woman with freckled olive skin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees along the way in the process. Thuldra Thuldrin found her way to the Rivington district outside the city walls, but, like all other refugees, she was refused entrance. Being a kind soul, Thuldra worked with the Flaming Fist to feed the refugees in the camp, and asked Father Lorgan of the Open Hand Temple for carrots , apples , or anything they could spare for the starving refugees.</p>
