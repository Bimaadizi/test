<p>The Lost Hills were an especially perilous stretch of hills on the Sword Coast North . They were so named for the magic that afflicted the region, which caused travelers to become hopelessly lost when passing within.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Lost Hills were situated along the northern border of the Sword Mountains , between the settlements of Triboar and Crossergate . They encompassed part of the southern Triboar Trail region , which extended as far north as Neverwinter Wood .</p>
<p>The Triboar Trail passed through the Lost Hills, linking the High Road in the west with the Long Road to the east.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Notable within the Lost Hills was Wyvern Tor , which, as its name suggested, housed a nest of wyverns .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hills had a series of winding paths that allowed for relative ease of travel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to one sage from Neverwinter, the Lost Hills were once a beauteous, peaceful region of the North . Travelers could safely pass over and through its peaks as they journeyed from town to town.</p>
<p>At some point in their history, however, an enigmatic malicious force appeared within the Lost Hills. This force brought with it terrible creatures that plagued anyone that dared pass through.</p>
<p>The hills were then afflicted by a magical enchantment that rendered navigation within nearly impossible. In the years that followed, only the foolhardy or valiant dared navigate the Lost Hills' paths.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , caravans that passed through Crossergate began mysteriously disappearing in the Lost Hills. The Lord Protector of Crossergate made a plea to Lord Nasher Alagondar of Neverwinter, fearing for some unknown danger looming just outside the town walls.</p>
<p>In turn, Lord Nasher tasked hired adventurers to begin an investigation. They discovered that whatever strange evil took residence in the Hills turned the road into a twisting and turning disorienting maze as if it was altered by magic .</p>
