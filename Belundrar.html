<p>Belundrar "the Bear" was a Baron of Galadorna during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was the most loyal baron of King Baerimgrim , and the most law-abiding of them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had hairy hands, a beard, and was huge. His eyes were green, with bushy brows, and his nose was jutting, but battered.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was older than the other barons, and belonged to the oldest and largest noble house in Galadorna. The king viewed him as the best of a bad lot.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>During the meeting about King Baerimgrim's succession, there were many daggers at his belt.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baron Belundrar provided additional armsmen for King Baerimgrim during the ailing man's moot to determine succession in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR . Though he had issues with Baron Hothal 's dealings with Laothkund , he was willing to support that, if it meant a solid bid for the throne. He was then blindsided by Baron Maethor backing Baron Tholone 's bid for the throne, and the rest of the barons coalescing around that one.</p>
<p>A spell then killed Tholone and the king; after Nadrathen tried to make his own bid for the throne, Belundrar attacked him, and was killed by the mage just as quickly.</p>
