Adventurers may have chanced upon him; if they agreed to release him, he'd have turned invisible and fled, stalking them and waiting for the lot to come across these drow and inevitably fight. If they did, he'd attack whoever won that fight; he wouldn't slay the adventurers if they were taken down by the drow, however.</p>
