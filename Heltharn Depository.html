<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1396Â DR , Seren Juramot had been using the depository to store the money she sought to use to buy her freedom from Thay after the loss of her enclave's funds in Raven's Bluff during the Spellplague . That year, however, after Xxiphu rose from the depths, Seren found the ogres that usually kept watch at the front door missing; she inquired with other customers, and learned they claimed to have appointed Morgenthel as its new Master of Coins.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Besides the defensive stonework, two ogres generally guarded the entrance. Inside, a number of protective wards and charms were active.</p>
