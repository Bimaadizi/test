<p>The copper hawk was a unique construct used by Strasus Thingoleir .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hawk was made from burnished copper and imitated the mannerisms of a bird, moving and acting like a living creature. It had chips of sapphire for eyes cut from the same one used in the magic rapier Quick , granting it the same affinity for electricity. When it attacked, the wings crackled with energy.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>To attack, the copper hawk would pump its wings and launch a bolt of lightning out of its mouth. The blast was not exceptionally deadly, but it could launch many of them in rapid succession with great accuracy. When sufficiently aggravated, it could launch a much larger, more powerful blast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Strasus Thingoleir obtained the hawk in order to guard his private study and workshop in Fourstaves House . When his son Keph Thingoleir intruded in order to steal The Leaves of One Night , the copper hawk gave him a great deal of trouble until he struck it repeatedly with a wooden stool, destroying it.</p>
