<p>Hangman's nooses were a type of sweet spiced curiously-shaped bread from the wizard nation of Halruaa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halruaa was home to several types of sweet breads beloved by locals. One such sweet treat was called hangman's noose for its district shape of a braided pastry ending in a loop on the bottom. The sweet dough was shaped and fried in hot bubbling fat, growing plump and crunchy. When cooked, the nooses were left to dry on wooden T-shaped racks. When ready to serve, hangman's nooses were generously dusted and rolled in powdered sugar and a mix of several rare local spices: allspice , cardamom , and mace .</p>
<p>The cauldrons of bubbling fat were ket hot with simple spells , which made anything cooked in them unavailable to the nation's jordaini population, as they were forbidden from using anything magical.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , one of the fried bread stalls that sold hangman's noose in Halarahh stood shaded by bright red silk and shaded by tree canopies on the city's markets, not far from the Arbor Square . A young talented spell-slinger and a future war hero Tzigone, frequented the stall and once purchased the bread for several small currency wedge-shaped electrums for her jordaini ally Matteo , who turned the offer down due to the bread being cooked with the use of magic, taboo to the jordaini.</p>
