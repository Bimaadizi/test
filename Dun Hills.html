<p>The Dun Hills were a series of hills in Tasseldale in the Dalelands . They separated Tasseldale from Deepingdale to the west and Battledale to the north. As of 1372 DR , the hills were generally considered to be safe, containing wild ponies .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Before the followers of Tyr established their abbey and the Sun Soul monks settled within, the Dun Hills had been assaulted by Perytons , wyverns and rife with monsters such as trolls , goblinkin and even human raiders. The presence of these spiritual-martial groups have greatly improved the hills' safety.</p>
<p>The green dragon Sirvinhandra , who was responsible for an attack on holy fortress of Tyr, made a lair within the Dun Hills until her death in 1373 DR .</p>
