<p>The Dragon Defeated was an inn in Halfknot . It was renamed the Royal Rescue after Petra's visit in 1362 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was in Halfknot , a town within Sembia .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The place served beer, and food, including rat meat pies.</p>
<p>Through the second half of 1362 DR , the owner, Varney , organized a contest where every customer could drop a single coin in a jar to tell an anecdote about dragons , which would be judged by three locals: Wyrmbait Nix , Badger Bates , and Silvenestri Silver . The best story every night got to keep the whole jar.</p>
<p>After the winter of 1362 DR , the Dragon Defeated was renamed the Royal Rescue, and bards were hired to tell stories about royalty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , the owner, Varney, accepted the offer of Petra , a traveling artist, to paint him a new sign. He requested the new sign have three regulars at his tavern, Wyrmbait Nix, Silvenestri Silver, and Badger Bates, as heroes defeating a dragon and saving a princess. Later, the owner started a nightly contest where people would tell of their exploits with dragons. The last night this contest was held, the painter, Petra, painted a painting of Malaeragoth , who appeared and destroyed the tavern, killing Badger Bates; only the sign survived, with all but the princess broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>Varney repaired and reopened the tavern later, renamed the "Royal Rescue", but some other calamity befell it later.</p>
