<p>Flame was a smuggler and kidnapper who lived in the city of Selgaunt , in Sembia during the midâ€“14 th century DR . He worked with a few trusted allies, and could be contacted through the Green Gauntlet inn found in the city. They would either abduct targets for ransom, or smuggle the willing out of certain locations, typically so they could find safety.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite his distinct pseudonym, Flame was a quiet and rather indistinguishable young man.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Flame and his gang, including some wizards, specialized in hiding or transporting willing people, and kidnapping and ransoming unwilling people. He could be contacted at the Green Gauntlet in the city docks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before he worked in human trafficking, Flame was an arsonist within his home city. He was stopped by a group of clerics and mages and struck down with a series of flame strikes to convince him of the error of his ways. He set upon a self-imposed exile for some time, before returning to Selgaunt, where he established his more inconspicuous business endeavor.</p>
