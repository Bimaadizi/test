<p>A stone of controlling earth elementals was a magical item that could be used to summon and control an earth elemental .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A stone looked like a chunk of roughly polished rock.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When the stone's command word was spoken, it could summon a subservient earth elemental to the user once per day, provided enough earthlike material was present. It required a minimum of four cubic yards of earth, natural stone, sand, mud, or clay, and the conjured elemental was made of the same material.</p>
<p>Earth, mud, and clay tended to create the strongest elementals, while stone and sand created somewhat weaker ones.</p>
