<p>Rings of elemental infusion were enchanted rings that absorbed elemental magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These rings were golden bands with a single mysterious gemstone set at the center. The stone tended to change its color when the wearer was not looking.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A ring of elemental infusion made its enchantment evident once the wearer successfully hit a target with a cantrip that dealt acid , cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage. It became infused with the spell's elemental magics that could be channeled by the wearer into any successful weapon attack, giving it an elemental edge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , one ring of elemental infusion belonged to Gish Umr'a'ac stationed in Crèche Y'llek 's infirmary.</p>
