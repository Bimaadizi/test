<p>The Curious Contraption that Goes Boing was a strange and mysterious magical mechanism from the Tomb underneath Gillian's Hill .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The contraption had a thick base, a long spring-like bouncy stem, and was topped with a round crystal head. When used, it made a loud "boing" sound.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Curious Contraption that Goes Boing came from the ancient and almost-inaccessible Tomb under Gillian's Hill. Even though it was plundered from the Underdark long before 1372 DR , it still held numerous mysteries. In the past, the Tomb was also a home of a mind flayer hive that brainwashed merchants of the Trade Way and lured them to certain death within the ancient subterranean tunnels. Eventually, illithids were cleaned out by a group of heroes, but the Tomb remained a mysterious place, only accessible via an invisible portal . Sometime before 1372 DR but after the illithids' departure, a group of warriors and barbarians managed to get inside the Tomb and did some plundering. Not versed in the arcane , they dragged the Curious Contraption that Goes Boing to the surface, hoping it was of some value.</p>
<p>Torleth Mindulspeer of Torleth's Treasures purchased the widget for several gold coins and kept in the shop to entertain local kids who liked bouncing on the device. Illithids would've been terrified to see their arcane technology used this way.</p>
