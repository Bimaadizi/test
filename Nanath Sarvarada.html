<p>Mroarild Sarvarada was a traveling merchant, performer, gemcutter, hedge wizard , and the adoptive mother of Taline Telgara around the turn of the 10 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a merchant, she sold minor articles of clothing and jewelry; his routine performanced included juggling, dancing, acrobatics, and short comedy stints with her husband. They adopted Taline Telgara , an orphan from near Everlund , whose family had been killed in an orcish raid; she soon joined their performances. By Taline's second season as a performer, both Nanath and her husband were adamant they only perform as a family, never alone. She was a hedge wizard in addition to her other talents, and she taught Taline what little magic she knew early on. Eventually Nanath retired from the road, and became a gemcutter for a coster based in Athkatla , together with her husband, Mroarild Sarvarada .</p>
