<p>Reinhar II was an Arkaiun warchief from Dambrath .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>After the death and defeat of Reinhar I at the hands of Mycontil in Halruaa , Reinhar II assumed command of the remaining forces of invading Arkaiun. They immediately set out for Dambrath, struggling on a grueling march through the Walls of Halruaa before arriving home two months later. Only 1,000 of the initial 40,000 who invaded Halruaa survived to return to Dambrath.</p>
<p>Reinhar II ruled as effectively in defeat as his father did while at war. He pulled all remaining warriors home, knowing they were exposed to attack from outside forces.</p>
