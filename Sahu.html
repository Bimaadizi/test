<p>Sahu was a large island in the Crowded Sea to the southwest of Afyal .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Like in other places in the Ruined Kingdoms area of Zakhara , ancient ruins dotted the jungles and mountains, which were left here by two fallen empires: the worshipers of Thasmudyan of old and, following it, the New Dynasty of the Necromancer Kings . Many dark secrets and dangers to would-be adventurers hid in land and buildings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sahu was also called the " Isle of Serenity ", a name usually attributed to the calm lifestyle of its residents in the 1360s . The byword also had a much more ancient and sinister connotation, however: "Sahu" itself was a word in the dead language of Kadari and can be loosely translated as "Serene Eternity", meaning nothing else but "death".</p>
<h2>Notable locations</h2>
<p>Two places of modern habitation, the villages of Misbahd and Jinutt , were located on the island's northern shore. The inner part of the island consisted of a wooded plateau with a mountain range called the Vishap's Spine along the center.</p>
<p>Along the shoreline of this island were ruined structures similar to the famed metal towers of Rog'osto . But unlike the intact spires of that city, these were toppled and twisted heaps that littered the island's low shores in random clusters.</p>
