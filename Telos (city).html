<p>Telos City , also called simply Telos , was the largest and newest city in Vaasa in the late 15 th century DR . It served as the realm's capital and the seat of power for the evil Warlock Knights .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Telos City sat just north of the cliffs above the Beaumaris River in the central Vaasan highlands, and just south of the Cinnabar Wastes . It connected to Vaasa's main road, Dead Man's Walk , via a bridge which spanned the 500 foot (150 meter) deep Razack's Scar canyon to the south.</p>
<p>The city center was situated inside of a blast crater that was a half-mile (805 meters) across and over 800 feet (240 meters) deep.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city and the surrounding realm were overseen by the Ironfell Council , which was comprised of the twelve most powerful landowning Warlock Knights from across Vaasa. They were led in deliberations by the enigmatic Voice of Telos , who served as the absolute ruler of the city. The Council convened in the centrally located Citadel of the Iron Sky for five days each month to consider state matters.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<h3>Social Class</h3>
<p>The Warlock Knights enforced a strict social and racial hierarchy with themselves at the top. Beneath the Knights were the common folk, referred to as serfs. Beneath the serfs were the "scamps," a derogatory term for members of smaller races. Finally, at the bottom of the hierarchy were the slaves .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>No gods had temples in the city, and the people were not permitted to worship them. Instead, veneration of the primordial Telos was practiced, with quasi-religious services held in the Citadel of the Iron Sky. This and similar shrines dedicated to Telos were maintained by a sect of powerful warlocks called the Luminaries .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Telos was as much a fortress as it was a city, with high defensive walls, many protective wards and spells, and a garrison of hardened Warlock Knights . In addition, a dozen storm giants loyal to the Voice of Telos watched over the city from a cloud palace that circled above.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the primordial Telos fell from the sky during the Spellplague , the future Voice of Telos was the first to discover the location of its comatose body. With the power gained from this encounter, the Voice founded the Warlock Knights, and at the Voice's behest, Telos City was built atop the impact crater where Telos lay. The Warlock Knights would go forth to conquer Vaasa by 1470 DR , and Telos City swelled to become the biggest settlement in Vaasa as the many people displaced by the Knights' conquest ironically found themselves seeking shelter within their oppressors' walls.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Visitors to Telos were forbidden to visit the city center without special permission.</p>
<p>Areas which were off-limits to visitors included:</p>
<p>Visitors were permitted free access to locations in the city's outer areas, including:</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many of the city's inhabitants had come to Telos after losing their homes during the Warlock Knights' conquest of Vaasa. As of 1480 DR , the city housed 15,000 people, of which 60% were Vaasan humans and 20% were dwarves . The remainder was made up of orcs and "scamps" (referring mostly to goblins , kobolds , and halflings ), as well as the occasional giant . The majority of non-humans in Telos were slaves or conscripted soldiers.</p>
