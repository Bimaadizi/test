<p>An apparatus of Gond was a large, metallic vehicle developed in the late-15 th century DR by master artificers of the Church of Gond as an homage to the famous apparatus of Kwalish .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These contraptions lacked the central porthole, dual periscope eyes, and rear exhaust-pipe that an apparatus of Kwalish exhibited. Instead they sported four small portholes in the front, which glowed with the interior light, and a rear extension resembling the tail of a giant lobster .</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Some Gondsmen were known to have created miniature, toy versions of these apparatuses.</p>
