<p>An ogre slug was a creature with the upper body of an ogre and the lower body of a large slug .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were considered to be uglier than typical ogres. Their heads, upper torsos, and arms were those of ogres, and the parts lower than this were those of slugs.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In addition to strikes dealt with their powerful arms, ogre slugs could spit a corrosive, acidic saliva. The acid was so potent that it could potentially dissolve armor and other equipment, inflicting high damage. Ogre slugs were immune to the effects of such acid.</p>
<p>Their hide was rubbery and thick, and to a degree protected them from blows dealt with blunt weapons .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Ogre slugs laired in damp caverns, living in tribes. These tribes numbered from as little as twelve to over forty, and there may have been ogre slug shamans among their ranks, each with access to healing, protection, and divination spells .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These creatures kept giant slugs as guards. Groups of ogre slugs were known to go on raids, which were led by a powerful leader. When raiding and scavenging, these monstrous hybrids much preferred to feast on human or demihuman flesh. They enjoyed the flesh of humans so much that they would much rather consume them immediately, rather than keep them as slaves .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , ogre slugs dwelled in the Mages' Guild of Myth Drannor .</p>
