<p>Darkmaw the Wicked , also known as The Terror of Cloakwood , was a powerful and much-feared massive brown bear who lived on the Sword Coast sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Darkmaw the Wicked earned its infamy by being a vicious and fearsome predator who claimed the territory between the Wood of Sharp Teeth and the Cloak Wood sometime before the late 14 th century DR. The bear, seemingly, killed for fun and preyed on the weakest and the oldest. Stories claimed that he killed more children than any vampire on the Sword Coast; they also stated that the monstrous bear was at last slain in a battle against an army of five hundred.</p>
<p>After the beast's demise, Darkmaw's body was stuffed, its limbs broken to be posed and eyes replaced by glass marbles, and put on display at the Last Light Inn in the town of Reithwin in the Chionthar Valley , sometime before the 1373Â DR , when a bitter war between General Ketheric Thorm consumed the town of Reithwin and an army of Harpers resulted in the region being swallowed by a dark Sharran curse . The inn remained empty until the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , when it was briefly freed from the curse by a group of Harpers. The stuffed body of Darkmaw the Wicked remained in the inn and the fearsome beast's legend was still remembered, as remarked on by some who saw the bear on display. Darkmaw's infamy was so grand that even the githyanki knew of the ferocious killer bear.</p>
