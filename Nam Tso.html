<p>Nam Tso was a lake in Tabot ; "tso" meant "lake" in the Tabotan language .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Amidst a thick bamboo forest, Nam Tso lay in southern Tabot, north of the city of Bidnop So and near the border with Phutan . It was fed by two rivers, both from the Po Yul Dzayul Range : the Nam River from the base of the Marnu Cliffs and the Wohani River from Phutan.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Nam Tso was said to be home to a human -like people who were actually fish â€”in fact, a community (or school) of friendly carp hengeyokai . Having rescued a few fishermen and a young girl, they were well regarded and protected by the people of Bidnop So, who knew them as the "lake people". Sometimes visiting the markets of Bidnop So, the carp people traded rice and opals collected from the lake bed for things they couldn't manufacture.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Fishermen here used specially trained birds to catch fish for them. A brass collar prevented the bird from swallowing the fish.</p>
