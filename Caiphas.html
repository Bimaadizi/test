<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Caiphas ran afoul of a powerful sha'ir named Adnan al-Raqi who, in order to teach the genie a lesson, used a limited wish to bury Caiphas up to his neck in the desert sand. Caiphas was to remain buried until freed by travelers whom he could convince to help set him free. To make matters worse for Caiphas, Adnan branded the word "liar" on his forehead and cursed him so he could only speak the truth.</p>
<p>Caiphas would reward anyone who helped him with three wishes , but as of 1367 DR he had been buried for several decades.</p>
