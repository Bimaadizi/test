<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flinderspeld hailed from Blingdenstone .
He eventually came into the possession of Q'arlynd Melarn , who further controlled the gnome with a slave ring. While able to control Flinderspeld's mind and body, Q'arlynd was actually a fairly lenient master who never abused his slave to any serious degree. Eventually, Q'arlynd freed Flinderspeld and the gnome became a gem merchant relocating in Silverymoon .</p>
