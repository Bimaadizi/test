<p>The soybean was a species of legume native to the continent of Kara-Tur , widely grown for its edible bean . It was a staple crop in many parts of that continent.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>In the lands of Kara-Tur, soybeans were most widely grown in the kingdoms of Shou Lung and later Kozakura , whose agrarian economy had long been dominated by rice production.</p>
<p>Over in Faerûn , soybeans began being cultivated in Marsember in the late 15 th century DR , after several Shou migrated to the city and established the Shou-town district of Xiousing .</p>
<h2>Soy Products</h2>
<p>The soybean was very versatile in its uses, being used in a variety of different ways across Kara-Turan cuisine. They were most commonly stewed or mashed into a paste, which could then be dried, fermented, flavored, or sweetened. This paste was typically used as either a dip or a filling for buns, to make candies, or made into a salty sauce that could in turn be used to used to flavor nearly any dish. This sauce was widely known in neighboring Faerûn, to the extent that it was sold in Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
<p>The other major product of soybeans was tofu , the congealed protein curds extracted from the juice or "milk" of mashed soybeans. And much like the bean it was derived from, tofu was a very versatile food item in Kara-Turan cuisine, able to be pressed into cakes or made into bean curd noodles .</p>
