<p>Cyl was a wealthy family of Neverwinter that reached prominence sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Cyl was already a well-established family in Neverwinter. The family elders hoped to cobble together a beneficial mercantile alliance by wedding their daughter, Anali Cyl , into a wealthy merchant family from Waterdeep , the City of Splendors. This plan coincided with the Luskan - Neverwinter war of 1372 DR, and Anali was to be shipped away from the conflict to her betrothed in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>The young woman was outraged over this plan and would rather perish defending Neverwinter than be wed against her will. Anali's parents sneered at their daughter's words until she grabbed the family heirloom falchion Decision off the wall, and stormed out.</p>
<p>Anali Cyl joined the defending forces of Neverwinter and, over the course of the war, became a renowned General. She wielded Decision in every battle since leaving her family estate behind.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, there remained no members of the Cyl clan in Neverwinter. However, branches of the family were still active in Athkatla , Silverymoon , and Zazesspur . A bastard Cyl, who chose not to use his family name, could be found living in Scornubel .</p>
