<p>Yarthrain was a small village found in the Backlands region of the Western Heartlands . It was named after a traitorous wizard that was featured in ballad from the southern realm of Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The center of the village comprised a handful of great stone houses that surrounded a ruined stone castle.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated on the southern back of the Winding Water , upstream from Boareskyr Bridge , northeast of the Forest of Wyrms .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The folks of Yarthrain provided for themselves by growing crops, herding sheep and cows , and fishing from the Winding Water.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yarthrain was founded in the late 13 th century DR , by the Amnian mercenary Zelarravyan Fangshield . With the backing of Amnian merchants that were pleased to have him leave their country, Fangshield moved north from the Lands of Intrigue headed for the landmark of the Hill of Lost Souls . Upon his arrival declared himself Baron of the Backlands and immediately called for construction of a castle in his honor. The baron and his soldiers endured a rough first winter in the north, and suffered attacks from hobgoblins and orcish raiders.</p>
<p>While the baron proved ill-prepared for rulership, the settlement survived his brief, months-long reign and its citizens somehow salvaged their village.</p>
<p>Yarthrain remained in a half-destroyed state in the Backlands for decades, well into the mid–14 th century. In the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR a Zhent caravan bound for Yarthrain was destroyed, presumably a group of Red Wizards and their undead minions.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumors of Zhentarim control over the small village circulated across the region circa the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
