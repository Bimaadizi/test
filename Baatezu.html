<p>Baatezu ( sing & pl ; pronounced : / b eɪ ˈ ɑː t ɛ z uː / bay-AT-eh-zoo or : /ˈ b ɑː t ɛ z ʌ / BAH-teh-zu ) were the dominant race of devils in the Nine Hells , once evil mortals whose souls, due to diabolical deed or infernal contract, were condemned to Baator. Stripped of individuality through vile torture and remade from the divine energy harvested from the collective corrupted, the baatezu institutionalized suffering, ascending to tyranny on the backs of the damned.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The primary goal of most baatezu was to advance up the infernal hierarchy, their motivation being the potential to take part in shaping the multiverse. Those that followed their ideals of lawful evil advanced earlier than those who did not, preferred qualities including the capacity for betrayal and deceit.</p>
<p>According to one theory, the baatezu who excelled at these endeavors were also those who suffered the most, because they lacked them at some point. The observation was that friendships most often developed among lower-ranking baatezu and the circle grew smaller and smaller as they advanced. It also occurred that higher-ranking baatezu acted like mentors to lower-ranking ones by subtly urging the mentored's associates towards betrayal, thus teaching the betrayed the virtue of self-reliance.</p>
<p>Baatezu changed their physical form when they were promoted or demoted, and with the physical change came a psychological one. Some believed that a baatezu lost its memories whenever they were changed, but in truth they almost always retained their minds. With an increase in power came usually also an increase in intelligence, and with it the ability to tap into their memories, possibly centuries-worth for each station in their lives.</p>
<p>It was often the case that the sheer amount of their memories exceeded their capacity to sort through it meaning they would need a long time to remember particularly unimportant pieces of knowledge. If one were to remain out of their mind for long enough, causing them to be classified as insignificant, one could use the time frame it took the baatezu to remember them to make their move. Even so, baatezu were universally vindictive creatures, forcing the culprit to be constantly watch their backs if they crossed one.</p>
<p>Despite holding lawful evil outlooks, low-ranking baatezu still held some shred of chaos inside them, which could cause them to behave disobediently. The first impulse of these savage devils (including the likes of the mindless lemures and nupperibos as well as the sapient abishai) was to attack first and ask questions never.</p>
<p>It was difficult to psychologically best baatezu, especially high-ranking ones, but one way to get the better of them, or at least throw the lawful creatures into confusion, was to act on superficially chaotic reflexes. However, instinctive movements weren't truly chaotic, and intelligent baatezu could see the systematics of these supposedly random behaviors, rendering this tactic only usable against the dumb and/or low-ranking. It was also possible, if difficult, to outwit a baatezu by somehow convincing them that their way of life was wrong. This would be a tricky tactic since baatezu were indoctrinated into their belief system, and if the attempt was a trick, they wouldn't fall for the same one twice, no matter who tried it.</p>
<h3>Rogue Baatezu</h3>
<p>On occasion, baatezu were known to go rogue, rejecting Hell's hierarchy and turning towards some other way of life. Rogues were not merely hated by other baatezu, but hunted to death by them. A subgroup of rogues were known as the risen, the antithesis of fallen angels, who took up nobler ideals of good. Since it was difficult to tell a fellow risen baatezu apart from a baatezu assassin who was merely pretending, the already rare creatures normally stayed away from one another.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Baatezu were completely immune to fire and poison . They had also a tolerance against acid, low temperatures and gases. One way to combat them was with silver weaponry, but this was not as effective as fighting with a holy weapon or with electricity. Holy water was also effective against the baatezu.</p>
<p>Sometimes, baatezu had regenerative capabilities. One way to circumvent this was to eat the baatezu. This was the normal method by which demons solved this problem of combating them.</p>
<p>It was dangerous to try and cast detect thoughts on a baatezu. Their minds worked in ways that mortals could not handle. Reading a baatezu's mind rendered a person insane or at best in a mental state that was similar to that created by a feeblemind spell. The latter was not just temporary, but was the product of the mind-reader having success at processing some information.</p>
<p>Usually, baatezu had an array of innate (inborn and usable without training) spells and spell-like abilities. These abilities were so ingrained in the baatezu that using them required less mental effort than a human using limbs. These abilities usually included some form of teleportation , which allowed them to disengage combat and re-enter it in a favorable position. Something they often did. Another ability a baatezu usually had was the ability to call their brethren for aid. This ability meant that any formerly numerically even fight could quickly devolve into a mauling due to the quickly created numerical superiority of the baatezu.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Start of a Baatezu Life</h3>
<p>A typical baatezu life started as a soul of a dead lawful evil mortal on Baator. The dozen or so souls that were deemed the best out of about a hundred thousand were turned into lemures . Baatezu also bought additional souls from night hags . The selection standards were how well the larva could fend for itself. This process was as artificial as it sounded. Leaving a soul alone caused it to become a nupperibo, the natural result.</p>
<p>Nupperibos were gathered and turned into lemures. This was sold as a demotion but in truth, the process was a change into something completely different. The reason for this inclusion into baatezu ranks was that the baatezu were cautious to not leave the nupperibo alone so that they had a chance to evolve into something that may be strong but not one of their own.</p>
<p>The third way in which a baatezu could start its life was to spontaneously arise from the plane of Baator. This was very rare.</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>Baatezu fell in three categories: least, lesser, and greater baatezu. Baatezu had the option to be promoted when they learned the one lesson that their current form tried to teach them about the nature of lawful evil. Lemures and nupperibos were an exception.</p>
<p>The ways by which a baatezu could be promoted were twofold: First was promotion by chance, only open to lemures, and second intentional promotion, a bureaucratic process. The baatezu had ministries that observed every single baatezu and kept records about them to be absolutely certain whom to promote and whom not.</p>
<p>On an individual level baatezu wanted to rise to a position where they would not be pushed around (the motivation of low-ranking baatezu), on macro level to improve the lot of their entire race (the motivation of high-ranking baatezu). The baatezu did this because their survival hinged on it. For example, fighting the Blood War was only possible for the numerically disadvantaged devils because they had competent commanders.</p>
<p>The criteria that the Ministry of Promotion evaluated were time served and performance. Baatezu had a minimum time they had to serve in a particular role that could only grow depending on their performance. A "good performance" by baatezu standards was not necessarily defined by the show of excellence as much as the absence of mistakes, which may mean actual results for a "good performance" were mediocre. Lower-ranking baatezu who learned to master their violent impulses were often first in line for promotion.</p>
<p>Bribing officials and otherwise manipulating the records to influence the promotion of a particular fiend was punishable for both a manipulating official and for a fiend that wanted a promotion. However, this did not mean that it did not happen and the possibility for punishment was viewed as an encouragement to be subtle and good at behind-the-scene-activities.</p>
<p>The exact method by which a baatezu was promoted was undergoing torture. Every form of a baatezu had a different form of torture to attain it. However, there were a few commonalities. First, these torture method were immediate and several baatezu worked in concert to modify or torture the body of the promoted baatezu into its new form, which was always that of a full adult version of the species they were promoted to.</p>
<p>Baatezu society was fully meritocratic with no proverbial "glass ceiling" and where an individual's capabilities and willingness to take command were determining factors in one's success.</p>
<h3>Punishment</h3>
<p>In baatezu society, demotion was taken seriously. A baatezu could be demoted for bad performance and for transgressions. How far a given offender was demoted depended on the severity and frequency and could lead to demotion to a lemure.</p>
<p>Demotion had also the potential to be dangerous for the demoted. This was especially the case when it ended up among the ranks of its direct subordinates. As mentioned above, baatezu were vindictive and were likely to live this trait theirs out by killing their superior for some wrongs it did while it was their superior. To evade this, some demoted baatezu actually went rogue.</p>
<p>The punishment that was most dreaded by the baatezu was to being put into the Pit of Flame .</p>
<h3>Military</h3>
<p>Military service was a hard thing. The military was strictly organized and a place where a high position did not represent a measure of security from being sent to the front line. Furthermore, being part of the military did not mean more or less respect. A baatezu of a given station, meaning form, who held a military rank was held in as high regards as one who had a civilian job. However, for all its harshness, military service was not ungrateful. Baatezu veterans could look forward to fast promotion and had a comparatively realistic chance, meaning any, to enter the baatezu nobility. Civilians needed truly exceptional track records to have a chance to enter nobility.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Baatezu did not come up with learning magic like a wizard by themselves. What they knew about arcane magic was of mortal origin and not of their own. There were not many baatezu with the willingness to devote learning magic in addition to what they owned innately. When they did, it was observed that baatezu who learnt wizardry's potential had a hard limit. Only the pit fiends' potential was without a ceiling, theoretically, they could grow infinitely strong as wizards. However, learning magic from a certain point onwards, could, but not have to, force a baatezu to forego physical training making them weaker than their non-wizard brethren.</p>
<p>There were four kinds of baatezu-wizards. First, the so-called normal ones, these were baatezu with additional learned magic. Second, the so-called distorted ones, these lost their innate ability to resist magic, because it hampered their learnt spellcasting. Third, the so-called unenlightened ones, these were baatezu users of learnt magic that used the circuits normally reserved for innate spellcasting for its learnt magic, these effectively lost a number of innate abilities in exchange for learnt magic. Fourth, the so-called augmented ones, these were the true geniuses among the baatezu where spellcasting was concerned. They lost nothing to cast their learnt magic and gained the ability to exchange their innate ability with weaker ability but similar abilities, increasing their versatility.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>It was rare for a baatezu to be religious and even then the 'faith' consisted more of a pact between the deity and the baatezu to gain power and where piety had no place. As the Lords of the Nine could not grant divine spells, those devils who would be priests had to be specialty priests of lawful evil deities like Bargrivyek , Druaga, Inanna , or Set . However, owing to their divided loyalties, being a priest was not well-regarded in baatezu society and the higher a baatezu priest rose in the hierarchy, the more they had to give up their relationship with their god. Therefore, no baatezu above cornugon -status were priests. The majority were hamatulas and osyluths , and a scant few were cornugons. These were ambitious and cunning devils who could work toward both a god's goals and their own.</p>
<h3>Government</h3>
<p>The baatezu were governed by two groups. First, there were the noble baatezu. Second, there were the Dark Eight . The distinction between these two groups was where their competence lay. Day-to-day-life, education, and matters of the Blood War were part of the ministries that were run by the Dark Eight. Matters that were about governance of the entire plane of Baator and the individual layers of it were done by the nobles.</p>
<p>The institutions of the baatezu were present in every city of theirs and had also emergency protocol that determined how to proceed if one of their ministries got destroyed by the tanar'ri.</p>
<h3>Resting</h3>
<p>Baatezu hated having to rest, for it prevented them from working to advance further. Therefore, they tried to keep their resting time at a minimum. Furthermore, as mentioned above, baatezu could hold off their need to rest, high-ranking ones for literal centuries, at the cost of increased time for rest when they could not keep their needs at bay anymore. These extended resting times represented a serious danger for a baatezu for it was at its most vulnerable. Therefore, baatezu kept secret resting places that were not just hidden but also warded. The level of which grew with increased station of a given baatezu.</p>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>Common rumour held that baatezu could not leave Baator on their own for the Prime Material plane or any of the Upper planes . The reason for this was that high-ranking baatezu forged contracts with clauses that make baatezu stay and/or not enter certain areas and the vast majority of baatezu adhered to these pacts and did not trespass to areas they were contractually forbidden to. A group of baatezu that was always kept out of these contracts were the erinyes who were therefore free to go anywhere they wanted to.</p>
<p>Baatezu who broke these rules fell in one of the following categories. Those for whom breaking the rules meant that they could depose the superiors responsible for their punishment, those who were certain that they could deliver such great results with the act that it would absolve their breaking of the rules, those of chaotic and/or good outlook, or idiots.</p>
<h3>Summoning Baatezu</h3>
<p>Baatezu could be summoned from Baator. There were two ways to summon a baatezu. First, there was a way to summon a certain one. This was done by incorporating the name of the baatezu into the summoning magic. This created a pull for the named baatezu who was than called to the caster. Baatezu did not like being summoned in this way. The reason for this were either or both of the following. Being plucked out from Baator while they were working to fulfill some superior's orders meant they were eligible for punishment for shirking duties and they hated it. Being plucked out from Baator while they were working to fulfill one of their scheme thus preventing it from going to fruition, which was considered the gravest of insults by the baatezu, something they hated too. Baatezu who gave off the impression that they were not angry were lying for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The second way to summon a baatezu was to not incorporate a specific name into the magic. Casting summoning magic to summon a baatezu caused the creation of a so-called spell crystal in Baator. The spots where these crystals most likely appeared were known by the Minister of Mortal Relations. Baatezu were sent to these places to let themselves be plucked out of Baator. They were given jobs of what to do once they arrived at the caster's place. Usually, these jobs included an agenda but the summoned baatezu was left to its own devices when it came to how to pursue said agenda. Baatezu who were summoned in this way were considered to be the public face of Baator. In other words, when they did something that sullied Baator's reputation, they were punished by torture.</p>
<h3>Relationships with Mortals</h3>
<p>As a general rule, baatezu saw no intrinsic value in mortals. However, they saw a value in exploiting them for their purposes. The one group of mortals that were valued, at least to some degrees, were those with magical power. To keep tabs on every interaction between baatezu and mortals, the baatezu founded the ministry of mortal relations.</p>
<h3>Relationship with Deities</h3>
<p>Baatezu did not worship deities in the way mortals did. Normally, they did not worship deities at all. Their object of respect were the Dark Eight, the noble baatezu, and the Lord of the Nine. The rare cases who did, did so to gain power from a given deity, but never out of piety and even took steps to hide the fact that they were in a relationship with a deity.</p>
<h3>Baatezu on the Fugue Plane</h3>
<p>Some baatezu stayed on the Fugue Plane from the World Tree cosmology , where they tried to convince souls of the newly deceased to join their ranks by becoming lemures . Few took up the offer, but to some the prospect of a chance of advancing in baatezu society was preferable to the fate they expected in afterlife.</p>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>Baatezu economy worked differently from mortal ones. First, the most valued currency was not money. While it was viewed as a useful tool to tempt mortals into acting in evil ways but monetary wealth was not the normal measure by which a baatezu gained respect from its peers. The valued commodities/currency of the baatezu were larvae, magic, knowledge, and favors.</p>
<p>The shops that existed on Baator catered to travelers. Baatezu demand and supply was met in the following way: low-ranking baatezu were provided what they needed from the higher-ranking, while the latter took whatever they wanted from the former.</p>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>Baatezu architecture was designed to indicate a baatezu's degree of importance. It had spikes, protrusions, and blades as visual elements. Their cities' design was fairly uniform. The more important the building, the closer it's location to the city's center. The less important the building, the closer it's location to the city's fringe.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>Baatezu were not among the greatest of artists. This did not mean that they had no understanding of aesthetics or lacked inspiration. Their need to form patterns affected their artwork in detrimental ways. For example, when they composed a piece of music, it might start off as an inspirational piece. However, due to their aforementioned need to build in a pattern, the work of art was predictable, provided the listener could discern the underlying pattern. Few among the lower baatezu were allowed to engage in artistic endeavors.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>The baatezu spoke a lot of languages and could also communicate via telepathy . When they spoke among themselves, they used their own language, which was very complicated. For example, every station had its own language that was based on the same and the level of complexity of the language, as well as its ability to convey abstract concepts, increased with increased station. A baatezu generally knew its own station's language and those of the stations below it. Knowing the language of higher-ranking ones was a punishable offense.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<h3>Anatomy</h3>
<p>Dissecting a baatezu revealed that baatezu bodies had internal organs. These occupied positions that were quite similar to the positioning of corresponding human organs. However, there were a few differences between human and baatezu organs. For example, a baatezu gained heightened attunement towards planar matters through their highly developed pineal glands, increased combat abilities but also an aggressive personality from a big—up to triple the human's size—adrenal gland, greater endurance through longer muscles, extremely high short-term strength through an increased transmitting capability of fluids such as blood in the shorter muscles, and an increased ability to withstand and recover from physical blows through scaled internal organs. Baatezu blood's coloration changed depending on the atmosphere they were at the moment, its default color was black. One mystery about baatezu anatomy was their bones. These slightly metallic bones gave other people the impression that they were not grown but carved and gave people the idea that a baatezu's body was constructed.</p>
<h3>Sex</h3>
<p>A baatezu did not necessarily have sex organs. Exactly a third of a given species of baatezu had male organs, another exact third female, and the last exact third no sexual organs. Out of the two-third that had such organs, only the male ones were functional in the sense of being capable of producing offspring. There were only three exceptions, the lemures and nupperibos who were universally sexless and the Erinyes who were universally female. The sex of a given baatezu was chosen for it by its superior. The superior's choice depended on the promoted baatezu's performance record. When the superior got the impression that a given baatezu had to learn something about one or the other sex then it was turned into it on promotion. Therefore, it happened that a baatezu changed its sex or became sexless multiple times in its life. The one exception to this rule were the pit fiends who were allowed to make their own choice on being promoted to one and could change it on a whim. However, higher ranking devils lost this ability to change sex.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, only male baatezu were fertile. Because their women were infertile, baatezu offspring were always made with female members of other races. This was done out of two reasons. First, there was simple lust. Second and the more prevalent one, baatezu society encouraged spreading baatezu influence through increasing the number of people who had a baatezu in their ancestry, baatezu had real zeal to leave many children.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Baatezu had no need for sustenance. However, that did not mean that they did not eat or drink, it was something of a hobby of theirs and not a necessity.</p>
<p>Regarding food, in order of preference, a baatezu liked meat from a sentient creature, meat from a good sentient creature, and meat from creature for whom goodness was part of its being like it was case with devas or solars . Eating allowed a baatezu to add the life force of the eaten creature to itself. What a baatezu rarely did was eating a soul while the owner was still alive. They did this only, when the soul changed into a physical form after its owner's death, for example, when it turned into a larva. The reason for this was that baatezu viewed souls as a potential resource that would become available to them, if they managed its corruption. Therefore, eating it before the owner's death was viewed as a wasteful thing to do.</p>
<p>When baatezu drank, they did this from rivers and lakes of Baator that held fluids that were basically worthless for mortals. Baatezu could gain the effect of drinking not only through oral means, but also through taking in moisture from the air.</p>
<p>The only group of devil that never ate or drank were the nupperibos.</p>
<h3>Sleep</h3>
<p>Baatezu needed, if not to sleep, at least to rest. As a tendency, lower-ranking one required more frequent but shorter rests, while higher-ranking ones required fewer but longer rests. Higher-ranking baatezu could push themselves to operate without rest, this waking time could amount to entire centuries, but the more a baatezu pushed itself, the longer the required rest became when it could not hold off the need for rest anymore. As a rule of thumb, lower-ranking baatezu needed to dedicate a tenth of their time to rest.</p>
<p>During these rests, baatezu dreamt. These dreams had the expressed purpose to motivate the baatezu to work hard during its next active cycle. An odd thing about their dreaming was that baatezu could share their dreams with others. They basically uploaded their individual dreams to a collective baatezu dream and downloaded dreams from said collective. This instilled a sense of order in the dreaming baatezu. Drawing from the collective resulted in the dreaming baatezu experiencing a mental change due to the collective dream's influence while allowing it to influence others with its own dreams.</p>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>Baatezu changed their bodies through promotion. There existed two currents inside baatezu society regarding this process, those who wanted to tinker with it for to find out methods for improvement and conservatives who wanted to stick to proven methods. The former was a growing movement by the 14 th century DR , while the latter had a lot of high-ranking baatezu. Modifications that caused some changes gave the promoted baatezu new abilities but also slightly modified bodies, the differences were not big enough to be perceived by the untrained.</p>
<p>There were two types of these modifications, those that were species specific and those that could be applied to any species of the baatezu. In the latter category fell:</p>
<h3>Types of Baatezu</h3>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Baatezu claimed two things about their mortality. First, barring violent death, they could not die. Second, if they died, they were reincarnated back on Baator.</p>
<p>The former claims were considered for all purposes the truth. The latter was not entirely the truth. When a baatezu died on Baator, it was dead. When a baatezu died somewhere else, it depended on whether it had a say in being there or not. For example, a baatezu who was outside of Baator because of a superior's order, was considered to be there out of its free will and if it was killed there, it was dead. When they were somewhere else because of somebody, like another baatezu, summoned them, they reincarnated as a nupperibo on Baator.</p>
<p>Baatezu feared real death, because they had no clue what it meant. A dead mortal received some form of afterlife , but what a dead baatezu received, if anything, was not clear and that frightened them to no end.</p>
<h3>Reincarnation</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a baatezu that died on a plane other than Baator while being there not out of its will, was reincarnated on Baator as a nupperibo. "Not being outside of Baator out of its own will" also included being somewhere because it was summoned there and said summoning was instructed to be conducted by the summoned baatezu.</p>
<p>Baatezu, at least in high positions, gave others details-rich descriptions of themselves as nupperibos, so they could be found by their subordinates when they die and turned into nupperibos. On being found, they were turned into lemures and promoted back to their old position from there. However, this method had some problems. First, it was seriously thought that distinguishing one specific nupperibo from others was very hard for the baatezu themselves. Second, the process of re-promotion was not always done and a baatezu did not regain its memories as a high-ranking fiend until it was promoted to its former form and regaining the position without special treatment could take a lot of time. Third, it happened that the subordinates simply did not care about following the order to find their former superiors as nupperibos, leaving them to fend for themselves back to their positions. Despite these problems, baatezu found it more desirable than death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Stance towards History</h3>
<p>Baatezu made token shows of their reverence towards their supposed history but that was it. They generally did not really care about their race's past. What they cared about was their individual and planar past, isofar as how it would affect them, and the future.</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>The orgins of the baatezu were not clear. The baatezu themselves claimed that they were born from Baator itself with clear directives about what kind of baatezu should do what. This version claimed also that the baatezu were the oldest fiends. The version was contested by tanar'ri and yugoloths who both claimed the title "oldest kind of fiend" for themselves.</p>
<p>This version was notable for it was the version that was certainly not the truth. Who or whatever lived on Baator at first, they were not the baatezu. Leaving a soul alone on the lawful evil plane caused it to become a nupperibo , a member of the race that lived on Baator before the baatezu came from somewhere else replacing these creatures.</p>
