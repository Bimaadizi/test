<p>Lupercio was a tanar'ri demon lord called The Baron of Sloth who was associated with sloth and darkness. Lupercio was most often lazy and ignored both his realm and the creatures that surrounded him, only occasionally moving manically and without form before falling again into apathy. Lupercio extinguished all light within a 10‑mile (16,000‑meter) radius of himself and, as a result, shadow demons often fed on the shadows he produced.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Darkness constantly wrapped around Lupercio's body, rendering him impossible to see. But there were said to be three (or possibly four) signs of his presence: first, a demonic smile of sharp teeth glittering in the darkness; second, a basso, tittering laugh aweful enough to chill the blood of slaadi; and thirdly, his immense strength. The fourth sign, if there was one, was unknown.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Lupercio ruled the 128 th layer of the Abyss , Slugbed .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
