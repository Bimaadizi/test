<p>Rechel was a tiefling of Elturel who was among those kicked out of the city in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rechel had dark-red skin, black hair, and two large horns that curved backwards like those of a ram . She dressed in simple clothes, a tunic and trousers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like other Elturian tieflings, Rechel was outcast from the city following the Descent in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . When the people of Elturel witnessed the horrors of the Nine Hells firshard, it was decided that any "devilkin" would be forced out of the holy capital. Many of the tieflings fell under the leadership of Zevlor , who led them west along the Risen Road towards Baldur's Gate . Unfortunately, goblin raids forced the refugees to seek shelter at the Emerald Grove , inadvertently endangering the druid's within their own home.</p>
<p>As tension grew between the druids and their tiefling guests, Rechel become more and more frustrated. She was among those that felt the selfishness and callousness of head druid Kagha would be the death of her kind.</p>
