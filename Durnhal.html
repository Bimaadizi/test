<p>Durnhal was King of Corwell in the Moonshae Isles during the mid-to-late 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He and his queen, Morgan , were the first human monarchs of Corwell to use the Great Bear as their standard, making them the forebears of the Kendrick family.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Durnhal came to rule Corwell following the end of the long rule of the Hugh Dynasty 's last regent, Cedric Riker , in the Year of the Weeping Kingdom, 272 DR . At this time, many of the lords of the Ffolk squabbled amongst each other rather than follow the High King, and King Durnhal was among those lords who were less cooperative, inviting antagonism from High King Gwylloch .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Wrathful Revenant, 295 DR , King Durnhal and Queen Morgan were captured by Gwylloch's son, Price Ketheryll , and his Doomed Legion . They were accused of high treason, and then executed alongside other captives at the Castle of Skulls . Ketheryll kept their gold signet rings as trophies.</p>
<p>Over a millennium later, tales and legends still recalled the royal couple, and speculated that their deaths had been the catalyst for the curse that ultimately befell Prince Ketheryll. In the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR , the halfling adventurer Pawldo and his companion Stefanik entered the Castle of Skulls seeking treasure. They escaped with the lost royal signet rings, and planned to gift them to High King Tristan Kendrick and his queen, Robyn Kendrick .</p>
