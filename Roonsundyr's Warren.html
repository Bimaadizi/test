<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Roonsundyr's Warren was the private residence of one of Skullport's most reclusive figures, the eccentric archmage Othur Roonsundyr . Roonsundyr did not receive visitors under any circumstances. He typically emerged from his sanctum no more than once or twice per month. On such occasions, he frequented the Trade Lanes, conducting transactions with gemstones as currency . Upon completion of his business, he returned to his residence, transporting his purchases through the air by magical means.</p>
