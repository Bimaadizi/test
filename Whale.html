<p>Whales were the largest mammals in the world.</p>
<h2>Types of Whale</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Society</h3>
<p>Whales were intelligent enough that they had devised their own calendar system, known as Whaletime .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Whales inhabited Patzcoatl , the Western Ocean of Maztica . Over height different species of them could be found in the deeper waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars, beyond the northern coasts and the Pirate Isles .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>All whales shared a common language. Referred to as Whalesong , it was a pure-sound language that was difficult for the majority of humans, demihumans, and humanoids to emulate or understand.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Whales were sacred to the elven god Deep Sashelas and the deities Istishia and Valkur .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The bodies of whales were highly valued by surface dwellers for a variety of purposes. Whalebones were used in creation of corsets , particularly the corsets popular among the overly-fanciful noble women of the Blade Kingdoms . Whale oil was used as a type of lamp oil on the western shores of Maztica. And whales were commonly hunted for a waxy substance within their stomachs known as ambergris , that was used for creating various aromatics and perfumes .</p>
<p>In Maztica, whales were hunted by the Metahel tribes that lived along the shores of Patzcoatl.</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>Sea mages could use the spells summon monster VI to summon 1-3 narwhals. With summon monster VIII they could call upon 1 or 2 gigantic whales. Clerics of Deep Sashelas could summon a couple of whales with their spell Summon cetacean depending on what whales were within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) when the spell was cast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , many scholars in the Heartlands insisted that very few whales existed within the Sea of Fallen Stars due to its relatively small size. Though those who lived within that body of water attested that many could be found within its deeper waters.</p>
