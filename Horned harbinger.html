<p>Horned Harbingers were those followers of Myrkul who continued to practice their faith following the god's demise during the Time of Troubles . They were all unique in the fact that in one point of their life or another, they have each touched the artifact known as the Crown of Horns , which carried the essence of the "deceased" Myrkul.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>These morbid individuals often dwelled in massive catacombs, spending their time lurking around cemeteries or old fields of battle.</p>
<p>They surrounded themselves with undead and spent little time interacting with the living. Many of their kind pursued lichdom .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Horned harbingers grew a circlet of horns out of their head, which somewhat resembled the Crown of Horns .</p>
<p>Over time, harbingers developed a number of powers related to death and the undead. They were granted the use of magic from the Death domain , learned how to reanimate dead bodies over long distances, and could both rebuke as well as create undead creatures. As they grew in power, harbingers gained control over more and more undead thralls at a rate unknown to typical clerics .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Myrkul died in Waterdeep during the Time of Troubles, in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , his remaining divine essence found its way into the Crown of Horns , which was hidden away in Blackstaff Tower . Over the next decade, Myrkul managed to teleport the crown across the Realms, placing it upon the heads of many of his former devotees, both living and otherwise.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Nearly all of the horned harbingers were divine or arcane spellcasters , and a large number of them were necromancers or even undead . While some of them had begin to worship other deities associated with death, such as Jergal , Cyric , and even Kelemvor , they all returned to the worship of Myrkul.</p>
