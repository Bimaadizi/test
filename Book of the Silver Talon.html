<p>The Book of the Silver Talon was the personal spellbook of the feared archmage Asmiak .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Asmiak's workbook was a black, leather-bound tome that held 25 pages made of papyrus. The edges of the pages had been painted red, a detail that was visible whether the book was closed or open. Inlaid into the front cover was a small claw, or talon made of silver but it had no outward marks of ownership.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, the Book of the Silver Talon was used by its author Asmiak as a workbook, during his apprenticeship
to the wizard Thurl . It is unknown how it slipped from his possession, but the book exchanged hands many times in the years to follow. Many of the mages who temporarily possessed the book have died at the hands of Asmiak's agents, in his attempts to reacquire his stolen volume.</p>
<p>One such mage was Casimur , who was slain by a group of gargoyles on Asmiak's command. After they recovered the tome, the gargoyles flew east across mountains and deserts towards the home of Asmiak. When they passed over the High Forest , they soared to rest and were shot down by a volley of silver arrows . The book however was not recovered by the elven archers and would wind up in the stewardship of another mage.</p>
<p>The Book of the Silver Talon was next known to be in the hands of the magician Phandal , after finding it in a bazaar. He in turn traded it to the thaumaturgist Alphon , who wound up fleeing from numerous goblin raids upon his home. Next in possession was the druid Rairun "Blackbrow" , who shipped it in a caravan to a colleague, only to learn of that caravan vanishing in the moorlands. It was next found by the adventurer Shoon , who brought it with him to Waterdeep . Shoon traded it to the merchant Deragus , who lost it when his shop was robbed by the master thief Dunas . Its next owner or owners were unknown and as of 1359 DR the spellbook was still unaccounted for.</p>
