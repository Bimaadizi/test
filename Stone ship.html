<p>Stone ships were stone sailing vessels made by the dwarves of Delzoun , which composed its navy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The stone ships were as their name indicatesâ€”colossal galleys made of stone. They were used by the dwarves of Delzoun for both trade and war.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Throughout the time period of the Netherese Empire , up to 20 stone ships were docked at the port of Ascore , with about 30 more at sail on the Narrow Sea . Across the Bay of Ascore , Ascore's stone ships traded with the Netherese at Coldfoot , Harborage , and Zenith .</p>
<p>After the Fall of Netheril , the magic of the phaerimm quickly dried up the Narrow Sea. Dozens of stone ships within the Bay of Ascore ran aground, and the crews had to be rescued by smaller vessels. The massive vessels were abandoned.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the remains of the stone ships could still be found in the ruins of Ascore, half-buried in sand east of the old docks.</p>
<p>By the late 15th century DR , two blue dragons , Anaxaster and Chezzaran , who were children of the infamous dragon Iymrith , had made separate lairs within a couple of the abandoned stone ships in Ascore's harbor.</p>
