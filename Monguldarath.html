<p>Monguldarath was a small fortified keep of stone that belonged to Tethyrean Counts of Fyraven over the years, and its lands included outlying farms.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Monguldarath was built atop a ridge just five miles southeast of the town of Tulmene , overlooking the waters of the Firedrake Bay . Surrounding the keep and its farms were groves of duskwood trees .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The masters of Monguldarath offered lodgings and hot meals to small traveling bands of adventurers within the keep's guesthouse and a private paddock and stables.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>However, those guests brandishing unsheathed arms or weaving potent magics resulted in a dozen Tulmene 's mounted men-at-arms summoned via a signal horn in addition to the keep's garrison of ten and half a dozen servants, experienced in battle and warfare.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Reclamation Wars , by the late 14 th century DR , Monguldarath received a new master – Seas' Admiral of Tethyr Tanar Keelson . Under his ownership, the keep was mostly inhabited by his servants, who worked on renovations as the admiral was away most of the time.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Like many placed in Tethyr, Monguldarath was rumored to be haunted by phantoms of the Ten Black Days . Volothamp Geddarm confirmed the keep's undead inhabitants in his guide to the Lands of Intrigue . According to the author, ghosts of silently moving ghostly forms of armed people proved to be no problem to Count Tanar Keelson and his servants, who got used to the haunting.</p>
