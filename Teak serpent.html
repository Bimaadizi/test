<p>Teak serpents , or teak snakes , were a type of huge constrictor snake found only in the vast jungles of the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara , specifically in parts of the jungle with teak or ironwood trees.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Teak serpents could reach lengths exceeding 30 feet (9.1 meters). Their hardened scales resembled those of the hardwood trees they inhabited, providing them with protection and natural camouflage.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Teak serpents preferred to surprise their prey by dropping on it from above with a combined attack involving a bite and constriction. Given their size and strength a teak serpent was capable of constricting up to three human -sized creatures at the same time.</p>
<h2>Habitat/Society</h2>
<p>Teak serpents were feared predators in their natural habitats. Their preferred prey item was a baby elephant , but they would consume anything they could overpower. They would typically sleep for a week after feeding.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These serpents ate live prey appropriate for a snake of their size. Their scales were harvested to add protective bonuses to the barkskin spell. Teak serpents were also captured by kahins and bound into magical staves .</p>
