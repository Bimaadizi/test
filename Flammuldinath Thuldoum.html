<p>Flammuldinath "Firefingers" Thuldoum was a mage in Thentia in 1367 DR and in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of 1373 DR , to Taegan Nightwind , Firefingers looked like "some fortunate child's doting grandfather"; he was stooped, wrinkled, had a white beard, and wore robes of scarlet, orange, and gold. Even though he carried himself as a venerable wizard, his garb could be described as an eccentric blend of reds, yellows, and oranges. Many could feel his impressive arcane powers. They were so potents, the wizard radiated almost palpable power.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Firefingers was the teacher of Maganus . He came to him just before the Time of Troubles ; the tutor found him even then wizened before his years and full of anger. The sorceresses Jannatha Goldenshield and Baerimel Dunnath were also trained by him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Firefingers was one of the mages in Thentia assisting Karasendrieth 's party in decoding Sammaster 's notes about the Rage of Dragons in 1373 DR. He also may have told the Hero of Daggerford what he knew of Maganus that same year.</p>
