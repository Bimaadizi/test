<p>Terran was the language of creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth or those otherwise related to the earth in some way. Many earthsoul genasi learned the language as well. When written, it used the Dethek script.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Terran is a rumbling language with deep tones that reverberate through the listener.</p>
<p>It was considered a dialect of Primordial , so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as Aquan , Auran or Ignan could understand Terran and vice-versa.</p>
