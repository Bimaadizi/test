<p>Ghostwise halflings , also called ghostwise hin , were the least common of Toril 's three major halfling subraces.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ghostwise halflings were similar in size and weight to other halfling types, with males being 2 feet and ​10 inches​ to ​3 feet and ​6 inches (0.86​ to ​1.1 meters) in height and 33​ to ​38 pounds (15​ to ​17 kilograms) in weight, while females were 2 feet and ​8 inches​ to ​3 feet and ​4 inches (0.81​ to ​1 meter) in height and 27​ to ​33 pounds (12​ to ​15 kilograms) in weight.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A defining characteristic of the ghostwise hin was their devotion to their clan and their near-obsessive respect for familial bonds. They were, also as a whole, wary and reclusive, and experienced less wanderlust than other halflings, keeping their wanderings confined to their forest territories.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ghostwise halflings were largely similar in abilities to other hin, although they were said to be less lucky. The ability that most set them apart was that all ghostwise halflings could speak telepathically with any person within 20 feet (6.1 meters). They could only speak and listen to one person at a time and could only make the link if that person shared a language with them. This form of telepathy was psionic in nature, and it was possible for individuals to learn to communicate with multiple people at once, and with people who did not have a shared language.</p>
<p>Most ghostwise hin favored training as barbarians , although rogues and rangers were also common. Most ghostwise spellcasters were druids and clerics , with only the rare sorcerer or bard , and wizards even rarer. Some few ghostwise warriors trained as warsling snipers . Individuals who chose to further develop their psionic gifts typically became psychic warriors or wilders .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Ghostwise halflings were very elusive and were generally isolated from the outside world. They often lived a nomadic life in clans. Those who left the clan often carried a token of some important natural feature in their clan's territory, such as a stone or a vial of water from a stream. Losing one's token was considered a sin and required an act of atonement assigned by the clan leader.</p>
<p>Ghostwise halflings worshiped Yondalla's Children , the halfling pantheon. Most of the tribes of the Chondalwood chose either Sheela Peryroyl or Urogalan as their particular patron.</p>
<p>The homeland of the ghostwise, as with all halflings in Faerûn , was Luiren , but very few ghostwise remained in that land, and those who did dwelt deep in the Lluirwood .</p>
<p>The majority of ghostwise hin, the descendants of those exiled from Luiren, had made the Chondalwood their adopted homeland. As of 1374 DR, the ghostwise halflings of the Chondalwood were known to be sympathetic to the cause of the Eldreth Veluuthra there. They also had an unspoken understanding with the tusk terrors of the Chondalwood had to stay out of each other's territories.</p>
<p>Ghostwise clans are also known to live the Methwood and the Forest of Amtar . As well as the Channathwood ; the tribes of that forest were notable for being the only ones known to trade with others, primarily the human farmers along the Channathwood's southern edge, though the two groups were by no means friendly.</p>
<p>More unusually, ghostwise halflings made up a full 7% of the population of the halfling city of Deepburrow , located in the northern reaches of Luiren on the surface and what was called Upper Great Bhaerynden in the Underdark . They primarily lived on the lowest layer of Deepburrow, the Deepingwander, where they were said to "seek the mysteries hidden in the depths".</p>
<p>Clans were known to turn to banditry.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Most ghostwise hin only learned the halfling language and Common , although their patriarchs and matriarchs would often learn one or two other languages such as Sylvan and Chondathan , while their druids were more likely to learn Sylvan or Gnoll . Almost all ghostwise halflings were illiterate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In times ancient and unrecorded, the land that became Luiren was an untamed wilderness home to three great tribes of hin, the lightfoots, the stronghearts, and the ghostwise, who sometimes feuded but mostly lived in peace with each other.</p>
<p>In −102 DR , however, an evil spirit came to the land and a cleric of the ghostwise called Desva came to lead the ghostwise hin. The ghostwise tribe turned to the worship of Malar and began to glory in violence and bloodshed; their hunters turned feral, painting their faces to resemble skulls and stalking the forests in search of other hin as prey. As Desva led them farther into evil, the cleric taught the strongest hunters to take the forms of werewolves and poisoned the natural predators of the land with insane bloodlust.</p>
<p>For a generation the Lluirwood was a place of death, but in −68 DR , the hunter Chand became war chief of the stronghearts and made an alliance with the war chief of the lightfoots. The two tribes united to search out and destroy ever ghostwise lair and stronghold; entire villages were ruined in the fighting as Chand held to his purpose and no hin warrior gave mercy nor stayed their hand. This lasted for three years until −65 DR , when Chand finally slew Desva, ending what was later called the Hin Ghostwars .</p>
<p>The ghostwise tribe, however, was decimated in the fighting and most of the survivors were exiled from the Lluirwood for their crimes; only the handful that had forsaken Desva and joined Chand's warriors were allowed to remain. The exiles migrated to the Chondalwood, where they settled and took an oath to never speak until they had atoned for what they had done.</p>
<p>In 1264 DR , the druid Voolad Espiral led an army of dark trees and other monsters in a surprise attack on the city of Thruldar , ultimately razing it to the ground and killing most of the inhabitants. Ghostwise tribes in the nearby forest noticed the evil magic involved and investigated. Upon discovering Voolad's doings they launched an attack of their own, killing Voolad and, when the dark power he served raised him as a ghost, sealing him and his army inside the ruined city with powerful spells. They subsequently kept guard of the ruins in hopes of discouraging pesky adventurers that might release the caged evil.</p>
