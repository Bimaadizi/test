<p>The Tears of the Dragon were artifacts created when the gold dragon Tlanchass wept for Archveult Tattercloak the wizard in 1294Â DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each tear was a clear object of unknown composition, apparently indestructible, roughly the size of a hand, and with a silky feel and a teardrop shape. They gathered and stored light, releasing a faint, minty-green luminence at all times. They released a ringing note when struck or dropped; it was so sad, it moved even an archmage who knew nothing of their story to tears.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As per Azuth , those carrying a tear were protected against any effect that drained their life energy, or possessed them, or that threatened to shock their system to the point of death.</p>
<p>The tears were known to, on contact, heal insanity and other damage to the mind; revert scarring and disfigurement; end diseases , even those such as lycanthropy and mummy rot ; break mental influences from spells ; and heal large amounts of damage every time. Once a tenday , they could act as a potion of vitality . Once a year per being, they could be used to contact their patron deity , and commune for up to five answers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Tlanchass wept over Raven's Bluff for the death of her beloved, Archveult Tattercloak, in the Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR , the tears were found on the ground, sparkling and gleaming, as bright as diamonds . Within a day, however, the mage Muaralygrym sent his gargoyles out across the city and had them snatch every single one of them. This act earned him the attention of Inhil Lauthdryn , the Magister at the time, who sought him out and battled him; neither was seen again after their fight, with the next Magister, Aralagath Tarsil , confirming their deaths.</p>
<p>However, Azuth was known to have shown a tear to a later Magister. Seventy tears were thought to exist.</p>
