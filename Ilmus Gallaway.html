<p>Ilmus Gallaway was a merchant living in Caer-Dineval during the 11th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During Eleint of the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Ilmus Gallaway sent a shipment of supplies to aid Easthaven in the coming winter for Gaspar , but the caravan was ambushed by an ogre raider and his orc henchmen.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Ilmus' business grew and the caravan routes expanded past Easthaven and Lonelywood . By the time the Gallaway Trading Coaster was established, it had trading depot across the Ten-Towns and traded with farther settlements such as Luskan and Shaengarne Ford . Subsequently, age and love for Cormyrian brandy caught up with Ilmus Gallaway and his family had to take over the business's daily activities and travel. Rawleigh Gallaway , Ilmus's son, guided the coaster to prosperity. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Ilmus's granddaughter who inherited his fiery personality and short temper, Deirdre Gallaway , was put in charge of the Gallaway Trade Depot in Targos .</p>
