<p>Rutherford Urmbrusk was the heir of House Urmbrusk in Waterdeep in 1479 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1476 DR , Rutherford's father, Quarren Urmbrusk , abandoned his duty in order to adventure in Undermountain , granting the control of the House to his sister Lestra Urmbrusk and also granting her custody of Rutherford. Secretly, Lestra bribed Quarren's companions in order to make sure that he never came back from the dungeon.</p>
<p>However, in 1479 DR , a voice like Quarren's started whispering Rutherford's ears. Believing his father to be alive, Rutherford gathered some companions—a half-elf mercenary, Zarr ; an elf wizard , Aizel ; a halfling rogue, Enda ; and the half-orc fighter brothers Squam and Rotwile —for a rescue mission. However, Rutherford also disappeared and his uncle hired an adventuring party to find him or his remains.</p>
