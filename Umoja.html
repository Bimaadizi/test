<p>Umoja was a druid devoted to Ubtao , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Umoja viewed life as a maze, constantly looking for the best path through it. Many considered him strange and cryptic, yet confident.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The druid carried a unique enchanted sickle â€“ Umoja's Harvester , and a set of magic hide armor .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dinosaurs were known as Ubtao's Children, and as a devote follower, Umoja always attempted to calm those that tried to attack the people he traveled with rather than fighting them. His animal companion was deinonychus named Yushai . Umoja treated the beast with gentle care and affection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike many other Tabaxi druids of Ubtao who rarely ventured far from their home city of Mezro , Umoja found himself guided by his deity's will to the neighboring nation of Samarach in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . Ubtao's visions were targeting the new interloper deity Zehir , rising along with his yuan-ti minions. For a while after his arrival, the Tabaxi was able to gain entry to the city of Samargol , where he waited for the god's further guidance while he made a living through divine healing magics.</p>
