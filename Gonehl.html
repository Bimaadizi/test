<p>Gonehl was a senior member of the Unseen in Waterdeep in 1370 DR and 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Gonehl, under his alias as "Aquila Gerallin", led the Masquerade , a mercenary information network based outside of Waterdeep. The Masquerade, to all outside Gonehl and Hlaavin , looked like a honourable group without a hidden agenda, but in truth they had infiltrated the governments of Amn , Sembia , and Westgate , plus several mercenaries companies. The Masquerade was actually the secret army of the Unseen.</p>
