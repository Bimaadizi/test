<p>Hauzz Tr'arach was a drow matron mother in the early 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hauzz ruled House Tr'arach in Menzoberranzan , a small house. She plotted to one day elevate her eldest daughter to the Ruling Council .</p>
<p>In 1018 DR , Hauzz with her elder children Daungelina Tr'arach and Duvon Tr'arach planned an attack on House Simfray and after being reassured about the wizards they had hired from House Xorlarrin and about the presumably very talented Simfray weapon master Zaknafein , the matron mother ordered the attack.</p>
<p>After the attack failed completely, Hauzz together with her youngest daughter Dab'nay Tr'arach protested about the failure with Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin , who informed her about the survival of Duvon. However, it was Zaknafein disguised as Duvon who arrived at the House Tr'arach complex and quickly killed Hauzz.</p>
