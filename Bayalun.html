<p>The Lady Bayalun was the step-mother, and later wife, of Yamun Khahan . She was also a talented wizard .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Apart from being a quite talented wizard Bayalun was also a master of deceit, finding it very easy to manipulate into beling she was their friend. Duping many people, she didn't let much stand in the way of getting her whatever she decried.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She wielded a staff of withering and wore both a ring of resistance , and a heavily enchanted cloak of protection .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bayalun was half- Maraloi , being the daughter of a Maraloi woman and a human man. She grew up among them but married into the Tuigan people when she married Burekai Khan , father of Yamun. Her half-elven heritage meant that she looked far younger than the actually was, being over a hundred years old when Yamun succeeded his father.</p>
<p>She ended being the step-mother of Yamun Kahan and one of the most powerful individuals at Quaraband .</p>
<p>When Yamun killed his father during a battle, thus becoming the new khan of their tribe, she, as was custom, married Yamun, and afterwards called Eke Bayalun Khadun, Eke meaning "mother" and a way for both her and her new husband to distance themselves from each other.</p>
<p>Well-versed in the writings and philosophies of both Khazari and Shou Lung , Bayalun was a powerful asset on Yamun Khahan's councils. She explained the Shou systems to the great khahan so he could better prepare and organize his armies .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , Bayalun conspired with some high dignitaries of Shou Lung to kill Yamun and seize the throne for herself with help by General Chanar , but in the end Yamun survived the assassination attempt and decided to invade Shou Lung by breaking the Dragonwall . Bayalun was stripped of the khadun title and confined in a dead-magic zone room at Quaraband under control of Sechen Khan .</p>
<h2>Relashionship</h2>
<p>In 1359 Aghul Balai of the Tsu-Tsu was among the teachers, magical advisors, and agents of Bayalun. Aghul sought to convert Bayalun to The Way .</p>
