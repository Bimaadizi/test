<p>Esbre Felmorel was the lord of Castle Felmorel in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Felmorel was jovial, but vigilant.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was married to Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel , and was friends with the explorer and warrior Barundryn Harbright . He was a little less enthused about his other acquaintance, Thessamel Arunder . His castle employed a number of wizards , probably for combat, and more than a dozen warriors as guards.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Esbre Felmorel habitually hosted banquets in his castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He had faced at least one fiend at some point prior to 761 DR . Later, he came to be under spell-thrall from his wife Nasmaerae.</p>
<p>In spring of the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Esbre Felmorel hosted a banquet that was attended by Barundryn Harbright, Thessamel Arunder, and a mysterious wanderer, called only Wanlorn . The dinner led to many digressions about philosophy, history, and governance. The wandering Wanlorn was seeking a woman by the name of Dasumia , and Esbre briefly mentioned the Lady of Shadows who ruled lands to the east.</p>
<p>Nasmaerae tried to steal magic from a sleeping Wanlorn's mind that night. In response, Azuth warned her not to, and broke all her spells, including the one holding her husband thrall to her; he also informed her that if she tried to do any of that again, the means of her prying would be taken from her. Esbre immediately came to her with a dozen soldiers, and forced her to employ the spell again, most likely having been informed by Azuth himself as well. The spell required his chamberpot and a knife, which he had his soldiers provide. With the casting, her magic was shorn from her by Azuth's power. Lord Esbre then declared they'd worship Azuth in that house forevermore.</p>
<p>During the chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Esbre Felmorel's wizards were unable to cast spells; he was resolute to continue standing in force against all foes, though his wife was less sanguine about it.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>His feasts had a good reputation, and those who spoke of him in fear preferred to use his moniker of "the Mantimera".</p>
