<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Stone Mouth was a hefty stone pedant. It was carved to closely resemble a grotesque mouth of a gargoyle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When worn, the Stone Mouth became animated, as if part of a living creature. The amulet repeated the wearers' words in the language of gargoyles and margoyles ( terran ) when spoken in common (or any other language the user was familiar with), and when the amulet heard a response in terran, it did repeated them back in the user's native tongue.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Not much was known of this strange item. It was created at some point long before 1369 DR and left in an ancient dvarven tomb under Glim-Gardens in Myth Drannor. Centuries later, the item was recovered by the Veiled Ones . Taken from the undead hands of two shadows , a mysterious red-hued spectre who seemed to be waiting for the adventurers arrival, and two hungry ghasts . The Veiled Ones used the Stone Mouth to communicate with friendly gargoyles in the ruins of the city.</p>
