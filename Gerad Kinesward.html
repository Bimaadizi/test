<p>Gerad Kinesward was an apprentice scholar who lived in the city of Neverwinter during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gerad's mistress was Riftel Farsight of the Neverwinter Guard . Riftel believed Gerad would do well to gain some more practical experience in the field, and learn to get herself out of difficult situations such as those she sent her into.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , after the Siege of Neverwinter , Gerad was tasked with recovering Riftel's six elemental weevil specimens from Mount Hotenow after they had become lost. This meant going into the embattled River District of Neverwinter, and Gerad was terrified of Many-Arrows orcs and was forced to cower and hide in Pedlars Path. If an adventurer found her, she begged them to find and deliver the lost elemental weevils.</p>
