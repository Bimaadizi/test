<p>Viperfish were an uncommon predatory species of deep sea fish that could be found in the Sea of Moving Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Viperfish varied considerably in size. At their smallest they measured around 1 in (0.025 m) and a half, with the largest natural size being around 6 feet (1.8 meters). Some more monstrous specimens of this species were found to grow as large as 20 feet (6.1 meters) in length.</p>
<p>One of the most distinguishing features was the long, fang-like teeth that filled their large mouths. These teeth were designed so as to fold into their mouths with ease whenever a viperfish needed to close it, acting as bars to prison prey trapped and to prevent a viperfish from losing their grasp on any prey that turned out to be larger than they could reasonably handle.</p>
<p>These creatures were also distinguished by the bio-luminescence emitted by circular spots along dual rows on either side of their bodies, as well as by patches within their mouths. And the whip-like growths that protruded from the area of their head analogous to a chin. A select view viperfish were noted as having special whip-like growths that functioned similarly to tentacles, allowing them to constrict their prey.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These fish sensed where they were going both by sight, aided by their bio-luminescence, and from their whip-like growths. These growths acted sort of like antennae, extensions of their lateral senses that could detect nearby movement within the ocean.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Viperfish were active hunters that preyed upon other unsuspecting creatures of the deep sea, luring them in with their bio-luminescence. They typically resorted to swallowing their prey whole. Attacking them to free captured prey was ill-advised, as doing so was more than likely to injure the prey as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over the years many attempts were made to study these peculiar fish alive, but these attempts mostly wound up fruitless as specimens tended to die less than half a bell after being captured. This continued to be the case as late as the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Viperfish typically lived solitary lives, only meeting with others of their kind briefly during mating season. Any eggs produced from pairings of viperfish were usually abandoned soon after being laid.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These creatures were a carnivorous species that sometimes tried to prey upon creatures larger than themselves.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The flesh of a viperfish was edible, though it was not particularly pleasant.</p>
