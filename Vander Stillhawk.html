<p>Vander Stillhawk was a human ranger of Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . He was a companion to Queen Zaranda Star before her ascension to the crown.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vander was tall, slender, and long-limbed, with hard muscles under dark and weathered skin. He had black hair that he grew long and bound at his nape, a broad jaw with ever-present stubble, and deep brown eyes, which sometimes looked like obsidian . He could be considered handsome, if one liked the tall, dark, and brooding sort. Vander could not speak, as but rather communicated through elven hand signals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Vander was a boy, orcish raiders cut out his tongue, leaving him mute.</p>
<p>He was raised by the elves of the Elven Woods . The elves not only trained him in use of the bow, but also in elven hand signals, allowing him to communicate with others.</p>
<p>He became a companion of Zaranda Star during the Reclamation Wars of Tethyr.</p>
<p>In the battle for Zazesspur in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Vander was slain. Yet Shield of Innocence , an orog paladin of Torm , beseeched his god to restore Vander to life, before he sacrificed himself.</p>
<p>Afterward, Vander attained high position in the court of Tethyr, which grants him many titles: Monarch's Champion, Regent of Prince Coram Rhindaun , and leader of the Warriors of the Star . The former title placed him in charge of the monarchs' safety as the Warriors were the personal guard of Queen Zaranda Star and King Haedrak III . He was also one of the Queen's Councilors. Prince Coram even received his name, Vander.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He carried a magical elven +1 longbow , as well as a longsword and a clip-bladed hunting knife. His arrows were fetched with black feathers.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As well as being able to use any kind of bow , Vander possessed an innate magical power to repair a damaged arrow simply by running his lips along the shaft.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like most rangers, Stillhawk despised entering a city, preferring to remain in nature. His expression was almost always grim.</p>
