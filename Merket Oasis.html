<p>The Merket Oasis , also known as the Merket Depression, was a large valley located in the Quoya Desert in the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike a typical oasis, the Merket Oasis was not green or very rich in plant life. However, due to most of the streams in the Quoya Desert draining into it , the area had more plant life than the rest of the desert.</p>
<p>The area was well known in Shou Lung for its vineyards and melons . The grapes grown here were made into sweet wines , and fine raisins, popular at the banquets of the nobility.</p>
<p>Despite being outside the Dragonwall , and the borders of Shou Lung, the empire kept a magistrate and a small garrison in the region, at the town of Kwachow , in order to protect the valuable foods grown here.</p>
