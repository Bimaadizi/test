<p>Summertongue , also known as Felthann and Liluth's Summertongue , was a magical sword that once belonged to Liluth and was one of the treasures in the Vault of Ages in Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Said to cut darkness, it was a powerful magical +3 longsword that destroyed shadows at a touch and struck thrice as hard as normal against other non-corporeal undead such as wraiths , spectres , ghosts , watchghosts or vampires in gaseous form .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Summertongue was stored within the Vault of Ages as of 241Â DR . It was considered "old" by the elves even then. Elminster passed on it when he searched the vault with the Srinshee at that time. It and the other treasures were not seen after the Weeping War and Myth Drannor's fall in 714 DR , and were thought to still lie in the Vault.</p>
<p>However, much later, Summertongue , known then as Felthann , resurfaced in Impiltur . It was acquired by Mage Royal Soargar and stored in his tower in Lyrabar as part of his mission to preserve the treasures of Old Impiltur as the realm fractured. Summertongue was one among a hundred or so magical weapons in the collection known as Soargar's Legacy . In the Year of the Dawn Dance, 1095 DR , Soargar granted the collection to Imphras I in anticipation of when the monarchy in Impiltur would be reestablished, two years later. Summertongue and the rest of the weapons were shared among Imphras and his loyal battle companions, who later became his Royal Guard .</p>
<p>However, Summertongue and the other enchanted weapons were lost when King Imbrar I led the Royal Guard against the hobgoblins of the Giantspire Mountains in the Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR , and the whole force vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>Othiiyr Velthrann , a sage from the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast , made his life's work the study of the magic swords of Soargar's Legacy. Othiiyr recorded the legends around them, and pieced together the history of Summertongue and the other blades. Othiiyr assisted the Knights of Imphras II in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargar's Legacy. The whereabouts of Summertongue remained unknown as of 1374 DR , but the Knights were working to recover it.</p>
