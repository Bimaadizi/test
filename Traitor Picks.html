<p>Traitor Picks experienced a brief period of notoriety when Gilliam recruited a well-regarded gourmet chef from Waterdeep . The chef, Percival Gallard Woodehouse , was hired to elevate the tavernâ€™s culinary reputation. However, following an unscheduled expedition into the Underdark in the company of the notorious Volothamp Geddarm , Woodehouse returned to discover that his employment had been terminated. Gilliam had voided his contract and liquidated his possessions to cover the cost of hiring a replacement cook.</p>
