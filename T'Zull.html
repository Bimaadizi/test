<h2>History</h2>
<p>The snakey fellow suddenly appeared with Nepri , Thulkaan , and more fire elementals inside the soon-to-be Burning Library after being dragged from its home plane by the malfunctioning mythal in 1374 DR . It set the cold, non-burning library ablaze out of obligation, to the great distress of the guardian electrum dragon Jurin'ildren and the librarian Kaylie .</p>
