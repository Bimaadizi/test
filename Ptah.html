<p>Ptah was a god who was a master of planar travel and could teleport anywhere in the multiverse with accuracy. He was the only deity native to the Ethereal Plane .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ptah was summoned by Lord Ao and asked to carry a message to the deities on the home world of the Mulan , inviting them to create powerful avatars that could accompany Ptah to Realmspace where their people had been taken, bypassing the barriers put up by the Imaskari . Most of them agreed to make the sacrifice and the journey, so Ptah led the way using an artifact known as the Beacon of Light . Thus the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons came to Toril , landing on what was later called the Godswatch Mountains .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>In the Outlands a sprawling, richly decorated and well-staffed temple of Ptah stood within The Lady's Ward of the city Sigil .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some legends claimed that Ptah's existence predated that of the Mulhorandi deity Ra , but he stepped down to let him take on his role.</p>
