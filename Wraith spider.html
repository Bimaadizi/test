<p>A wraith spider was a type of undead giant spider .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Appearing much like the monstrous spiders that they were in life, wraith spiders differed in a few noticeable ways. A wraith spider's eight eyes were nothing more than hollowed-out sockets and a shadowy aura emanated from the undead vermin , congealing around the fangs as pure blackness. They were surrounded by the stench of decay.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Wraith spiders attacked and hunted in the same manner as their living counterparts. However, their venom glands were replaced with strength-sapping and life-draining negative energy .</p>
<p>Although they could not spin webs in undeath, wraith spiders still possessed the heightened sensitivity to vibrations and tremors that most spiders had.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>They were formed from the husks of giant spiders and animated as an undead by malevolent spirits from the domain of Kiaransalee .</p>
<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>Wraith spiders were known to haunt the swamps of the Lizard Marsh on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR , cultists of the drow deity Kiaransalee transformed many of the spiders living in settlements such as Maerimydra and Szith Morcane into wraith spiders as twisted mockeries of Lolth's sacred creatures.</p>
