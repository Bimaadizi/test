<p>Climbing irons were leg attachments used to make climbing wooden surfaces easier.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Climbing irons were metal rods that attached to the lower leg. A barbed ankle spike could be forced into a tree or wooden structure while climbing to ensure a steady platform for the feet. Many rogues used these to scale wooden building in cities.</p>
<p>The drawback of using climbing irons is that the wearers movement speed while on flat land was reduced by roughly 1/4.</p>
