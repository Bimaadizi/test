<p>Nylas Jowd was a Red Wizard of Thay who lived within Undermountain during the 15 th century DR . He was a student at the magic academy known as Dweomercore , located within the dungeon-complex far beneath the city of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like the other Red Wizards, Nylas wore red wizards' robes and kept his head shaved bald. Also like his countrymen, he possessed a certain disposition towards malevolence and evil. Nylas was particularly interested in anatomy and tended to view the living as future corpses that could be manipulated with necromancy .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>As companions, the young wizard kept a pair of invisible will-o'-wisps that accompanied him throughout his journeys. While studying in Dweomercore, he kept a zombified ogre within his dormitory to protect himself and his belongings.</p>
<p>In his studies, Nylas drew the ire and cruelty of the "Horned Sisters" of Dweomercore, Turbulence and Violence . He sought to have them killed so that he could reanimate their bodies as walking undead .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Nylas's possessions was his personal spellbook , which was crafted from the wood of a coffin and the flesh of one or more humanoids . Its pages were inscribed with words written in Nylas's own blood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While he began his arcane studies in his homeland of Thay, Nylas eventually traveled west to Undermountain to study necromancy directly under the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak . Sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , he enrolled in the arcane academy, Dweomercore, accompanied by his will-o'-wisps.</p>
