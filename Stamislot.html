<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The keep stood in the rolling wilderlands to the northwest from the most northwestern end of the Snowflake Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the late 14 th century DR, the keep was run by the infamous "robber baron" Relve Stamislothar, the stronghold's namesake. With time, the keep came to be nothing more than abandoned ruins.</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, Stamislot was home of the Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot . The strange beast was slain by the mercenary and adventuring duo of Talarenne and the person who would later become known as the Hero of Daggerford . The friends battled the dreaded wyvern under the cover of the night during a storm. At one point, Talarenne pulled the Hero of Daggerford out of the creature's maw but missed the second head that bit Tala on her backside. Eventually, it was slain. The deed was done sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>The ruins of Stamislot still stood as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
