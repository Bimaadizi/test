<p>Moray was a kingdom that comprised the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles . During the events of the Spellplague , this realm collapsed when it was overrun and destroyed by lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moray was notably more impoverished than the other major Ffolk kingdoms of the Moonshaes. It's capital was located at Moray-town .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Moray imported armor and weapons from Callidyrr and horses , parchment , silk , and spices from Calimshan . It exported coal , furs , timber , and iron ore and other metals . The kingdom's mines were located in both the Trollclaw Range and the Orcskull Mountains .</p>
<p>Agriculture was present in the northern and eastern lowlands. Fishing grounds were notable only in the waters to the island's north.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The kingdom long contended against Northlander raids.</p>
<p>When King Edwin Carrathal II of Callidyrr died in the Year of the Petulant Dragon, 1135 DR , his widow, Queen Eleanor , invited the then-king of Moray, Adom Kimball , to serve as regent of Callidyrr. He thus ruled both Moray and Callidyrr until the Year of Eyes, 1141 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Snow Winds, 1335 DR , King Dagdar of Moray died while fighting Northmen shortly after hosting Elminster in his kingdom.</p>
<p>Dagdar's heir, King Dynnegall , would be the last of their line after he and his children were assassinated in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR . They were slain by assassins led by Razfallow on the orders of Cyndre .</p>
<p>Eventually, Moray was incorporated into the United Moonshae Isles in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR. Integration and intermarriage between the Ffolk and the Northlanders began to erode many of the differences between these peoples, and efforts by Northlander raiders to clear out the island's monsters brought an influx of Northlander settlers to the kingdom. Much later, following the kingdom's collapse, some would ultimately recollect Moray as a Northlander realm.</p>
<p>Following the rise of the fey of Sarifal on the nearby isle of Gwynneth in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , suspicion and hatred of any and all fey spread in Moray, especially after the fall of Caer Corwell . Around the time of the Spellplague, the humans of Moray hunted down and purged fey, elves , and even dwarves from much of the island. Also during the Spellplague, the Black Blood tribe laid siege to Caer Moray and tore down its walls, seeking to establish a lycanthrope homeland. The Ffolk largely abandoned the island following this conflict.</p>
