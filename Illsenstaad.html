<p>Illsenstaad ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ l ʃ ʌ n s t oʊ d d / ILL-shun-stodd ) was a stone giant and the second son of Obadai .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Illsenstaad spent much of his life creating the many friezes within Hotun-Shûl , having been charged by his father Obadai with documenting both the tangible and religious history of the giants .</p>
<p>Around the 10 th century DR , 400 years prior to 1366 DR , Illsenstaad was killed in his living quarters by one of the many earth elementals unleashed by grimlocks assaulting Hotun-Shûl.</p>
<p>Instead of passing on to the afterlife, Illsenstaad lingered in the temple as a ghost , his spirit tormented by the fact that he never got to finish carving the friezes for a room dedicated to the history of ettins and cyclopes .</p>
<p>He would spend the following centuries working tirelessly to carve runes into the large statue that laid in Hotun-Shûl's central rotunda, eventually transforming it into a rune-forged guardian to protect the temple.</p>
