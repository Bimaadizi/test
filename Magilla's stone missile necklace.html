<p>In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, the saru village, Magilla's home, fell under a wasting curse placed on it by a vain earth spirit of the Living Jungle named Ligela . The spirit was quelled by a group of adventuring tribesfolk, saving the lives of suffering saru. Magilla enchanted several items as a gift for the saviors. Magilla's stone missile necklace was among the magic items created by the shaman.</p>
