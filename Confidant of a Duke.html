<p>Confidant of a Duke was a book penned by Golbraith Stredivas , friend and confidant of Duke Abdel Adrian , published sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The recorded information in the Confidant of a Duke was a somewhat rambling account of a friendship between Abdel Adrian and Golbraith Stredivas. The two met after the Bhaalspawn became a Duke of Baldur's Gate and took on a habit of wandering the streets of the city incognito, wearing a hooded cloak . Abdel called it "taking the pulse of the town," and, as Golbraith supposed, this habit came from the Duke's humble upbringing among the scholars of Candlekeep .</p>
<p>During one such venture into the Lower City , Abdel met Golbraith at one of the terrace tables of the Elfsong Tavern . The two accidentally bought each other's drinks by calling the same waiter to them. The strangers stroke up a conversation, and when the Duke found out that Golbraith was an adventurer and a monster hunter, he showered the man with questions. On the next meeting, the Bhaalspawn revealed that he too was an adventurer once, and afterward, they met regularly at the Elfsong, turning conversations into a friendship. Many tendays later Golbraith realized that his new friend was the Grand Duke.</p>
<p>Finally, Confidant of a Duke continued on recording numerous meandering stories the men shared while sharing numerous tankards of ale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Confidant of a Duke could be found in the home of Golbraith Stredivas in the Gate's Lower City.</p>
