<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Raised a pirate, Calliope was easy to lose composure and give in to anger and use her sharp tongue and "colorful" language. Even so, she had a knack for celebrating, and liked to share her joy with her friends. She was prone to sudden moments of musical inspiration.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Calliope accumulated weapons and trinkets throughout her career, including several powerful magical items. Her weapon of choice was a rapier and sometimes she wielded a simple longsword . She owned several magical blades, such as the Eye of the Storm , the Heart's Splinter , the unique sword of riotous revels , and the mysterious Boris , the blade that had the face of her former teacher. Calliope owned a ring of battle , a pair of magical idle dice , an ioun stone of protection , and an enchanted spyglass called Squint .</p>
<p>Calliope's enchanted lute was her favorite and quite weathered magical instrument , from the neck of which dangled the seal of orchestration . She also owned several other magical lutes that she switched as the need arose: thw charming lute was aptly named for its ability to cast charm monster , and Basher was a deadly lute that allowed Calliope to instantly kill her opponents with one pluck of its strings.</p>
<p>On her head, Calliope wore a makeshift bandana she called Bonny , she sliced it off unsuspecting Mirt's coat. The bandana turned out to be a magical item with healing properties. On her feet, she wore the Keels , boots crafted out of metal parts of the ships she downed during her pirating days. Calliope had the Keels enchanted to give her the frightful presence .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Boris , a pirate captain who raised Calliope, was her mentor and the father figure.</p>
<p>Calliope could often be found in Waterdeep accompanied by her two best friends, a human rogue Hitch and a halfling fighter Skip Brickard . The trio gained some renown and was mentioned by Volothamp Geddarm in his book Dungeonology .</p>
<p>During her time working for the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Calliope worked alongside adventurers Coriolis , Farideh , Halbenet , Naomlen , Nayeli , Raika , Saarvin , Shevarith , and Tommus .

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Calliope was raised in the high seas aboard a pirate ship by a privateer only known as Boris. Accustomed to the fast life of danger and swashbuckle, Calliope continued adventuring long after leaving her pirate life behind.
