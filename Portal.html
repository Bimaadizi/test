<p>Portals were permanent teleportation effects that linked many places in and outside Toril , including other planes and planets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A portal was a two-dimensional area—often a circle with a radius of up to 15 feet (4.6 meters) but not limited to it in size or shape—that was both intangible and invisible. Because of this, a freestanding archway of some kind usually was built to identify the location of a portal , so those who could not detect magical auras did not stumble into them accidentally. It was impossible to visually find out a portal's destination. For example, sticking one's head into that field to find out the destination was impossible, for touching a portal activated it.</p>
<p>One way to find out the location of a portal was to cast detect magic . The magical aura of a functional portal was much stronger than that whose uses were completely exhausted. Finding out more about a portal required an analyze portal spell .</p>
<p>The portal itself was completely intangible. Portal finders were tools to find portals . A greater Underdark map also had the location of every portal within the mapped area.</p>
<p>Passing through a portal was described as an unsettling experience: space between the "fabric of the planes" was entirely dark, devoid of air and offering no sensation of temperature. Oddly enough, it seemed to elicit phantom scents, like the smell of wintergreen or stale wine .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Portals were magical transportation devices. When somebody touched the two-dimensional field, that person was affected by a greater teleport effect towards a pre-set destination. This was the reason why the "sticking the head through"-method to find out the destination failed. Creatures could enter and be transported by a portal , as long as they could pass through them, and objects could not. For example, one could not shoot arrows through a portal , they would not just not pass through, but bounce off. An exception to this no-object-rule were those objects carried by creatures passing through a portal . However, even this had a limit of 850 pounds (386 kilograms) and the definition of "carried" was anything touched. This weight limit had the peculiarity that an object that was touched by several creatures dropped the amount of objects the creatures could carry by its weight for all and not just for one. The limit on how many creatures could pass through a portal was the one that the builder set and the usual limit was as many creatures as wanted to pass through.</p>
<p>A portal could only send a person to its destination, but not back. Quite often, people built directly at the destination a second portal to effectively create a two-way- portal .</p>
<p>Destroying a portal was very difficult. Disintegrate or other physical means were not means by which a portal could be destroyed. Successfully using dispel magic could stop the working of a portal for up to twenty four seconds. It required a Mordenkainen's disjunction spell to turn a portal permanently non-functional. Another means was the gate seal spell. A tool to manipulate and glean information from portals was a staff of portals . A tool to destroy a portal was a portal demolisher .</p>
<h3>Special Portals</h3>
<p>There were some special types of portals :</p>
<h3>Malfunction</h3>
<p>A portal's magic was very durable, but it was subject to wear. Portals could also be influenced by global magical catastrophes. Such portals started to malfunction. Malfunctioning portals were generally a century or older. When such a malfunctioning continuous portal was activated, the portal could start to show its malfunctions and applied such effects for up to a minute. Possible malfunctions were that the portal did not apply a greater teleport but a greater dispel magic effect to either the user or the user's magic items . When the former happened, the target was the user and could lose magical effects he or she was benefiting from. When the latter happened, what the portal did was draining the magic items of magic to power itself, the magic items stopped working for a short time, when it came to charge-based magic items, they lost charges. Another effect that could happen was that the user was shoved off as though he or she suffered a telekinesis effect. Another possible effect was that the portal spilled either and inflict serious wounds or cure serious wounds out against the user.</p>
<p>Even when the portal sent somebody off, it could send somebody to a wrong place. However, about half the time, a portal worked properly and one could further stabilize it with a portal stabilization spell or by applying special portal -related stabilization skills.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The creation of a portal was formerly believed to require specific portal -knowledge, but it turned out that they could be created by anybody who could create wondrous items . However, having specific knowledge still helped to cut the costs of creation by half. The creation required one of the following spells: teleport , greater teleport , teleportation circle , or gate . It was also a very costly process. A default portal , meaning one-way, always active, and of 10 feet (3 meters) radius, cost 50,000 gp , a large part of the creator's personal essence, and one hundred days. When creating a portal , the creator needed to set a destination. Any place could be this destination, as long as it fulfilled two criteria. First, it needed to be a place where the creator had been at least once. Second, it needed to be a place where travel via the Astral Plane was possible, this was due to the nature of teleportation spells in general.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a so called two-way portal was actually not one portal but two portals , one being built on the other's destination point. Creating a second portal on the destination point cost half the amount of money to create the first one, more personal essence, and fifty days or more in time.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a standard portal was created with a 10 feet (3 meters) radius, but could be as small as 6 inches (15 centimeters) in radius. As a rule of thumb, portals that were bigger than the aforementioned 10 feet in radius cost more for every 300 square feet fraction by another 100% in monetary cost.</p>
<p>Turning a portal into an impassable one or keying and randomizing a portal incurred no additional costs, but adding more destinations than one increased the cost by a fourth for every additional destination, when it came to creature-only portals , the cost was actually doubled. Those creature-only portals that sent equipment and body to different destinations incurred costs like a creature-only portal with one additional destination and were very costly. When it came to nonliving-only portals , the cost was four times as high as a normal one. Turning a portal transparent cost a flat 50,000 gp.</p>
<p>The creation of a portal with limited number of usages was a cost-saving measure. A continuously active portal and one that could be used five times per day cost the same. It cost less as less frequently the portal could be used. A portal could be created to work even less frequently than once per day dropping the cost even further, but this had a limit. A portal that allowed travel once a tenday was the limit, portals that worked even less frequently could be still created, there was simply no saving regarding the costs.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>A lot of people created portals in Toril's history. Due to the durable nature of this magic , Toril had portals in the hundreds by 1372 DR . However, quite often, the purpose and usage instructions went lost over time alongside their creators. Therefore, portals were considered both mysterious and unpredictable.</p>
<p>Portals existed throughout the Underdark . Entire networks were the primary means people moved around in the Realms Below. Such a portal's location was often made clear by means of archways, columns, or simple stone piles, if it was part of a trade route. A site with a portal often had graffiti carved or written. Graffiti provided from time to time information about the portal's nature or its destination, albeit not always in a clear manner.</p>
<p>One group of people who sought the destruction of interplanar portals were the incantatars . They did not want creatures from foreign planes to enter their own and as such viewed it as their duty to destroy as many interplanar connections as possible. That said, they were a font of knowledge for portals in general. The existence of spells developed by mages from other planes like Otto's irresistible dance or Tenser's transformation was accredited to interplanar portals .</p>
<h2>Notable Portals</h2>
<h3>Elfgates</h3>
<p>The elfgates were portals that could teleport things to and from Evermeet .</p>
<h3>Bukhara Spires</h3>
<p>These were teleportation spires created by the Imaskari .</p>
<h3>Elemental Vortices</h3>
<p>Elemental vortices were pathways connecting elemental planes with one another or the Prime Material Plane .</p>
<h3>Shadow Portals</h3>
<p>A shadow portal was a naturally occurring portal like one of the vortices. The difference was that it did not connect to one of the Inner Planes but to the Shadowfell . Technically, these were simple planar holes towards the Shadowfell and not portals , but they worked like portals . About four-fifths of them were two-way portals and the other one-fifth were one-way portals They were always active and did not need to be specifically activated. They were a specific feature of the Lowerdark and were more common the deeper one went.</p>
<h3>Time Gates</h3>
<p>Much rarer than normal portals, a few time gates existed throughout Faerûn. They were physically similar to other portals, but transported an individual not through space, but into a different time.</p>
<h3>Weavegates</h3>
<p>A weavegate looked and behaved similarly to a regular portal, unless the user knew how to navigate the Weave . For such users, the weavegate could be used to reach any other portal reached by the Weave, instead of the pre-set destination. Traveling in this way gave the sensation of gently falling through a glowing blue void.</p>
