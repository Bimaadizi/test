<p>A beholder mage was a beholder which was blind in its central eye—thus lacking its innate antimagic powers—and had taken advantage of this circumstance to train as a wizard . They were one of two kinds of beholders which could cast arcane spells , the other being elder orbs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The distinguishing feature of a beholder mage was its blind, destroyed, or missing central eye. While some made an effort to hide this deformity, others proudly displayed their ruined eye or the wound or disease which had rendered it useless.</p>
<p>Most beholder mages were a bit smaller than the average beholder.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A beholder mage used its dead central eye as a spellcasting focus , and was able to cast spells by wiggling and writhing its eyestalks and singing a spellcasting song. A beholder mage was able to sing songs of such complexity that they could juggle the verbal components of several spells simultaneously.</p>
<p>Beholder mages advanced their spellcasting by converting their eyestalks to "spellstalks". To learn spells of a new level, a beholder mage had to dedicate an eyestalk to becoming a new spellstalk by permanently sacrificing the innate power of that eyestalk. Doing this granted the beholder mage the ability to cast more powerful spells and to do so without the need for material components . Beholder mages were so innately gifted with magic that they could simultaneously cast spells with each spellstalk. While they could sacrifice their eyestalks in any order they wished, most beholder mages chose to begin with their power to charm person and saved their most devestating powers—such as the ray to disintegrate —for their later sacrifices. After it had sacrificed its third eyestalk, a beholder mage gained the innate ability to summon a familiar , with many favoring the mini eyeball beholder. A beholder mage who had sacrificed all ten eyes could gain the ability to consume magic with its dead central eye: spells directed at the creature could be captured by the eye, which would glow red with the contained magical energy until the beholder mage made an effort to absorb and feed on that energy.</p>
<p>Beholder mages prepared spells in the same manner as a wizard and kept track of their spells with a spellbook , although their physical limitations meant that they needed either to have some form of telekinesis to manipulate this book—and some developed the ability to freely use mage hand for such tasks —or they needed charmed servants to hold it for them. That said, they were not as reliant on their spellbooks as normal wizards, and could "store" one spell in each spellstalk to be memorized later. There was no limit to the number of spells that a beholder mage could know or learn.</p>
<p>In some ways, beholder mages' spellcasting skills were more limited than a normal wizard. For instance, they were unable to learn spells that increased their capacity to memorize more spells—such as Rary's mnemonic enhancer —and some were unable to learn spells from more than one school of magic . They also tended to struggle with spells that took more than one minute to cast.</p>
<p>About one in ten beholder mages also had psionic abilities.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Beholder mages tended to be antisocial. Nevertheless, they were more willing to engage in diplomacy than the average beholder, although almost always with the intent to betray or undermine.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Depending on how many eyestalks had been dedicated to spellcasting, a beholder mage fought with a combination of wizard spells and their own innate powers. They took full advantage of their unique ability to cast multiple spells simultaneously.</p>
<p>If one of a beholder mage's spellcasting eyestalks was severed, the mage lost the ability to cast spells with it until the stalk could be regenerated.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The ancient and unique spellcasting techniques and traditions of the beholder mage were largely developed to overcome the innate physical difficulties of spellcasting without hands. In many cases, beholder mages developed their own spells to better suit their limitations, and many spells that looked familiar to normal wizards were in fact the product of efforts to duplicate those spells. Beholder mages were also among the few beholders who could create magic items , such as the Crown of Eyes .</p>
<p>The main prerequisite to becomeing a beholder mage was the loss of sight in a beholder's central eye. Most beholder mages had either been born blind, lost their central eye during battle, or were so ambitious that they intentionally put it out in order to study magic . Normal beholders tended to shun beholder mages, although others saw them as disabled and worthy of pity rather than ostracization. The necessity of sacrificing the powers of their eyestalks to cast spells was generally abhorrent to beholders, so very few were eager to take up the path of a beholder mage.</p>
<p>Major populations of beholder mages in Faerûn were found in the Underdark beholder cities of Ooltul , where the phaerimm Triumvirate had forcibly converted two hundred beholders into mages, and Zokir , where wizardry among beholders was discouraged but not forbidden.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Beholder mages could be found not only on Toril , but throughout Wildspace . They also seemed to be drawn to the extraplanar city of Sigil .</p>
<p>Some scholars believed that beholder mages had created the first gas spores .</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>The spellcasting eyestalk of a beholder mage could be substituted for a normal beholder eyestalk in any potion that called for that ingredient, but it would frequently result in unpredictable if not bizarre side effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the beholder mage spellcasters was unclear. Some scholars believed that the first beholder mages had likely been born blind, while others proposed the first was a mighty ancient beholder who lost its sight in a great battle, although the exact identity of this ancient beholder was debated.</p>
<p>In the Year of Craven Words, −350 DR , the phaerimm seized control of the beholder city of Ootul, precipiating the conversion of hundreds of beholders into beholder mages at their behest. They still controlled the city as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . By that time, both the phaerimm and the beholder mages of the city had independently developed a way to create mutant, miniature beholderkin .</p>
<p>Beginning sometime circa the 4 th or 5 th centuries DR, the hive mother Xraunrarr took up residence in the Underdark beneath eastern Cormyr and compelled many of her brood to become beholder mages. At some point, she warred with Hullack , a druid who would become the namesake of the Hullack Forest (which was then still part of the greater Cormanthor forest), but she was slain by one of her own: the beholder mage Uldeeth . The remaining beholder mages created an organization known as the Xraunrans , and as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , they were secretly manipulating Cormyrean society and had been doing so for centuries. Their aim appeared to be to ensure the status quo while secretly funneling riches and captives to themselves.</p>
