<p>The Thieving Ash was a supernatural tree grown by the Rotting Man , a servant of Talona , in the late 14 th century DR. He used this tree to capture the power of an aspect of Lurue and divert it for his own purposes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Likely an ash , the tree was over 100 feet (30 meters) in height, with an ovoid canopy of sickly leaves that dripped with a disturbing fluid. It had a twisted, blackened trunk, with a large, partially burst cyst at its base.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>The only known specimen of the Thieving Ash was in The Close in the Rawlinswood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Thieving Ash was used by the Rotting Man to steal away the power of Araluen , so as to turn her into the Step-Daughter of Talona . It was grown at some point after the Rotting Man captured Dun-Tharos in 1371 DR . A small fragment of Araluen's light managed to escape from the trap, creating Ash, a baby that appeared near Fullpoint in 1368 DR ; the Step-Daughter emerged from the cyst at the base of the trunk in 1373 DR .</p>
