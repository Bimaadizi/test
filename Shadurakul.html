<p>Shadurakuls were canomorphs whose original form was that of a shadow mastiff .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shadurakuls looked like "ordinary" shadow mastiffs in their hound form, and typically looked like barrel-chested, hairless humans with inky blue-black skin and cold white eyes in their humanoid form.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shadurakuls were arrogant and ruthless, disdainful of anything weak and defenseless. They rarely bothered trying to conceal their nature.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shadurakuls, like all canomorphs, possessed the ability to shift between their hound form and a humanoid form at will. Additionally, they could use greater command at will against any shadow mastiffs, and shadow mastiffs would not willingly attack them in any case.</p>
<p>Like shadow mastiffs, shadurakuls could disappear into the shadows in any conditions short of full daylight. When a shadurakul howled, all creatures except other fiends within 300 feet (91 meters) of it could potentially become panicked.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shadurakuls could fight in either form. In humanoid form, they used spiked chains; in hound form, they used their own powerful jaws.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>As the strongest yet least numerous of the canomorphs, shadurakuls often fought with the haraknins, with whom they had an intense rivalry. This rivalry also extended to the vultivors . All the canomorphs had been created by archfiends as more intelligent trackers and guard dogs, but the overlap of their potential jobs lead to competition between the three groups.</p>
<p>Like the other canomorphs, shadurakuls were native to the lower planes . They were known to speak the Common , Abyssal , and Infernal languages.</p>
