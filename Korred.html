<p>Korred , also known as the Dancing Folk , were a small race of fey with a special connection to the earth.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Korred were grey skinned humanoids with short hairy bodies and the lower-body of a goat. Their beards and hair were incredibly long and dense, snaking out in all directions. They were rarely known to wear more than a simple pair of leather britches . It was difficult to distinguish between the two korred sexes, as the women grew similarly large beards and manes of hair.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Korred were incredibly carefree, boisterous creatures that valued nature and freedom above all else. They were incredibly prideful of their hair.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The hair on the head of a korred was magical, able to be animated and commanded. It was said that their hair would transform into whatever material was used to cut it.</p>
<p>Korred possessed a mystical connection to the elemental earth that allowed them to sense the movement of the ground, smell out precious metals or gems, and navigate underground tunnels with ease. They were also innately capable of casting spells related to that elemental domain. The spells they were most frequently known to use included conjure elemental , meld into stone , stone shape , and Otto's irresistible dance .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Korred were typically known to incapacitate foes with their magical hair, weaving it into all manner of entangling ropes and snares . Some were known to simply leave such entangling hair traps lying around the perimeter of their glens, as the korred viewed actively guarding their lairs to be less worthwhile than the act of dancing and music.</p>
<p>In terms of weapons, the korred often fought with oaken cudgels and iron shears that they carried around in pouches . Though they were also seen to use their impressive strength to hurl boulders at foes. Outside of combat these shears were used by the korred to cut their hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existence of korred dated back to at least circa -34000 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , korred were one of many creatures in High Forest that united against the forces of Hellgate Keep .</p>
<p>Circa 1479 DR , members of the Cult of Voldini stole a translated copy of the legendary Tome of Twilight Boughs from the estate of the wizard Aldaron . Two korred were among the fey allies they then summoned to cover up any loose ends as they made their escape.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumors abounded that claimed the korred might have been the original creators of druid stone circles.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Korred typically lived in scattered clans within wooded hills or the feywild . They ate a primarily vegetarian diet as a courtesy to nature, though they were not opposed to hunting for game when plant-life became scarce. When hunting the korred were known to snare smaller game with their hair, catch fish in nets made from their hair, and kill bigger game with their manipulation of the elemental earth.</p>
<p>Once every week the korred would have a ceremonial celebration for their patron god Tapann the Undying in an isolated hilltop, woodland glade, or clearing. These celebrations always involved dancing and the playing of music with either bone flutes , slap-drums , or harps . To interrupt their dancing on these days was considered incredibly rude and even a cause for violence. Furthermore, these dances were more of a magic ritual than ordinary celebration, for they drained the vitality of those who engaged in the dancing and transferred it to their god Tapann. It was quite possible to die from the dancing and elderly korred considered it an honor to go out in such a manner. When the dancing finally subsided, the korred would have a feast and drink wine they had made from woodland berries in large stone vats.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Around 2,500 korred were known to live in the glades of High Forest and the lower slopes of the nearby Lost Peaks . In Cormyr some inhabited the King's Forest .</p>
<p>In West Faerun some inhabited the Forgotten Forest and the Cloak Wood .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Being so strongly tied with nature and sylvan settings the korred typically knew the languages of dryads , satyrs , centaurs , elves, sprites , and sylphs . A few were even known to speak the Druidic language . Additionally, korred possessed their own language .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Korred usually worshiped the god Tapann the Undying , though the god of satyrs Damh was considered by some to also be their patron god. Korred were also known to be servants of the gods Erevan Ilesere , Sharindlar , and Sheela Peryroyl . Those living in the Lost Peaks were known to worship Shiallia alongside Tapann.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Though they were a rather reclusive race, the korred were known to tolerate rangers , druids , and elves . Korred were also known to consort with creatures of the elemental earth, such as galeb duhr and oreads , the latter of which they were known to occasionally mate with. However, the creatures that korred were most often seen partying alongside were dryads and satyrs.</p>
<p>Korred were one of the many fey races known to serve the Seldarine . Korred in service of Sharindlar were also known to inhabit the Merciful Court , her divine realm in Nidavellir .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Many sought out the hair of korred as it could be used to manufacture ropes of entangling and nets of snaring . Though this was easier said than done, for korred took great offense at people cutting their hair. Some sought them for their distinct fermented berry wine, as it was said they could be used to brew a philter of love or a potion of human control . While others simply sought them out for their mystical connection with minerals.</p>
