<p>The Thayan Resurrection was a secret rebel organization born among the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Composed of wizards of all schools of magic except necromancy , the Thayan Resurrection's goal was the overthrow of Szass Tam and the necromancers from their rule of Thay .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Among the group were sincere revolutionaries hoping for a land more adapted to human life and power-hungry individuals who wanted to replace one ruler with another. They were structured in autonomous cells composed of just a few members in order to make it difficult for Tam's followers to destroy them with a single blow. Two noted members were Syranna and Mennek Ariz who, with help from adventurers, destroyed the most loyal liches of Tam in the secret dungeon of Doomvault .</p>
