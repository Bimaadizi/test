<p>Elminster's Hideout was a retreat designed and built by Elminster near the center of the planet Coliar . It contained a large portion of Elminster's library, as well as a vast supply of potions and four portals that led to different locations on Toril and on Earth .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The safehold was located near the central earthmote of Coliar. It slowly revolved around the territory of the red dragon Firebrand Flametongue . It emitted a constant low humming noise that could be heard from over 0.25 miles (400 meters) away.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>From the outside, the safehold appeared to be a perfectly reflective metallic sphere almost 250 feet (76 meters) in diameter. Due to its orbital motion, it reflected a faint rainbow-like pattern of light.</p>
<p>If investigated with magic such as a detect magic spell, the outer walls revealed a glowing red piece of beautiful writing that could only be read with magic such as a comprehend languages spell.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The hideout was a pocket dimension shaped like an octagonal chamber. Each of the walls alternated between holding shelves or a doorway. The chamber also contained a bed. The shelves held a vast collection of potions and scrolls that Elminster stored for himself and friends in case of need, as well as the original copies of his entire library of books and spellbooks .</p>
<p>The four doorways were invisible at their destinations and led to the following locations:</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The sphere was impenetrable to any divination or scrying spells from the outside. It could only be accessed via the Elminster's evasion spell in effect on Elminster or if someone wearing a non-magical ring bearing Elminster's name touched the outside wall without making any sound.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elminster originally built his hideout sometime in the 11 th century DR with the purpose of monitoring the activities of the Torilian dragon Firebrand Flametongue. After concluding that the dragon had the intention of retiring, Elminster repurposed the location as his hideout.</p>
