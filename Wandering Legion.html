<p>The Wandering Legion was a military organization in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the reign of the First Caliph , the Wandering Legion rose to oppose the Exalted One and his spreading of the Word of the Loregiver . They were eventually defeated but were shown mercy and had their lives spared. The vanquished legion declared: "Blessed be the Word and the Law for truly it is greater than we. None shall we follow who does not cleave to the Law." This oath was sworn upon a spear of silver that was later called the Spear of the Wandering Legion .</p>
