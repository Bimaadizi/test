<p>Leevi was one of the hunters of the Wandering Village who traveled Icewind Dale between the Ten Towns and Kuldahar on the Spine of the World in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Leevi traveled with his small community of hunters and gatherers in the harsh northern lands. Leevi had a friendly personality and welcomed business with even a drow merchant known as Nym . The hunter was respectful of Tahvo the Huntmaster, his senior and an expert on the local tundra.</p>
<p>Leevi found companionship in the arms of Carita , a local villager woman, who was married to Kyosti , one of the Wandering Village's hunters. The two lovers decided to murder Carita's husband, and she lured him away from the village, where they ended Kyosti's life.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers from Targos arrived at the village, they investigated the hunter's disappearance, discovering the truth about the murder. Carita and Leevi fled the Wandering Village. Soon after, the couple came across the Beastlord Harshom of the Host Tower of the Arcane , who was in pursuit of the adventurers. The pair eagerly informed the Beastlord of the heroes' plans and whereabouts. As a reward, both were fed to Harshom's four fierce war- bears .</p>
