<p>Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie was a human cleric of Umberlee living in the Queenspire within Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Meritid discovered a magic abalone shell floating in Waterdeep's harbor, which he thought was The Orglara , an ancient holy relic of the Bitch Queen. Taking his find as a good omen, Archneie petitioned the Lords of Waterdeep to allow him to construct a temple to Umberlee within the city, funded by half the annual tithe to Umberlee's Cache . Unlikely as this request was, the Lords agreed, but did not say why, and construction commenced.</p>
<p>By Eleasis of 1372 DR , the Queenspire was close to being finished, and Meritid called for Umberlants to join him there.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While Meritid was a faithful follower of Umberlee, he was also an agent of the Kraken Society , who operated out of the city. He was also known to be a good source of information around 1372 DR.</p>
