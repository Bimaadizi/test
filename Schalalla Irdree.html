<p>Schalalla Irdree was a bard and member of the Harpers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To confirm a story told by the bard Duthchanna of Athkatla , Schalalla and the sage Velsaert of Baldur's Gate once went on an expedition to meet the music-loving blue dragon Olothontor , the Minstrel Wyrm. They located his lair near Waterdeep and Schalalla performed for him a series of songs; Velsaert described these as "songs that repeatedly moved me to tears, despite the dangerâ€”and more than once did the same, as near as I could tell, to the dragon." Thanks to that, Olothontor let them keep their lives and leave. Schalalla promised she'd come back next season, alone and with a better harp and more songs, and Velsaert believed she did so. Volothamp Geddarm later spoke with Velsaert about the encounter.</p>
