<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore chainmail and carried a mace .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He stayed close to his subordinates in combat, fighting with mace and spell while waiting for the perfect moment to call down dark blessings to heal his allies and harm his enemies.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Renault operated out of the temple in Veil . As the Thayan commander, he held court there, and as a Banite priest, he held services there and endeavored to convert the village's inhabitants (both living and undead). His true objective was to convert these people to be loyal to him personally.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He conspired to stage a coup against the local Thayan leaders of Veil and Surcross , and he was not opposed to forming alliances with other subversive elements within these places, such as those aligned with the self-proclaimed " zulkir in exile" Dempharis Sibront .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Renault saw an opportunity to gain more converts when Veil came under attack by the Netherese enclave Kolthunral in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , which had led to dire circumstances in the village. He dreamt of amassing an army of converts whom he would lead down the Shadowfell Road to find some unsuspecting place in Faer√ªn to invade. On his way out, he further intended to collapse the Shadow Veil , the massive planar rift used by his Thayan overlords to access the Shadowfell Road.</p>
