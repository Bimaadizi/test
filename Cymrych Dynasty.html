<p>The Cymrych ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɪ m r ɪ k / KIM-rick ) dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles , and who were named for their legendary ancestor, Cymrych Hugh .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The family possessed two symbols of office: the Crown of the High King and the Sword of Cymrych Hugh .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally known as the Hugh family, the Cymrychs traced their lineage to Talfir nobility from Ebenfar who immigrated to the Moonshaes in the 2 nd century DR . Their ancestor, Callidyrr Hugh , became King of Corwell in the Year of the Troublesome Vixen, 177 DR , after quelling a six-year civil war between the Ffolk that had sparked following the end of the First Dynasty of the Moonshaes .</p>
<p>Callidyrr's son and successor was the legendary hero Cymrych Hugh, who defeated Kazgoroth in the Year of the Student, 201 DR , and was swiftly declared to be the first High King of the Ffolk. He established Caer Callidyrr , named in his father's honor, from which his descendants would rule. His first son, Warren I , would change the family name to Cymrych and become the first Cymrych monarch in the Year of the Storm Crown, 250 DR , although his rule would see a collapse of unity between the Ffolk as well as the arrival of the hostile Northmen to the Isles.</p>
<p>Beginning at this time, all of the various royal Ffolk families of the Moonshaes began to adopt the Cymrych name, generally by changing their surnames whenever a Cymrych son or daughter married into their families. Within a few generations, virtually all Ffolk dynasties were Cymrych dynasties.</p>
<p>The first of the Cymrych High Kings were not seen as strong leaders, resulting in their vassal kingdoms squabbling and disobeying them. However, in the late 3 rd century DR, High King Gwylloch and his son, Prince Ketheryll , would not only be highly successful in wars against the Northmen, but would also bring the recalcitrant Ffolk kings to heel, especially on the isle of Gwynneth .</p>
<p>The family ruled as High Kings and Queens of the Moonshaes for seven centuries before the loss of their symbols of office caused their authority to collapse. By the Year of the Animated Armor, 944 DR , while the family continued to use the title of High King, they were regarded as mere figureheads outside the realm of Callidyrr , where they continued to rule as the Carrathal Dynasty after changing their name once more.</p>
<p>At the same time that the family changed its name to "Carrathal", the many other Cymrych royal families likewise began to change the spelling and pronunciation of their names, both to avoid confusion between the families and because the long-dead Cymrych Hugh had come to be regarded as a more mythical rather than historical basis for rulership. This led to the distinct identities of the families of Cambridge , Cyric , Kendrick , Kimball , Kincaid , Riker , and Selkirk .</p>
