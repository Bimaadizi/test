<p>Marath Haldewn was the leader of a circle of Chauntean druids active on the Moonshae Isles during the middle of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marath was the last worshiper of Chauntea to watch over Earthmother's Weapons , a book containing several spells unique to her faith. She protected the book while her order passed knowledge of its spells by oral tradition.</p>
<p>During the Year of Many Bones, 1278 DR , Marath was attacked and brutally murdered by a force of Malarite berserkers who found her hidden tree-home. While she managed to dispatch half of her assailants, she was ultimately overpowered and offered as a sacrifice to the Beastlord.</p>
