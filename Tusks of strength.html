<p>Tusks of strength was a unique magical ability used by ice hunter shamans , who were specialty priests of Ulutiu , of the Great Glacier whose totem animal was Grandfather Walrus .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tusks of strength greatly enhanced the ice hunter shaman's physical strength for a brief period of time. Additionally, it caused their canine teeth to grow longer, similar to those of a walrus . The tusks did not convey the ability to attack with them in combat like a real walrus, as the human form was simply not made for that, but their presence did pay homage to Grandfather Walrus.</p>
<p>The ice hunter shaman could use this ability on themselves or convey it to another person. Tusks of strength could be called upon once per day and lasted for ten minutes.</p>
