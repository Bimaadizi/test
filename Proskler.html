<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , while posing as a strange adept of Talos , Proskler helped the relatives of Maude Kron to devise a plot against Cloak Nelvon de Jun by kidnapping his younger brother, Larch de Jun . They seized him at a great party in the Astrid Saj villa and took him to a nearby tower to enact a revenge rite. In truth, Proskler wanted to summon some hippogriffs from the Elemental Plane of Air , using the lives of all present at the rite. Eventually, an adventuring party hired by Nelvon foiled his plan and Proskler died.</p>
