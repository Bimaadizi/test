<p>Galimer "Longfingers" was a spellcaster that traveled across the Western Heartlands during the midâ€“14 th century DR with his wife Rozt'a , his foster son Tiep , and his best friend Druhallen , working as a mage -for-hire.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Galimer was a tall and strikingly handsome man, with refined features that drew the attention of those whom he met. He had curly golden locks and vibrant blue eyes. He earned his nickname from his long, willowy hands that were so well-suited for the precise movements that were required for adroit spellcasting.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Galimer was a charming, quick-witted, and even-tempered man that seldom ever raised his voice. Despite his natural way with people, he did not quite possess the mental acuity and fortitude that was required to become an expert wizard .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Galimer had a great mind for money, knowing how best to extra profit during each of his group's travels. Like his foster son Tiep , he also had impeccable sense of direction.</p>
<p>Galimer did not boast having a strong in memory for knowledge of the arcane, quick mental reflexes, nor other aptitudes valued by spellcasters. He had a tendency to panic or completely freeze in moments of high stress or danger.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Galimer kept a rather unique spellbook : a Kozakuran war fan that was inscribed with spell specifications written in silver ink.</p>
<p>During his travels, formulated a substance called second-skin lotion that helped soothe the natural wear-and-tear life on the road inflicted on a traveler's feet.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The charming mage served as the face of their company, lining up jobs and arranging contracts during each years' traveling seasons, when crossing the countryside was without undue hardship.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Galimer was born to and raised by the skilled mage named Ansoain , who herself was loosely-associated with the Zhentarim . He grew up alongside Druhallen , a young craftsman's son whom Ansoain adopted to raise as her own second apprentice after Galimer. Galimer and Dru shared a unique bond, tied to their shared arcane tutelage, that gave each man an innate sense about the well-bring of the other.</p>
<p>Some years into his adventuring career, Galimer fell head-over-heals for Rozt'a , an outspoken and captivating bodyguard who offered her services to the two young mages traveling alone in the world. After some real hardship and loss the two became married and even adopted a young orphaned boy named Tiep as their own. Galimer took on the role of reserved yet authoritative father figure to Tiep, while always looking out for his safety before all else.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galimer's life changed in the Year of the Arch, 1353 DR , when himself, Druhallen, and Ansoain took on a job escorting a bridegroom from Elversult , through the Vilhon Reach to her betrothed in Hlondeth . The caravan was ambushed by a band of Red Wizards and his mother Ansoain was killed.</p>
<p>The two brothers traveled the Heartlands together for a few years, until they met the guardswoman Rozt'a and their pair became a trio. While Galimer was immediately taken by the charm of the outspoken warrior-woman, it was Druhallen that drew Rozt'a's passionate affection. While their relationship itself lasted a few years , their brief engagement came to an end when Rozt'a revealed to Dru she was pregnant, and the mage panicked and fled from their group altogether.</p>
<p>Galimer stood by Rozt'a's side and married her in earnest. The newlywed couple remained in the city of Berdusk for the rest of Rozt'a's pregnancy, which unfortunately for them all, ended before their daughter was actually. When Druhallen returned to his friends, he was met with genuine welcome, as they would all be able to continue earning a living when Roz was fully recovered. While staying at the city's Chauntean temple , Rozt'a and Galimer encountered the young orphan Tiep, and the couple took him in as their own son.</p>
<p>The extended family of four continued their travels from one town to another, earning their living on the road. Over the course of their journeys, Galimer and Dru got their revenge on three of the Red Wizards that were present in the attack that killed their mother so many years before.</p>
<p>Determined to change the fortunes of their own lives, Dru convinced Galimer and Rozt'a to finally seek out answers to the mystery behind Ansoain's death and delve into the ruined mines of Dekanter in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR . While their plans were almost stymied by a re-routing of the Dawn Pass Trail away from the ruins, a surprisingly well-mannered goblin named Sheemzher appealed to the group to visit his mistress, the mysterious Lady Wyndyfarh in the Weathercote Wood , and listen to her proposal.</p>
<p>As the group ventured through the forest, they encountered strange and beautiful sights, along with strange creatures, both curious and eye-catching as well as fearsome and deadly. Unfortunately for them all, the young and impetuous Tiep trampled upon the natural beauty of the woods, stealing wealth from its trees and even killing some of the intelligent life that made its home within. When Galimer, Dru, Rozt'a, and Tiep were brought before Lady Wyndyfarh by Sheemzher they were met with stony cordiality, judgement, and anger.</p>
<p>When Lady Wyndyfarh accused Tiep of his transgressions, she made a menacing gesture towards the young boy and Galimer did not freeze or panic. He lunged for the otherworldly being with all his force, and Wyndyfarh incapacitated him in an instant with her magic. Wyndyfarh placed him in a sort of catatonic state within her grove, where he could thoroughly think over his life's journey up to that point, and consider his future moving forward, as she tasked his family with the means by which they could ensure his return to a conscious state of mind.</p>
<p>Galimer remained in this state for seven days, before he was finally reunited with his wife, their adoptive son, and his best friend. Galimer and Druhallen enjoyed a simple meal with they Lady of the Forest seated behind a waterfall within her grove, as she revealed to the brothers some of the secrets of Dekanter, as well as one about mysterious death of their mother.</p>
