<p>In the Year of the Howling Hourglass, 1184 DR , a thief stole Yornar's Trail Companion , holy Mielikkian spellbook from the ranger Rhighaermon O'Antlers and sold it to Lord Lathamp. In response, Rhighaermon assembled some half-dozen other followers of Mielikki and mounted a daring raid to steal it back from Lathamp's palace.
