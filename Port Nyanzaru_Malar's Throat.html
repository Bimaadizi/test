<p>Malar's Throat was a ward of the coastal city of Port Nyanzaru in Chult that lay outside the city walls. It was a slum where the city's poorest residents lived in dilapidated buildings stacked upon one another running along the walls of a ravine. It was a gritty contrast to the vibrancy of the wards that lay within the walls.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Malar's Throat served as a southern entrance to the walled areas of the city by way of a gate known as Ubtao's Jaws . The district comprised a jungle-draped ravine extending south, with rows of small, rundown buildings of old wood and stone which clung to the steep-sloped ridges, often with each structure's roof serving as the floor of the one above it. Narrow and often muddy footpaths lined the sides of the ravines, but the major walkways were the many swaying footbridges that crisscrossed the ravine—some over 100 feet (30 meters) in the air—to connect all levels of the district. These bridges were made of bamboo lashed together with rope and treated with strong smelling pitch and oil . The largest bridges were 10 feet (3 meters) wide and over 200 feet (61 meters) in length.</p>
<p>Owing to the high walls of the ravine and the jungle trees above, Malar's Throat was darker and cooler—although no less humid—than the rest of Port Nyanzaru. Even during the day, some parts of the district were lit only by speckles of light filtering through the jungle canopy. The sounds of people going about their business echoed throughout the deep ravine.</p>
<p>The floor of the ravine would flood during heavy rains, creating runoff that streamed through Ubtao's Jaws and into the Port Nyanzaru harbor (often carrying away any unattended baskets , refuse, and even the occasional person).</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Those wishing to circumvent the trade monopolies of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes could find black markets in Malar's Throat. Finding a black market buyer or seller was as simple as asking the right questions to the right people, and it usually took about a half day to track down a new blackmarketeer. However, black market dealings were harshly punished by the Ytepka Society , so any such venture was risky.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Malar's Throat was prone to attacks by jungle monsters—notably undead , pterafolk , and grungs —owing to the fact that it was outside the city walls and abutted the Chultan jungles at its furthest end. As a result, Port Nyanzaru's volunteer Citizens' Brigade helped to protect the slum's inhabitants. In case of attack, a horn was sounded to urge the inhabitants to flee to the walls or to the Temple of Tymora .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Malar's Throat was home to Port Nyzanzaru's poorest residents. It was crowded and bustling during the daytime, and while visitors could find the sensory overload of the peculiar slum to be unsettling or overwhelming, its inhabitants were more than accustomed to it. Among those who made their homes in the district were so-called " fisherlings ": thieves who would drop fishing hooks from the high bridges to expertly steal purses right off the belts of unsuspecting visitors.</p>
<p>During the colonial rule of Amn over Port Nyanzaru, Malar's Throat was among the districts where people had to live if they did not work for a major trading company.</p>
