<p>Kan-oji was a village located in Miyama Province in Kozakura .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kan-oji was a shadow of its former self, with a population of just over two hundred people and a hundred buildings, more than half of which were abandoned and in ruins. The only factor preventing the village from becoming completely desolate was the presence of the jito of the Niwa shoen .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The village was once a bustling minor port. Its primary role used to be transporting produce from nearby estates to Kuda . However, a series of unfortunate events has led to its decline. The river from the mountains deposited silt in the harbor, severely limiting its functionality. Additionally, the construction of the Great Road has redirected much of the trade that previously passed through the village. Fishing, once a staple of the village's economy, has become increasingly difficult due to extensive mud flats that emerged with each low tide.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>As of Kozakuran Year 1430 (1356 DR) , the village's jito was Kishimoto Endai . He was not particularly popular among the hyakusho</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Kishimoto Endai maintained a retinue of three samurai and ten bushi .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Recently, the village has faced a new and sinister threat. Malevolent creatures – including bakemono , evil hengeyokai , goblin rats , and oni – began stealthily descending from the mountains into Kan-oji. They used the derelict buildings as their bases, remaining inactive during the day and emerging at night to prey on unsuspecting victims. Their actions were so clandestine that there have been no direct witnesses or evidence of their presence.</p>
<p>Kishimoto Endai, along with the villagers, started to sense that something was amiss, although they lacked concrete proof. Kishimoto, unfortunately, was not an effective leader and was often preoccupied with other emergencies, leaving his samurai and bushi with little opportunity to investigate these mysterious occurrences.</p>
