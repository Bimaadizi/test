<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Matchmaker Mayhem</h3>
<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the then king of Edenvale had desired a son to succeed him but had sired only one daughter, Roxanna . Thus, when she came of age, he called for suitors for the princess, plotting to arrange a marriage. The independent Roxanna rejected this, and against her father's pleading, she proclaimed "I will not be wed in service to the crown, nor traded like some prized cattle. Any man that shall marry me must first defeat me in battle." Thereafter, she fought a series of duels against would-be suitors, and was victorious each time. When one suitor, a vassal of the kingdom Bryan the Bold , introduced bloodforge battles, these contests escalated into the conflict known as Matchmaker Mayhem .</p>
<h3>During the Legendary Campaign</h3>
<p>Afterward, Edenvale Castle was ruled over by Timmis Taern , who was prideful but lacking in tactical ability. The leader of the Legendary Campaign , who sought to unify and pacify the Utter East through conquest, lured Timmis beyond the castle walls through trickery before striking in a bloodforge battle.</p>
<p>When a ruler of Edenvale passed away without an heir, the Legendary Campaign leader marched on Edenvale Castle to claim the throne. Madja Djiid contested this, and the two fought a bloodforge battle outside Edenvale Castle.</p>
<p>Following this, the Legendary Campaign leader was caught in a dragged-out conflict with Deliah Deguerre 's forces. The two armies raced to Edenvale Castle for reinforcement, but ended their rivalry before its walls.</p>
<h3>Modern History</h3>
<p>In the late 1360s DR , Edenvale was ruled by Queen Rosalind .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Atreus Eleint of Erlkazar in west Faerûn undertook an expedition to the Utter East to find the fabled realm of Langdarma , passing through Edenvale, where they were joined by Rishi Saubhari . They were never seen again, so Queen Rosalind sent Atreus's personal effects to King Korox of Erlkazar.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Edenvale was ruled by a succession of monarchs.</p>
<h2>Notable locations</h2>
<p>A key fortification of Edenvale was Edenvale Castle , which serve as the palace and home of the kings and queens of Edenvale in the 7th century DR. It lay in the Sempadan Forest, between Herne's Wood and the Web Mountains.</p>
