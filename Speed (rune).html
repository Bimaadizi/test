<p>Speed was a type of giant rune.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>When a creature wore footwear inscribed with this rune, they were capable of moving at far greater speeds. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, then this effect would be even greater.</p>
<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing . The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to forty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a set of any kind footwear. Even horseshoes were known to work for this purpose.</p>
