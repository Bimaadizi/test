<p>Hadrhune was an ambitious human shade who served as the right hand of High Prince Telamont Tanthul , ruler of Thultanthar , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hadrhune fought his way up through the ranks of his peers, proving himself to be a capable manipulator as well as a determined and talented mage . With his skills (and the elimination of his rivals), he soon became Telamont's top agent and personal emissary. Using divination spells, he became probably the most knowledgeable shade in the entire city on matters of the world outside of Anauroch , taking particular interest in the realm of Thay and the dungeon of Undermountain . Using resources diverted from the city, his agents scoured the ruins he took interest in, looking for lost Netherese magic . It was also he who suggested the destruction of any settlements near the enclave, seeing that modern-day adventurers could pose a serious threat to his peoples' plans of world domination.</p>
<p>On Nightal 5 of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Hadrhune together with Most High Telamont summoned Mephistopheles in order to gain more information about Kesson Rel , who threatened the shadovar 's ongoing conquest of Sembia .</p>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Hadrhune plotted with the leader of a hive of hated phaerimm to obtain a set of the Nether Scrolls . In exchange for their aid, he taught them the secrets of the Shadow Weave . The Scrolls were in the form of a tree, the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar , and required a complex ritual to return them to their proper form. However, a group of heroes were following the trail of the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar and had procured a way to destroy it before the Scrolls could be obtained. In doing so, Hadrhune flew to the site of the ritual atop his shadow dragon Delethyrsos to take his revenge, but didn't realize that the tree negated the dead-magic zone in the Weave . Hadrhune battled the heroes, but survived, most likely using his power to shadow walk to escape when the fight went against him.</p>
<p>Hadrhune was still alive and well at the onset of the Second Sundering in the 1480s DR. However, he was dead by 1487 DR , with his resurrection prohibited by his master Telamont.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Evil through and through, Hadrhune was cold and calculating. He often used scrying to realize his goals and had no qualms about spying on his allies, using bribes and personally crafting magic items . He was ambitious as well, planning on obtaining for himself a position of governor of Thay or the North and then using the magic of the Red Wizards or Halaster to cement his power in the hierarchy.</p>
<p>Although he was still young for a shade, he fully intended to pursue lichdom when his body began to fail him.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>Hadrhune's personal sigil was a silver winged serpent coiling around a gray tower all on a black field.</p>
