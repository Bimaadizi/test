<p>Charlice Churlgo was one of many children of Millie Churlgo who produced the infamous Churlgo Cheese in the Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Charlice Churlgo was a hardworking and diligent worker who often nibbled on the cheese she produced.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Charlice worked from the inside of the farmhouse where she along with other family members kept an eye on the cheese-filled vats and taste-tested the product, making sure it was up to the Churlgo quality standards.</p>
<p>Charlice, along with other Churlgos moved their farm from the Dalelands to Daggerford following a nasty extortion business with the Iron Throne . In 1372 DR, the farm where they resided was still noticeably un-lived-in, but the cheese-making business was in full swing.</p>
