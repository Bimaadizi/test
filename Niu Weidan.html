<p>Niu Weidan was a thief of antiquity from the nation of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur who lived many generations before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Countless years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Niu Weidan made a name for himself as a notorious thief who wielded a powerful and deadly weapon â€“ The Jade Fang . He used the dagger 's magics to paralyze his opponents and then draining their life force to restore his own fleeting vitality. In the end, Niu Weidan's life was taken by the old age and not by an angry blade. Niu Weidan's descendants kept the The Jade Fang as a family heirloom for many generations, never using it in combat.</p>
