With no battles to protect the nobleman in, Lord's Command became Francis' ceremonial garb and served him in this fashion until his death of old age. The lord's daughter inherited this piece of armor but eventually solid it to pay for a new library building for her subjects.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , Lord's Command was in stock at the shop of Derval Ironeater in Daggerford .</p>
