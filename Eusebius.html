<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1369 DR , the then- paramount of the storm giants of Mount Woe, Anastes , and five other storm giants were summoned magically by Lanaxis to defend him when he needed to rest during his kidnapping of Queen Brianna and her son Kaedlaw . Eusebius was one of those giants. Eusebius was chosen to search the woods for a beehive to gather honey for Brianna to eat, but during this time, Tavis Burdun and armies of giant-kin attacked. Eusebius was then ordered by Anastes to deal with the fomorians . However, the fomorians quickly abandoned the field to pursue Lanaxis, so Eusebius instead assisted Anastes by flanking the firbolg army. Eusebius killed many firbolgs with his lightning and his massive sword, but he was eventually felled by fire magic from the firbolg shaman Munairoe and an arrow from Tavis that had been enchanted by the verbeeg Basil . Eusebius managed to kill Munairoe before he finally died.</p>
