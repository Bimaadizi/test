<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jelde was born as Semoor Wolftooth in Espar village. He went to search of fortune with Florin Falconhand , Doust Sulwood , and Islif Lurelake . During their adventures, he found his vocation as a cleric of Lathander and in order to follow the god's dogma, he renamed himself "Jelde Asturien."</p>
<p>At some point before 1369 DR , after forming the Knights of Myth Drannor, Jelde found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of House Ammath in Glim-Gardens and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. The vault contained Jelde's blade of destruction and a set of arcane mail .</p>
<p>Later, he served as seneschal of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in Shadowdale and fought against drow , Zhentarim , and Lashan Aumersair . After this last adventure, Jelde retired to Eveningstar to serve his god.</p>
