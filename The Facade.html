<p>The Facade was an artifact created during the ancient Imaskar Empire . One of the Faces of Madness , it was once thought to be one of the Imaskarcana .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An alliance of Imaskari archwizards known as the Cabal of Madness created a number of masks known as the Faces of Madness , each themed around a school of magic , over a period decades after striking a bargain with horrors from beyond their world. The Facade was one of these masks. Each of these major artifacts were created with a curse that only the creator knew how to avoid. Before they were able to implement their plans, however, the Mulan rebelled with the aid of their gods , ultimately destroying Imaskar as a nation. In the resulting tumult, the masks were scattered.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The Facade was a bizarre face wrapping made of chains , hiding all but the wearer's eyes.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Dedicated to the school of enchantment , The Facade granted a continuous, overwhelming resistance to enchantment spells, and empowered the caster's own enchantments to defeat innate resistances against all spells. It also cast a powerful charm on anyone within 15 feet (4.6 meters) of the wearer, making them react more favorably if their willpower wasn't sufficient to overcome it. Finally, they got the ability to cast, five times a day, their choice of suggestion , emotion , Tasha's hideous laughter , mass charm , dominate monster , and sleep .</p>
<p>However, every time the mask was put on, the wearer was assaulted with feelings of paranoia and worthlessness. This could permanently drain their force of personality, if their willpower wasn't enough to overcome this curse; a remove curse or break enchantment used in a timely manner could prevent permanent damage.</p>
