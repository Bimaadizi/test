<p>Danivarr's House was a high-class inn in Everlund in the midâ€“14 th and late-15 th century DR and was one of the oldest inns in the city.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Formerly a mansion, Danivarr's was one of the largest inns in all of Everlund. It was connected to an adjacent mansion by several rickety, covered, flying bridges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to becoming an inn, Danivarr's House was some noble's mansion.</p>
<p>Some time after War of the Silver Marches in the late 15 th century DR , the inn was bought by the Zoar family, but they left a one-eyed half-orc named Dral Thelev to run the business.</p>
<p>Around this same time, both the Zhentarim and Harpers were known to be keeping a close eye on the establishment.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The clientele of the inn was typically known to include royalty, adventurers, and people who were convinced that they were nobility whether it be due to delusions of grandeur or archaic titles.</p>
