<p>Flame flowers were a rare plant native to the Elemental Plane of Fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These flowers were composed entirely of fire, and appeared and glowed much like individual flames.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Flame flowers propagated their seeds by exploding in a burst of fire. Touching a flame flower with anything other than fire could trigger this blast, which could be dangerous for creatures within a 7.5‑foot-radius (2.3‑meter).</p>
<p>They grew best in cooled lava.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A garden known as the Hall of Flame Flowers was carefully cultivated in the catacombs beneath the Flaming Brazier —the grand temple to Kossuth within the city of Bezantur , Thay —as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . Located in a large chamber beneath the temple's Inner Sanctum, the meandering paths and thousands of flame flowers offered a serene place for meditation.</p>
<p>Flame flower motifs were sometimes used to decorate wizard robes . Chevesh of Airspur wore such decoration as of the late 15 th century DR.</p>
