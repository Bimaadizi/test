<p>Mount Dread was an underground complex near Shadowdale . By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , it was a monster lair once used by the evil mage Azazabus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dungeon was near Shadowdale. There were at least two levels in it, and the second level might well have had stairs to a lower level still.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Presumably, Mount Dread must've been in a mountainous region.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Of note, the most immediately accessible level contained a small underground tower-like structure, where a wall once held a ladder to a higher level; that level had since collapsed, leaving the ladder a path to nowhere. One room in the same level was an old prison, and a few rooms had worked stone floors rather than bare rock or dirt. Those rooms included a smithy, a trapped side room with a golden statue and a room used by orcs .</p>
<p>The lower level's layout wasn't known, but it included an old library, a paper-walled room made by giant wasps , and a mine shaft.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Part of the lower level connected to an old mineshaft, strongly implying the location was originally a mine.</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Mount Dread was the lair of numerous monsters that attacked locals near Shadowdale , making local authorities call for adventurers; the same heroes who braved the Tomb of Damara and Harrow Hill might've been among them. Before that, Mount Dread had been the center of activities once for the evil mage Azazabus .</p>
<p>As they progressed into the dungeon, they might've encountered a gnome, Tinker , who needed a special silver spring for a certain, secret project. They may also have come across a number of gnomes who were looking for a special glowing moss there, which they required for a catapult meant for their king. Another mage, Kordak , could've come across them. He'd have tried to charm them or otherwise make them kill a brown bear that had taken up residence nearby, before trying to kill them.</p>
<p>Should they have pushed into the lower level, they may have chanced upon a lammasu also took temporary shelter there to examine an old library, and a duergar called Axerock , whose treasure was stolen by drow .</p>
