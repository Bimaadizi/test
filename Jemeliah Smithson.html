<h2>History</h2>
<p>He spent half of his long life working for Gallaway Trading Coaster. In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Karrl Rider and Jemeliah accompanied Rawleigh Gallaway 's caravan to the town of Lonelywood . The business venture was cut short by a barbarian army that besieged the town, stopping the Gallaway Trading Coaster wagons from leaving. Karrl, Jemeliah, and Rawleigh Gallaway all were stuck until the barbarian threat was over. Years later, when Rawleigh Gallaway, Deirdre Gallaway's father, approached Jemeliah asking for "one last favor" â€“ to lend Deirdre his expertise and sharp mind in Targos. By the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Jemeliah had been living in Targos for ten years, working for the Gallaway Trade Depot on top of the cliff overlooking the docks of Targos. He remained in Deirdre Gallaway's employ through the Legion of the Chimera crisis of 1312 DR. Jemeliah did not hold back criticizing the Targos Guard for confiscating Gallaway Trade Depot's goods and lumber for the town's fortification. The guard racked up a huge debt with the coaster to Jemeliah's disapproval.</p>
