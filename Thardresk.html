<p>Thardresk was the royal house of Anauria , one of the three Lost Kingdoms that emerged from ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>It was one of Anauria's three great human houses, situated above the noble houses of Maluradek and Nemrin .</p>
<p>Both King Thausimbel the Wise , and his daughter Queen Shaddara the Fair were members of House Thardresk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of House Thardresk, Anauria was able to forge lasting peaceful relations with nearby elven communities, the dwarves of Oghrann , and even those men that dwelled around the Dragonreach .</p>
<p>A number of Anauria tombs were built across the kingdom throughout its existence in northern Faerûn. Having been linked to House Thardresk over time, rumors formed that some of these crypts held the ruins of King Thausimbel the Wise, most notably the tomb in the Serpent Hills and a temple of Jergal in the capital city of Amazandar . Both of these sets of catacombs were false leads, actually housing a network of portals that linked to the perilous Dungeon of Swords .</p>
<p>Like the other great houses of Anauria, signs of the Thardresk family could still be found across the ruins of Anauria in the Anauroch desert circa the Era of Upheaval , centuries after the kingdom's fall.</p>
