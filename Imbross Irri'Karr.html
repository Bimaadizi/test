<p>Imbross Irri'Karr was a member of Neverwinter's Rangers that helped watch over the Rothé Valley region north of the city in the late 15 th century DR .He was considered one of the high-ranking rangers among his group, second-in-command to Dassar Truebow .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Something of a rarity, Imbross was betrothed to a non-drow elf named Ayriisha , who was in fact a paladin of Corellon .</p>
<p>He had as strained relationship with some members of his family, namely his grandmother, likely due to the assassins she directed to slay Imbross and his parents. According to Imbross' father, he hoped that "her treacherous brain (would be) sucked out by a mind flayer ."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Imbross and his family once lived within a drow city but fled to the surface city of Neverwinter when Imbross' mother could not follow through with the sacrificial killing of his father.</p>
<p>Imbross worked with Dassar and the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge from Neverwinter to deal with drow slavers that were abducting folks in Rothé Valley. Due to his own drow heritage, Imbross was able to convince some within the drow camp that he was a spy directed to infiltrate the rangers and gain access to their hidden camp.</p>
<p>After dealing with a band of drow assassins that were operating in the valley, Imbross helped the Neverwinter hero sneak into the drow slavers' camp, arm the captured slaves with stolen weapons, and lead an uprising so they could earn their freedom. During the raid they managed to recover some ledgers that helped them glean information about the location of a nearby drow outpost in the Underdark .</p>
<p>He remained active years later and reunited with his fellow comrade-in-arms again when the Cult of the Dragon became active in Rothé Valley. Imbross helped smuggle the hero into their camp, to help defeat the local cult cell leader Dragonsoul Ohmertz .</p>
