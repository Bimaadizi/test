<p>Crispyleaf was a bush-like small tree with edible leaves that grew in the polar regions of Anadia .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crispyleaf grew to short heights. Each bush displayed several hundred small, thorn-like, edible leaves.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The edible crispyleaf leaves had the ability to temporarily satisfy any appetite, no matter how fierce, for about one hour per leaf eaten. If more than ten leaves were consumed within an hour, their compound effect became poisonous and risked gastric failure.</p>
<p>Despite their filling properties, the leaves were not sufficiently nourishing. A diet consisting only of crispyleaf could lead to lethal malnutrition within a week. For this reason, if consumed moderately, crispyleaf could be used as naturally occurring weight-loss food. The leaves could also be used as a gastric pain-reliever.</p>
<p>In all applications, the leaves could be consumed freshly picked or dried, although they lost near half of their potency if dried.</p>
