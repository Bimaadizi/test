<p>Sparkrender was a blue dragon wyrmling active in the late 15 th century DR . He was remarkably loathsome and dangerous for his age, and plotted to use the lingering spirits of dead dragons on Stormwreck Isle to grant himself godlike power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was skinny for a blue wyrmling, and his scales glittered.</p>
<p>His roar sounded more like a screech, and when he spoke it sounded akin to barking and growling.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was arrogant, vain, and boastful. While he could be scheming and manipulative, he was also aggressive, quick to resort to violence and to lobbing curses at his enemies. He was a tyrannical leader over his minions.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sparkrender had just begun to amass a hoard in the late 15 th century DR, and many of his treasures were either mundane items that had caught his eye—notably he seemed fond of candlesticks —or gemstones that were blue in color, such as blue quartz and blue jasper .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Eldenemir , a great blue dragon known as the "Raging Storm", had been Sparkrender's grandfather and was the inspiration in his quest for power. He hated the bronze dragon Runara , who had slain Eldenemir decades before Sparkrender's birth. While Runara still dwelt on Stormwreck Isle at the time of Sparkrender's plot, she had sworn off violence since killing Eldenemir, and so did little to disrupt the evil wyrmling's plans.</p>
<p>Sparkrender had a following of kobolds on Stormwreck Isle, recruiting the ones who disagreed with the more peaceful way of life enjoyed by their kin at Dragon's Rest . While some of his minions were tasked with roving the island and attacking travelers, his most loyal followers joined him at his lair in the Clifftop Observatory . These included the kobolds Ekrash , Erp , and Hev , as well as the winged kobolds Mek , Minn , Nuhro , and Snirke .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , Sparkrender had taken up residence in the Clifftop Observatory on Stormwreck Isle, the same site where his grandfather had attempted to harness the power of the island's fallen dragons a century prior. While he kept a modest hoard in the Observatory's tower, Sparkrender's reason for being there was not as a lair, but to enact his "big plans" to bind the spirits of fallen dragons and claim their power, transforming himself into an avatar of draconic might. Using the old and creaking orrery at the Observatory, he plotted to hold his ritual at a time when he believed the King-Killer Star would be closest to Toril , believing that this comet held power over the destiny of dragons.</p>
<p>The appointed time for the ritual was quite close by the time Sparkrender met his first major resistance—in the form of an attack by a bronze dragon wyrmling named Aidron —and by that time he had already been on the island for nearly a year, during which time he had amassed a following of more than a dozen kobold minions. Believing that he needed Aidron as a sacrifice to complete his ritual, he subdued the bronze wyrmling after failing to trick him into joining him. His kobold minions then set about completing the preparations for the ritual by building and painting crude sculptures of the five great dragons whom Sparkrender intended to bind: the great red dragon Sharruth , the three metallic dragons who defeated Sharruth long ago— Astalagan , Clyssavar , and Turadaer —and his own grandfather, Eldenemir.</p>
