<p>Tumbledown was a district located within the Outer City region of Baldur's Gate . It was located outside the south-eastern region of the Lower City , just beyond the Cliffgate . It was a dreary, foggy neighborhood that was believed to have been haunted.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While Tumbledown was well-protected by winds thanks to the massive hill to the east, it was often nearly completely covered in mist and fog that rose up from the River Chionthar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 15 th century DR , the land that would encompass Tumbledown held a grand estate that belonged to the mercantile Szarr family. Unfortunately, every member of the Szarrs was murdered by a rival house, and their holdings were burnt to the ground.</p>
<p>Ghosts of the family were said to haunt Tumbledown for years following their death.</p>
