<p>The Khaundrove family was one of the twenty wealthy families that made up the Onsruur (the hereditary council of lords) in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>This family tended toward short, stocky bodies with lots of muscle but no distinguishing facial features. They studied war and battle strategy as a hobby, setting up large gaming tables decorated to look like various plots of actual locations around Faerûn in miniature.</p>
<p>They were ultraconservative, believing that humans and not dwarves should hold all the power and wealth in Khôltar ( gnomes and halflings were dismissed as insignificant). They were staunchly adamant that the Onsruur should not allow any new members to have a seat at the table.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Khaundroves inserted themselves into the business and political arenas of Tashalar , and (with an inflated view of their own importance) thought they were a rising power in that country.</p>
<p>In addition to their many manufacturing properties, the Khaundroves owned the hole-in-the-wall blurdren (food counter) known as Mother Talasko's .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>This family owned foundries and stamping factories that produced cheap knock-offs of many high-quality goods exported by the dwarves of the Great Rift . They used the lowest priced raw materials and flooded the markets in the Vilhon Reach and Calimshan .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The klathlaaedin (fancy sculpted stone mansion) of the Khaundroves was a fairly tasteful edifice named Baharrokhbrur located on the North Way very close to Farrgaunlar (the southern gate into Khôltar).</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>They were rancorous rivals of the Horthander clan, whom they nicknamed the "Horsefaces".</p>
