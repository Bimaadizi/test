<p>A hornblade was a magic weapon that produced a bladed weapon from a small piece of horn.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Even on close inspection, nine times out of a ten, a hornblade appeared to just be a simple piece of animal horn, 6​ to ​15 inches (15​ to ​38 centimeters) long, set into a handle or grip. But when a particular spot was pressed just so, the horn would extend into a curved sickle -shaped blade that was quite sturdy and sharp. They varied in size, from knives and daggers to scimitars .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As magical weapons, hornblades of knife and dagger size were typically +1 or +2 , while those of scimitar size were often +2 or +3 in strength. They could be wielded the same way and with the same training as their conventional counterparts. Smaller hornblades could also be thrown just like regular knives and daggers could be. The blade could be retracted after use.</p>
<p>If examined with detect magic or the like, an unactivated hornblade revealed an aura of faint enchantment magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A 9‑inch-long (23‑centimeter) dagger-sized +2 hornblade was in the possession of the duergar soldiers of Deepearth in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR .</p>
