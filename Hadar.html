<p>Hadar , also known as the Dark Hunger , was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Hadar didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hadar was a cinder-red star, barely visible in the night sky.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hadar and the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace were somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Hadar was a dying star, slowly burning into annihilation. Because of that it sent its agents, the Heralds of Hadar , to Toril to feed on living creatures in a desperate attempt to avert its demise.</p>
<p>Hadar was usually sought out by some warlocks to make a pact with it. Neogi were specially adept to seek out pacts with it and the other Far Realm-infested stars. To those few Hadar bestowed the ability to use the spells arms of Hadar , hunger of Hadar , as well as brood of Hadar .</p>
