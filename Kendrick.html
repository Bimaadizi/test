<p>The Kendrick family were Ffolk nobles from Caer Corwell who served as Kings of Corwell and later High Kings and Queens of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like all royal families of the Moonshaes, the Kendricks traced their lineage to the Cymrych family of High Kings and Queens, and potentially to its founder, Cymrych Hugh . However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR , most families began to distance themselves from the name "Cymrych" and instead embraced alternative pronunciations and spellings of their names. This is how the kings and queens of Corwell on Gwynneth Isle came to be known as the "Kendrick" family. The family's use of a bear as their sigil predated this name change and was already in use by the Kendrick's ancestors as of the 3 rd century DR, when it was used by King Durnhal and Queen Morgan of Corwell.</p>
<p>The family long ruled as kings and queens of Corwell from their ancestral seat at Caer Corwell . The family then rose to become the High Kings and Queens of the Moonshae Isles when Tristan Kendrick united the Ffolk and their ancient enemies, the Northlanders in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR , with the signing of the Treaty of Oman . The family moved their seat to Caer Callidyrr on Alaron , and their rule was further cemented in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , under Tristan's successor, High Queen Alicia , who established the United Moonshae Isles . Alicia successfully brought both the Ffolk and the Northlander kingdoms of the Moonshaes under the Kendrick banner, and worked to integrate the two cultures and to end the islands' longstanding isolationism. She and her consort, High King Keane , worked to entrench the Kendricks as a dynasty by raising worthy heirs for their kingdom.</p>
<p>Their reign was challenged with the emergence of the fey realm of Sarifal on Gwynneth in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , who began to encroach on the Kendricks' ancestral seat in Corwell. The power of the Kendrick dynasty further suffered following the invasion of the island of Snowdown by Amnian forces in the Year of the Sceptered One, 1404 DR ; the death (and presumed assassination) of High Queen Alicia in the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR ; an insurgency led by a rival claimant to the throne, Lionel Carrathal ; and Amnian mercenaries laying siege to Corwell, creating opportunity for the fey of Sarifal to expel the remaining humans from Gwynneth in the Year of the Dauntless Dwarves, 1412 DR . In the following decades, events conspired to strip House Kendrick of many of their lands. At the same time, internal squabbles amongst the many Kendrick cousins led to scheming and killing.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , High King Derid Kendrick aspired to reclaim his family's former glory regardless of the risks of armed conflict with his neighbors.</p>
