<p>Curst was a gate-town leading to Carceri from the Outlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Curst was a walled city shaped almost like a circle, with the Gateway to Carceri situated at its heart. From this central gate, four primary roads extended outward, culminating at exit points in the city walls. The interior of Curst was divided into distinct districts by five concentric roads. These roads radiated outwards from the town's center, with each successive ring being broader than the previous one.</p>
<p>The center of Curst, called the Gate Square, also contained the town's government offices, jail, and treasury. The wealthy and powerful of Curst built their homes past the first ring road. The second ring road was home to the merchants and their warehouses. Craftsmen and their workshops were found on the third ring road. The fourth ring road was filled with inns, taverns, and stables. Beyond the final ring road was the city wall, the inside of which was covered in razorvine .</p>
<h3>Gates</h3>
<p>The Gate to Carceri was constructed of black razorvine. It was an arch with four pillars, with portals located within the center of each arch. The Gate led directly to Othrys , the first layer of Carceri, and so it saw little use.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The residents of this gate-town, mostly human , githzerai , and creatures from the Lower Planes, were primarily exiles or refugees from elsewhere. Much of their time was spent plotting revenge against those who wronged them and attempting to form militias to enact their revenge, but only after conquering Curst itself, of course. This often resulted in large-scale conflicts within the gate-town.</p>
<p>The gate-town's wall was patrolled by the Wall Watch. Their primary goal was to make it as difficult as possible for an individual to leave Curst.</p>
