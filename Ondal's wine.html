<p>Ondal's wines were white or golden wines made by the mage and vintner Ondal prior to the spellplague of 1385 DR , when Ondal's manor and most of his wine cellar was destroyed. A few wagonloads of wine escaped destruction and these were soon recovered and dispersed throughout the Realms .</p>
<p>The wine was noteworthy in that the Spellplague infused wild magic into the bottles and, whenever a bottle was opened, uncontrolled destructive magic was released. Numerous groups attempted to find the remaining bottles and either destroy them or use them for nefarious purposes.</p>
