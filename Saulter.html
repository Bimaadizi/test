<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time the Wailing Death ravaged Neverwinter in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Saulter's home district, Peninsula, was not only hit by the plague, but also by a riot in the district's prison, spilling its inmates out into the streets. Saulter managed to evacuate from the district alongside his wife Maureen , before it was quarantined off by the Neverwintran militia but not before he lost his family to the plague. Now homeless, Saulter had to sleep on city streets by a beggars' campfire in the City Core , where he mourned the loss of his old home and the fact that he couldn't mourn the dead in the comfort of his own home.</p>
