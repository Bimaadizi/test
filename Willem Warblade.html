<p>Willem Warblade was a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Willem forced a group of dwarf smiths out of their workshop in the Hall of Wonder and moved in in their place. Thereafter, the dwarves hid in the foothills, angrily cursing the intruder. The Legendary Campaign leader discovered them there, then returned to the Hall of Wonder to evict Willem in a bloodforge battle.</p>
