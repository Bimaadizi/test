<p>Resurrection Spring was a spring in Northknife Pass across the Dustwall Mountains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A small spring lay close to the highest point in the pass, surrounded by a flowerbed: it had tiny purple and white flowers, with occassional large crimson blossoms and pure white lillies. The water was so cold it numbed the mouth, and animals would not willingly drink it. It was also the last source of water in the pass, and thus known as Resurrection Spring.</p>
