<p>The church of Tchazzar was the collective worshipers of Tchazzar , the red dragon hero-king that founded Chessenta during the 10 th century DR . During the Era of Upheaval , it was considered among one of the most popular faiths in all of Chessenta.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Tchazzar's holy symbol was the profile of a red dragon, set over a black mountain.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Missionaries of the faith traveled far and wide across Chessenta, extolling the dragon king's virtues and sharings tales of his great victories.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Tchazzar's church was centered in the Chessentan city of Cimbar . Smaller congregations also formed in the cities of Airspur and Akanax .</p>
<h2>Equipment, Spells, and Relics</h2>
<p>Initiates of Tchazzar's faith were granted access to certain spells, including flare , flame blade , Palarandusk's fire breath , fireball , magic vestment , and fire shield .</p>
<p>The most favored of Tchazzar's faithful were given pendants each called the eye of Tchazzar .</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>The Blades of Tchazzar was the military branch of Tchazzar's church. They were commanded by directly by the Father of Chessenta on missions critical to his faith.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Allies</h3>
<p>Despite Tchazzar's personal service to Tiamat the Dragon Queen, his church remained almost entirely neutral to the church of Tiamat . While the members of each faith shared similar goals, they seldom if ever worked in partnership with the others.</p>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>The church garnered many foes among the rulers of Chessentan cities during the late 14 th century, most notably in Airspur, Luthcheq , and Soorenar (before its downfall). The church was also considered among the foes of both righteous powers, such as the Triadic crusaders of Impiltur , and more malevolent groups, like the original Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<p>Due to Tchazzar's centuries-long feud with Alasklerbanbastos , minions of the Great Bone Wyrm were considered hostile enemies. There existed however a tenuous d√©tente between the church and the Great Bone Wyrm's forces in Threskel and Unther , as those cities were allied with the Untheric branch of Tiamat's church .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While the roots of Tchazzar's church originated some time during or around his rise to power, it became entrenched in Chessentan lore following the dragon king's disappearance in the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR . It was among the many hero-cults that became prominent throughout the realm at the time. Tchazzar's priests claimed that he would soon return to Chessenta and lead the realm into newfound glory.</p>
<h3>Era of Upheaval</h3>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Tchazzar received one third of Tiamat 's divine essence, becoming part of Tiamat's Trinity. In short time, Tchazzar consumed the other two members of the trinity, fulfilling the conditions to ascend as the aspect of Tiamat , one that assumed her physical form in the Realms. The church became emboldened at that time, and appeared who wholly take over the pre-existing hero cult.</p>
<p>Just over a decade later, in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the church was renewed in strength once again, when Tchazzar appeared in the Realms in his true form as a demipower . Within six years , Tchazzar secured his control over much of Chessenta, but this would only last a scant few years. After the Spellplague struck the Realms in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Cimbar was destroyed and Tchazzar himself went missing.</p>
<p>A new incarnation of Tchazzar reappeared in the Realms during the Era of Upheaval , claiming the city of Erebos as its own.</p>
