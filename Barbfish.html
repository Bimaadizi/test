<p>A barbfish was a species of edible mud sharks that inhabited lower reaches of the River Specie in Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The species' name was inspired by the fleshy barbs that grew on the sides of the fishes' mouths. Their skin was mud-colored, tough, and covered in a constantly secreting foul rot-smelling slime. These creatures could grow to be as large a horse .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Barbfish used their fleshy namesake spurs to feel through riverbed mud and into otherwise inaccessible clefts while scavenging for food. They were a lethargic and lazy species that spent most of their lives slowly gliding along the river bottom and feeding.</p>
<p>Despite living in river muck, these fish were known for their great taste. Barbfish flesh was eaten raw, fried, or poached in milk and butter . The skin was extremely unappealing and was always discarded. According to Volothamp Geddarm , barbfish was especially delectable when boiled with currants and berries .</p>
