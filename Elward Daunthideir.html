<p>Elward Daunthideir , or Elward Varsoond Emmellero Daunthideir , was the steward of Lady Joysil Ambrur in Marsember in Cormyr during the late 14 th century DR . He may have also been a slaver and smuggler.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The parsimonious, brusque man behaved with dignity and disdain.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Elward Daunthideir was the steward of Lady Joysil Ambrur . Roldro Tattershar strongly implied he also engaged in other, less savory activities involving smuggling and slavery while working under Ooaurtann of Westgate as a trade-agent.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Elward was summoned to the door of Haelithtorntowers , the Marsemban residence of Lady Joysil Ambrur, by the door guard, Melarvyn , as the bard Roldro Tattershar was at the door demanding to be let in and threatening to call the watch. Once Elward was in sight, Roldro threatened to call the watch on him and reveal to them the fate of Iliskar Northwind , the fate of a crab meat shipment the month earlier, and the steward's role in the dispute between the Seven Traders and port tax collectors two months prior to that. He also mentioned he'd speak of the Marsemban trade-agent known as Varsoond, working for Ooaurtann of Westgate. Elward became very pale, and agreed to let Roldro in to see Lady Ambrur.</p>
<p>Once they arrived at her room, Elward was ordered to feed the rainbow-fins in the south pond, effectively asking him not to eavesdrop.</p>
