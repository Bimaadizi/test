<h2>Base of Operations</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the Gilded Gallows was prospering and its influence was extending along the Sword Coast, with operatives as far north as Neverwinter . Its symbol—a gold noose—had become instantly recognizable among criminals in the region.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , rumors had surfaced that a high-ranking member had betrayed the guild to steal a large sum of money , and so members of the guild were motivated to track down this traitor and the wealth he had secreted away. In fact, the traitor was Tarak , who had been ordered to kill his own lover and had instead chosen to flee the guild. His lover was ultimately assassinated by another member of the guild, and the story was twisted to accuse Tarak of murder and theft.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Guildmembers were known as "Gilders", and included not only thieves but assassins , poisoners , gamblers, smugglers, and goblins . They recruited even very young children into their ranks, and trained them in stealth and deception. Some high-ranking members had tattoos featuring the guild's golden noose symbol.</p>
