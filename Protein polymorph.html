<p>Protein polymorphs were a rare, amorphous form of life that were each made up of a colony of cellular organisms.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These creatures were capable of assuming the form of almost any animate creature and inanimate object. A protein polymorph could even transform itself into several forms, such as a dozen kobolds , which were all connected via a near-invisible cord of protoplasm. However, they could not accurately copy facial expressions or replicate the sound of speech. Their forms would possess the equivalent strength of the creature or item they imitated, but would not possess their unique abilities.</p>
