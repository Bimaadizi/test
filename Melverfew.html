<p>Melverfew was a cheap stewed dish favored by the lower class Waterdhavians as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Melverfew was made using diced eels , flounder , and harbor catfish , simmered until soft with big fleshy mushrooms in an oxen -and- onion gravy . The meat then was strained out, deboned, and returned into the stew with added shredded stale bread . Lastly, a handful of grapes or gooseberries as well as raisins were added in and cooked further.</p>
<p>Melverfew was a cheap staple, enjoyed by many, but celebrated by few. It was priced at a single copper piece per a large bowlful. That copper also bought a mug of small beer that came together with the stew.</p>
