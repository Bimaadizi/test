<p>The Great White Bear was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters .</p>
<p>It was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped him to eat polar bear meat or fat, wear anything made from polar bear, or otherwise harm a polar bear. However, those shamans that worshiped him could call upon polar fury once each day, summon polar bears to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a polar bear twice each tenday.</p>
<p>Additionally, iceguardians who revered the Great White Bear alongside Ulutiu also could call upon polar fury once each day.</p>
