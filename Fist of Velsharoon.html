<p>The Fist of Velsharoon was a macabre enchanted mace that was sacred to the Church of Velsharoon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mace was crafted to resemble an emaciated arm grabbing a ribbed sphere.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When wielded by an individual whose heart wasn't evil , the mace behaved as an ordinary mace; only those of black hearts could make its magic operate. It had even more powers when wielded by a priest of Velsharoon , with its combat enchantments growing stronger, and the mace doubling the duration and impact of lich touch spells. Furthermore, those slain by a blow from the mace rose as zombies under the priest's command, and it was impossible to raise or resurrect them without anything short of a wish .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mace was found at the Sacristies of the Grim Skull within the recently built Chantry of St. Sammaster in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
