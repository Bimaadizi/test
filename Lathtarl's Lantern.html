<p>Lathtarl's Lantern (also seen as Latharl's Lantern ) was a small fishing village on the Sword Coast at the mouth of the Winding Water . It was close to Warlock's Crypt .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 11 th century DR , a pirate named Lathtarl crashed ashore here while fleeing the navy of Evermeet . With his ship destroyed, crew much reduced, and himself crippled, he improvised a plan to crash other unsuspecting vessels against the rocky shore. Word quickly spread among other pirates and slavers that this was a safe harbor—for them, at least.</p>
<p>The pirates eventually stopped crashing ships there after threats from merchants and the Lords of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>There were rumors of two dead kings who perished at the marsh at the mouth of the Winding Water: a rebel lord from Tethyr named King Tredarath and King Beverdaur of Cortryn .</p>
