<p>Goroth was a thief of the Moonclaws gang in the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a flat-eyed face with a cruel demeanor; he kept a fringe beard, and his red hair short-cropped. His gang wore black leathers , with a crossed dagger and moon emblem on the chest.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He wielded a bow.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had an archer's bracer, and a metal plate over his gut, under the leathers.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Moonclaws . Rival thief Farl knew his name, strongly implying they had met.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first encounter that Farl and Eladar the Dark (the incognito Prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar ) had with the Moonclaws was at a house they were burgling, where they were set upon by a trio of thieves entering through the window. Goroth was the only man among those three thieves. They tried to muscle Farl and Eladar out of their loot, but Eladar hurled Goroth out of a window after a short struggle; rather than try and contest him again, Goroth escaped.</p>
<p>He later participated in the ambush in which they attempted to slay the Velvet Hands guild Eladar and Farl had just founded. He was killed in that ambush; both Eladar and Farl recognized him afterwards.</p>
