<table border='1'><tr><th>Region</th><td>Faerûn</td></tr></table><br>
<p>The region of North Faerûn stretched from the frigid High Ice and the Anauroch desert in the north, south along the shores of the inland Moonsea lake in the northern region of Faerûn . It was a region of contrasting landscapes, including the lush forests of the Dalelands , the desolate sands of the Anauroch, the coastal cities of the Moonsea and Moonsea North regions, and the bitter colds lands of the the Ride .</p>
<h2>Regions</h2>
<h3>Anauroch</h3>
<p>The desert was once a rich, flourishing land claimed by the ancient Netherese Empire . After a terrible war marked by an ever-increasing magical arms race, the region was drained of all life and transformed into a desolate wasteland. This desert swallowed the human empires and survivor-states of this region, remaining sparsely populated by scattered desert tribes for centuries. The Netherese Empire reemerged in Faerûn during the 15 th century – following the arrival of the Thultanthar enclave from the Shadowfell – but once again collapsed as it had millennia prior.</p>
<h3>Eastern Heartlands</h3>
<p>With the exception of the Cormanthor forest, Eastern Heartlands were predominantly settled by groups of humans that shared cultural traditions including the same language.</p>
<h3>Moonsea North</h3>
<p>The wild lands north of Moonsea Lake were seen far and wide as largely inhospitable, with a wealth of natural resources that attracted those willing enough to seize them.</p>
<h3>The Vast</h3>
<p>This region along the eastern shore of the Dragon Reach was a temperate land of rolling farmlands, marked by the rugged peaks of the Earthfast Mountains and the forests along the eastern border with Impiltur . For much of its history the Vast comprised a number of city-states that each competed for their own interests, including Calaunt , Tantras , and Ravens Bluff . These powers came together to form the united nation of Vesperin , which rose to prominence in the region throughout the 15 th century DR.</p>
