<p>Tathlyn was a zealous drow and aggressive patron of the Ust Natha tavern , around 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tathlyn was often found in the tavern of Ust Natha, but was unwilling to share his tales with outsiders, unlike other patrons. He had apparently sawn tentacles from devourers, pried teeth from human babies and plunged daggers into a beholder. He assaulted the Vhaeraun supporter, Merinid , for the glory of Lolth. He wielded a two-handed sword in combat.</p>
