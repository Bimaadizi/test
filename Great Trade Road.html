<p>The Great Trade Road was a trail in Anauroch .</p>

<p>The road headed west from Bitter Well Oasis , and continued for roughly five days, maybe a little less, until it reached a pillar at which the trail turned north, towards the Well of the Chasm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point around 1368Â DR , a number of caravans went missing trying to find another way across the mountains. Those turned west instead of north at the pillar.</p>
