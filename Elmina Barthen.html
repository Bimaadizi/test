<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Barthen employed two local lads, Ander and Thistle , and was quite attached to an ox named Vincent .</p>
<p>Barthen had a good business relationship with Phandalin's Townmaster, Harbin Wester , and helped Harbin and his half-brother, Tibor Wester , to circumvent Neverwinter taxes by transporting supplies to the latter's logging business . Barthen also worked with agents of Dagult Neverember as they rebuilt Leilon , particularly the gnome goatherd Pinchwit Wigglehoof . Thanks to many contacts with wealthy merchants in Waterdeep , Barthen was able to broker major sales for local sellers from Phandalin and Leilon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1491 DR , Barthen and other townsfolk of Phandalin were constantly harassed by the Redbrands , which made local trade more difficult. She was willing to share information with anybody who wished to sort the Redbrands out.</p>
<p>During this time, a dwarf explorer and friend of Barthen named Gundren Rockseeker believed he had located the Wave Echo Cave . Elmina was excited by the potential discovery, and agreed to help supply Gundren and his brothers, Nundro and Tharden . Gundren had hired a new group of adventurers to bring a wagon full of equipment from Neverwinter to Barthen's Provisions, for which Barthen would agree to handover 10 gp each. Gundren let Barthen know that he would meet her at the store before the adventurers, however Gundren never arrived and his brothers both failed to show up to receive their resupplies. This led Barthen to worry.</p>
<p>By 1496 DR , Barthen had closed Barthen's Provisions and moved on from Phandalin.</p>
