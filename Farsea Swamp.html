<p>The Farsea Swamp was a massive stretch of wetlands located in the Eastern Heartlands of Faerûn . While the swamp was a place of pestilence and disease, it harbored a mysterious past that drew in adventurer's and supported some semblance of society among its humanoid inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The swamp was located on the western fringes of the nation of Cormyr . To the south was what remained of the dry Tunlands , east were the Storm Horns , and west were the Sunset Mountains and Far Hills .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The swamp gave birth to the great Tun River , that flowed south before emptying out into the Dragonmere . While most of the swamp's overflow passed through the south, it also flowed north into the Tunwash in the northwest, and the High Moors in the northeast.</p>
<p>Nestled in the southwest region of the swamp were the Fens of Tun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the formation of the swamp, the land it occupied was said to have been home to ancient civilization (unrelated to the ruined empire of Netheril ).</p>
<p>It formed when the Farsea Marshes joined with the Marsh of Tun some time after the Era of Upheaval .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>A number of named settlements could be found within the swamp, though not much was known about their size or demographics of their respective populations. Included among these were Wyrmhall, Swampgate, Nyka's Rest, Threetrees, and Swords Hollow.</p>
<p>Only one trail was known to have passed through the swamp, in its northern stretch, connecting the settlements of Aris and Eagle Peak .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A so-called kingdom of bandits made their home in the southern region of the Farsea Swamp, much like the Tun Bandits did in their namesake marsh circa the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
