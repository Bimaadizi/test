<p>Eylea was a small city somewhere in Faerûn in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>It was protected by Eylea Keep and was the base of the Avante Guard adventuring company .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After leaving Yhaunn in Sembia , the young wizard and would-be adventurer Black Dugal Buchannan went to Eylea to join the Avante Guard, but was declined for his lack of experience. Thus, Dugal joined the Eylea Keep garrison instead as a journeyman wizard, where he served for two years.</p>
<p>After the Avante Guard destroyed a temple used by an obscure cult circa 1340 DR , the cultists sent their minions and hired mercenaries, including ogres , trolls , drow , and even demons , against Eylea. The attack raged for two days before it was routed, leaving many dead. Sickened by battle, Dugal became a pacifist and retired, later establishing Black Dugal's Music Shoppe in Ravens Bluff by around 1357 DR .</p>
