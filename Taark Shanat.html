<p>Taark Shanat , known as the Crusader , was a dwarf and the founder of the kingdom of Shanatar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around −11,000 DR , Taark and his eight sons left Bhaerynden , leading a great migration of dwarves journeying westward, and sought to establish a new kingdom. These emigrants eventually took the name " shield dwarves ".</p>
<p>Around −10,800 DR , the Cloaker Wars broke out, in which Taark and his dwarves came up against the inhabitants of Rringlor Noroth . Taark slew four blue dragons in the Rift of Dhalnadar and the dwarves were victorious.</p>
<p>The skulls of the four blue dragons were brought together by a deity, probably Dumathoin , to form the Wyrmskull Throne , and the site was renamed Brightaxe Hall , founding the kingdom of Alatorin and this is what shield dwarves consider to mark the First Great Age of Shanatar . They founded the great empire of Shanatar beneath the lands that would later be known as Amn , Tethyr , Calimshan , and the Lake of Steam .</p>
