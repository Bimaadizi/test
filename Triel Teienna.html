<p>Triel Teienna was a drow priestess of Lolth who served as the High Priestess of the Temple of Lolth in Bezantur in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She enjoyed indulging in opulent pleasures, and used her position within Bezantur's temple to engage in such pursuits.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While she was technically the overseer of Lolth's temple in Bezantur, Triel only visited once every few months. Whenever she did, she would always select a handful of the human members of the congregation to accompany her back to the Underdark to "live" with their drow "brethren". Naturally, these chosen individuals they were never seen again.</p>
