<p>The Tower of the Art was the headquarters of Zhentil Keep 's makeshift wizards ' guild in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Tower was located in south Zhentil Keep in the western section of the Foreign Quarter along Twilight Street .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Tower of the Art stood ten stories tall and easily dominated the new skyline of Zhentil Keep. The Tower did not have a front door. Instead, when a visitor came to the Tower, the wizard on duty activated the magic of a granite slab upon which the visitor stood to teleport the visitor within the Tower. Visitors exited the Tower in the same manner.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Numerous laboratories, bedrooms, studies, libraries, lecture halls, and store rooms could be found within the Tower. The uppermost level was converted into an observatory.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>An entry fee into the guild was assessed for new wizards based up their current arcane skill. In addition, an annual fee was required that was also based on their skill. Non-guild wizards were allowed to use the facilities of the Tower at a rate of 25 gp per hour. They were constantly monitored by guild mages .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The guildmaster of the Tower of the Art was a native Zhent named Thagdal in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The entire Tower was warded to prevent outside access via teleportation , gates , plane shifting , or blinking . The same wards blocked any outside scrying attempts or movement by astral or ethereal creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Tower was previously owned by a powerful archmage , but a group of wizards banded together for survival during the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , and claimed it for themselves.</p>
