<p>Tresco Maynard , also known as the Practitioner or the Ermine , was a mage , scholar, and advisor who lived in Tethyr during the mid-to-late 15 th century DR . He served as a member of the Branch of Linden , a political faction that sought to depose Queen Anais Rhindaun , and eradicate elves from the kingdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a rather handsome man, with graying hair and a powerful build, that belied his advanced age.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In his youth, Tresco had a keen mind and was prone to obsessive studying. His mind tended to wander in his later years and he had lost much of his mental acuity. He was a noted misogynist who greatly underestimated the intellect of the women in his life, and treated them as objects to merely protect.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>For a very brief time, Tresco remained in possession of the artifact known as the Torque , a single link in the chain that imprisoned the being known as the Captive .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tresco spent much of his time in his familial estate of Kinnard Keep . He served as the personal instructor for the young lad Daviel , and tutored Teague , the son of Evonne Linden , and nephew of Queen Anais Rhindaun. After Evonne and Teague were slain in two terrible murders on the same night, Tresco took on Ysabel, Evonne's daughter, as his own ward. Unfortunately for the young girl, Tresco kept her locked away, purportedly for her own safety.</p>
<p>The old mage lived a second life away from the court of Tethyr. As the Practitioner , Tresco oversaw Vankila Slab prison, which sat atop an earthmote floating over the realm of Muranndin . There he performed horrific magical experiments on hapless prisoners, carrying on the research of his dear patron, the late Evonne Linden.</p>
<p>He had a fondness for black leaf , and enjoyed playing Scaffold Knights and Routacelle .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was especially close to Evonne Linden , and considered part of his life's work to carry on her vision for the nation of Tethyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the years before her passing, Evonne Linden offered to Tresco her research on ancient sarrukh magic. She encouraged him to lead an expedition to Chult , in order to find a powerful artifact and unknown wealth in the lost city of Hisari .</p>
<p>Tragedy struck Tethyr in the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR , when elves of the Wealdath attacked the Winter Palace at a gathering of nobles and members of the royal family. Tresco was one of three people who survived the killing, along with Ysabel Linden and her "rescuer", Declan Cardew . Evonne Linden was killed that same night in the village of Celleu .</p>
<p>Determined to carry on her legacy, Tresco Maynard bided his time for the right moment to act. He continued Evonne's research by experimenting on the prisoners of Vankila Slab. He traveled to Chult many times over the course of the next decade, working on a 'blood machine' that used the life essence of individuals, to create living clones .</p>
<h3>Downfall</h3>
<p>Using Evonne's notes, Tresco uncovered the location of an artifact known as the Torque , hidden within the lost sarrukh city of Hisari . Tresco planned to use the Torque to consolidate his power as the head of a new dynasty in Tethyr. He arranged for the "Hero of the Realm" Declan Cardew to retrieve the Torque from Chult, prior to Cardew's marriage to the recently-of-age Ysabel. Tresco would then depose Queen Anais from the throne, before installing Cardew and Ysabel as king and queen, regents he could manipulate from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The conspiracy was successful in part. Where Cardew failed in his quest, a group of adventurers led by Harp Levesque succeeded. Unfortunately for them, Tresco seized the Torque from their possession, and portalled himself back to Kinnard Keep. Once home, Tresco discovered he had been artfully out-maneuvered. The girl he knew as Ysabel held the soul of his former patron, the girl's own mother, Evonne Linden. Evonne had manipulated Tresco and Cardew into retrieving for her an elixer containing the blood of the Captive —a task at which they had miserably failed. Ysabel-Evonne viciously killed Tresco for his incompetence.</p>
