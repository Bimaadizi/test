<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nestled beneath Pine Tree Mountain , Bingo served as a crucial hub at the base of a major agricultural valley. It was the administrative center for the Niwa shoen .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>

To facilitate this, two large godowns were constructed within the village, vigilantly monitored by a sentry. Primarily stocked with rice , these godowns also stored a variety of other commodities, including cloth, tea , iron ore, and even traces of gold and silver ore. Among the underworld and societal outcasts, there were whispers that these godowns concealed even greater treasures.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
