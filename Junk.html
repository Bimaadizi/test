<p>A junk was a type of sailing ship found mainly in Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A large sailing vessel, a junk had a flat bottom with a high keel and no stern. They had two masts supporting sails that were fully battened, that is, reinforced with bamboo ribs. The hull would be partitioned into several small compartments; watertight, these made a junk exceptionally seaworthy.</p>
<p>Junks came in various sizes and for different purposes, with small junks, large junks, and war junks all known. A T'u Lung war junk might have a length of 60 feet (18.3 meters) and in ideal conditions sail at a speed of up to 80 miles (129 kilometers) per day, with a crew of only five. A typical large junk could have a length of up to 80 feet (24 meters), a beam width of 20 feet (6.1 meters), a height of 10 feet (3 meters) above the waterline and a draft of 10 feet (3 meters) below it. It sailed at 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) per hour.</p>
<p>A small junk could carry 17 passengers while a large junk could carry 25 passengers; a horse or similar beast took up the space of four people. A typical large junk could carry up to fifty people, requiring seven crew on watch. It could carry a cargo of up to 160 tons (145 metric tons).</p>
<p>A war junk could be armed with a ship ram .</p>
<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>A small junk typically cost 300 ch'ien , a large junk 500 ch'ien, and a war junk 800 chi'ein. A typical large junk could cost 15,000 gold pieces and took 3 months to construct.</p>
<p>The wu jen spell vessel could conjure a seaworthy junk from a single piece of origami -folded paper that could sail itself by magic. However, it only lasted a worryingly short time. Magical paper of forms could do the same.</p>
<h2>In Kara-Tur</h2>
<p>Junks were commonly used in the seas of Kara-Tur in the 14th century DR . For example, junks were used in Kozakura . The Imperial Navy had some twenty large war junks among lesser vessels.</p>
<p>Junks were also sailed around Koryo .</p>
<p>Junks were used in T'u Lung, both by agents of the realm and by the navy, but these could be pretty shabby.</p>
<p>Merchant junks regularly sailed between Shou Lung and Wa and from T'u Lung.</p>
<p>The notorious wako pirates that plagued the seas regularly made use of junks. Usually disguised as traders, they often preyed on Shou Lung shipping to Wa.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the year 1200 by Koryoan reckoning, in Koryo, a great many refugees fled the city of Karak by junks, journeying down the coast to Tu Pe . They moored their ships at the Long Pier, creating a neverending traffic jam that trapped still more vessels and steadily grew and evolved into a veritable "floating city".</p>
