<p>Withegroo Seian'Doo was a wizard who lived in Shallows , where he had his own tower. He founded and led the hamlet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Withegroo looked old and had a white beard. He had a wrinkly face, large ears, and a hawk-like nose. His white hair was unkempt. He stood over 6 feet (1.83 meters) tall. He wore red robes with gold stars (similar to the pennant hanging from his tower) and a pointy hat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Withegroo made a name and a fortune for himself by adventuring in caves and fighting creatures. He used the money to build himself a tower, and it gradually turned into a town as more and more people came to live in safe proximity.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , during the orc and frost giant attack on Shallows, Withegroo was hit by a hurled boulder while on top of his tower, and was seriously injured. Fortunately, he was healed by the dwarven cleric Rockbottom .</p>
<p>Ultimately, Withegroo fell, when a horde of orcs and worgs came charging into the town. His final act was to cast a fireball , blasting some of the orcs and stopping the charge, but the exertion cost him dearly. He managed a smile as he launched his devastating bomb, then he looked at Catti-brie and winked. He fell over dead giving into his injuries.</p>
