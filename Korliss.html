<p>Korliss was a True Soul of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers 's kitchens during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Korliss, a Waterdhavian wizard , received a call of the new and growing Cult. She followed the calling to the Moonrise Towers in the Western Heartlands , the Cult of the Absolute's heart, where she received the favor of the Cult's leader, Ketheric Thorm and became a True Soul through the Cult's illithid tadpole infection.</p>
<p>Now seeing the Cult fully, Korliss was sent into the shadow-cursed lands to find the closest non-Absolutist heretics. However, she was unprotected from the grave dangers of the Cult and was pursued by ravenous shadow mastiffs to the edge of ruined Reithwin . She managed to scare the mastiffs and their alpha with fire and erected a field of magical light to keep them at bay. However, she still did not survive, dying of unslaked hunger and unquenched thirst.</p>
