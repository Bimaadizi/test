<p>Nexal was the capital of the greatest empire in Maztica .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Nexal was both the name of the empire and the city-state that conquered and controlled it. The empire itself covered the Valley of Nexal , Pezelac , Huacli (with the exception of Otomi), and Kolan . The city-state of Nexal was a grand city located on an island in the center of the lakes in the Valley of Nexal, thus occupying a central position in the Valley itself.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Nexal was inhabited by humans, primarily of the Maztican ethnic group, although the original Nexalans had been a tribe of Dog People . They spoke the Nexalan language , and were fierce warriors and devoted to the god Zaltec , who was their patron god.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The Nexalan had a fierce, warlike culture, and were devoted to their patron god Zaltec. They were ruled by a Revered Counselor, but the high priest of Zaltec, as well as military leaders, had a great deal of influence.</p>
<p>The Nexalans regularly practiced human sacrifice, holding Feathered Wars when captives were scarce. They sacrificed the most to Zaltec, but also honored Azul and Tezca greatly.</p>
<p>Nexalan merchants were known to travel as far as the cities of Far Payit to trade. They placed more emphasis on aesthetics than substance in art, with things tending to be gaudy and ostentatious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>The ancient Nexalans were a tribe of the Dog People, living far from the Valley of Nexal in the vast northern desert. One night, though, the shaman of that tribe, Tecco, had a vision. This vision caused him to journey through the desert for a full year before he found a massive, artificially constructed cavern, in which he found a stone pillar. Before his very eyes, this pillar turned into a living statue of the god Zaltec, which gave him a prophecy commanding him and his tribe to go south. The image then faded back into a crude statue of the god, and Tecco carried the statue back to his tribe, repeating the exact prophecy all the way. The tribe then set out, heading south.</p>
<p>Years later, when Tecco's grandson Cattl was shaman, they came to the Valley of Nexal, and claimed a small island in the center of the lakes on which to build their village. Here they built a pyramid to Zaltec as well, on which they placed the stone pillar that Tecco had carried back to them and they had carried with them for so long. They also pledged fealty to the greatest city-state in the Valley at the time, Tezat, and fought for it in the Valley's constant wars. In this time they grew strong and multiplied, until they made their move many years later.</p>
<p>The ancient Nexalans were fierce warriors, and Tezat came to rely on them in its fighting, for with their aid Tezat came close to conquering the entire Valley of Nexal. But the Nexalans allied with their rivals, Azatl and Zokik, and in a single campaign conquered their former ally, and then used threats and diplomacy to subdue the other city-states of the Nexal Valley. With these victories, their town grew into a city, and they took for themselves a new name, "Nexala".</p>
<h3>The Empire</h3>
<p>The empire Nexal built, starting with their betrayal of Tezat, was ruled by Revered Counselors. The 15 Revered Counselors that ruled, over the course of 299 years, provided an easier way to record their history.</p>
<p>Later, after Qotal 's return and Mount Zatal's eruption, people from Nexal fled south, along the series of oases created by Qotal in the House of Tezca, and settled in the valley in the desert's center, founding the city of Tukan.</p>
