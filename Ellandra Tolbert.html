<p>Ellandra Tolbert was born to a famous anatomist father from a noble House Tolbert of Neverwinter , and from her early years, she assisted Lord Tolbert's work—anatomical dissections. The family suffered a great loss when Ellandra was just thirteen winters old. The family estate was torched and burned down, leaving Ellandra the only survivor. A disgruntled serf perpetrated the arson that left the young girl's face badly scarred. The loss of the family estate did not affect Ellandra's commitment to her father's work, and with time, she joined the Anatomical Academy on Sahu , the Homeland of the Necromancer Kings, and later, to Waterdeep . Her initial focus was curing or hiding the facial disfigurements – this was the genesis of the false face spell.
