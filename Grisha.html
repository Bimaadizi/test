<p>Circa 1482 DR , Grisha saw a minotaur horde march against the village but then be destroyed by the demon lord Yeenoghu . So Grisha devoted himself to the gnoll god and soon the cult of Yeenoghu gained control of Filthriddens with Grisha as their leader.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A strict ruler, Grisha believed he sensed the power of Yeenoghu in all things and that he was behind the cultists being resurrected as ghouls after they died.</p>
