<p>Nethentir was a city of Thay located within the tharch of Lapendrar , just beneath the First Escarpment on the northern shore of Lake Umber . It was an important settlement that took in heavy caravan traffic and housed a large fortress and a number of legion outposts that guarded a series of switchback trails that led up to the Thayan Plateau .</p>
<p>Nethentir was the sister-town of Nethjet , though it never attained the same level of prosperity. Together they served as the starting point for a number of Thayan invasions into the lands of Thesk and Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In addition, Nethentir had a great many businesses and inns that served the outlanders who entered Thay from the west. Bored and unruly gnolls and Thayan legionnaires regularly wreaked havoc in the city's establishments, starting brawls and harassing passersby. When soldiers arrived in Nethentir on leave, citizens were prepared to bar the doors of their homes or make arrangements to leave town for a short while.</p>
<p>Nethentir had a port that opened up into Lake Umber, and many sea captains of the city shipped their goods to Nethjet and back. While no major Thayan roads extended into the city, many merchants established their own overland trade routes, and typically evaded the attention of the Red Wizards .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nethentir fell into ruin during the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , when the upheaval of the Thayan Plateau and eruption of the Thaymount caused the entire region to become broken and transformed into the Bonedark Hills .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , Thayan forces began rebuilding and reinforcing Nethentir into a ringed fortress known as a Dread Ring , and patrols of Thayan troops (including undead increased around the city.</p>
