<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although thought to be extinct, Mount Thulbane was merely dormant.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck Toril in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , much of the upper levels of the ground collapsed into the Underdark below and sparked geological activity across the lands. Mount Thulbane became active once more, and continuously filled the skies above with black ash that darkened the skies and allowed undead dragons to roam wild during all hours of the day.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to local myths, Mount Thulbane was home to the god Assuran , the Untheric god of vengeance.</p>
