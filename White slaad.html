<p>White slaadi , also known as chronos slaads , were a rare and powerful type of slaad with powers over time and the ability to harness chaos itself.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>White slaadi appeared as frightening humanoid toads with pale skin so white that it seemed to glow when hit by even faint light.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>White slaadi were creatures of pure chaos, more in touch with the true principle of chaos than common slaads. They were focused on studying an art form even more deadly than that of the macabre-obsessed death slaadi , namely the manipulation of raw chaos. They also possessed a unique and uncanny understanding of time, realizing that time itself was merely an illusion that could, if briefly, be broken.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>White slaadi were immensely powerful and dangerous, more so than most other slaadi, with their very blood oozing with pure chaos. The chaos they harnessed burnt through everything it touched like acid, quickly and persistently destroying it with not even spells like magic circle against chaos able to fully protect against the degradation. They could infect others with it by biting them and they could spew gobs of chaos at enemies up to 60 feet (18 meters) away. The destructive slaadi could break things with incredible ease and their attacks had a tendency to stun and daze those they struck.</p>
<p>They also had the ability to split themselves into temporal duplicates, weaker copies of themselves pulled from the past and future into the present with the same goals. They could only manifest a limited number of replicas at once, typically six, and once all were defeated the original would suddenly appear within a few feet of the last defeated clone.</p>
<p>Otherwise, white slaadi possessed many of the same powers as the death slaadi, with similar, yet more ruinous, spell -like abilities; the ability to take on a humanoid form; and the power to summon other slaadi, namely gray or death slaadi.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>White slaadi occasionally trained to be fighters , sometimes wielding enchanted weapons but only if they were on par with their natural powers. They often charged directly into combat, tried to daze opponents, and splitting into copies when pressured.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>White slaadi were exceedingly scarce creatures; even natives to Limbo rarely recognized them when encountered. In a process similar to how a green slaad became a gray slaad, a death slaad over a century old could retreat into solitude for over a year, returning as a more powerful white slaad. By undergoing a similar process after another century, a white slaad could transform into a black slaad .</p>
