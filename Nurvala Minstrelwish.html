<p>Nurvala Minstrelwish was a brewmaster and part owner of the Moon Mountain Brewery on the Unicorn Run in northwest Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nurvala was a hard worker and expected everyone (even the youngsters) to pull their weight. Profit was a strong motivator among the brewery's leadership and they put the maximum effort into producing and delivering fine products. Pesky details like repairs were put off as long as possible and then patched quickly with near minimal effort.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was a skilled brewmaster with knowledge about all aspects of the trade, from growing the crops to shipping the finished product to customers. It was her ancestor's recipe that she used to brew their signature Moon Mountain Ale . She also knew how to concoct two poisons , bittermint and tulade , that could be mixed with alcohol and used natural ingredients found in the vicinity of the brewery.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nurvala was one of the three brewmasters that knew one of their frequent customers, a human trader named Tarth Brallowgath , also represented the Black Network . She took extra payments from Brallowgath to smuggle small items of value and coded messages in their shipments of spirits. Most of the staff were skilled at making barrels and casks with separate compartments, like topkegs , so adding a secret compartment to a keg was not a big challenge. Nurvala had no qualms about smuggling, but she fretted on the rare occasions when Brallowgath ordered them to poison a particular keg for delivery to a specific customer. If the poisoned brew should go astray or be discovered, she worried they would all be out of business and even suffer retribution. She and her two cohorts, Yarimmur Borulglar and Kelter Minstrelwish , nervously relied on the Zhentarim for protection as well as the extra coin.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Even those of the staff that were not directly related to her called her "Mother" and "Old Chin". Most of the halflings residing at Moon Mountain felt that something unusual was going on between Brallowgath and the leadership, but thought it was better not to know the details.</p>
