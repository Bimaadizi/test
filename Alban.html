<p>Alban was a wight and the ruler of the city Mictlatepec in Maztica .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alban was the king of the city of Mictlatepec, an administrative center of the old Zateca people, who once dominated the area that the Huacli later inhabited. The arrogant Alban decided that he wanted to reign forever, so he instructed the royal hishnashaper to create a talisman that would allow him to do so. The hishnashaper thus created the talisman of perpetual life , which Alban wore always from that point forward.</p>
<p>However, at the time of his death, Alban rose again as a mictlanec ("dead one"). In fury, Alban slew some of the hishnashapers with his new powers. Afterward, however, he came to appreciate his new form and ordered the surviving hishnashapers to forge an artifact able to create more mictlaneca. They created the knife of perpetual service , which transformed all people killed with it into various lesser kinds of mictlaneca, becoming ghasts , ghouls , or zombies , according to their former social standing.</p>
<p>Alban eventually killed all the city's inhabitants. They continued to reenact each night the same things they did as living beings, while hiding in tombs and tunnels during the day. Alban himself remained in the palace complex of Mictlatepec, ruling the City of the Dead.</p>
