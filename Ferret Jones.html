<h2>History</h2>
<p>"Ferret" Jones was born into the life of crime. His father was a smuggler, and Ferret took on the same trade as he reached adulthood. Unfortunately, unlike his dad, Ferret became notorious for his bad luck, often losing supplies and shipments. This did not earn him any friends, and only angered his clients, such as the Zhentarim. Unbeknownst to all, however, Jones was pocketing the "lost" shipments, stockpiling them in a secure spot for future use.</p>
