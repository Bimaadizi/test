<p>The Death Dells , also called Yeenoghu's Realm or the Seeping Woods , was the 422 nd layer of the Abyss . It was the realm of the demon prince Yeenoghu .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Death Dells were a sweltering realm lit by a low-hanging red sun. The central region was the Dun Savannah, inhabited by feral gnolls and dominated by Yeenoghu. It was bordered to the north by the Screaming Peaks, beyond which was Azael's Waste, the last remnant of the former ruler's realm and the one region that Yeenoghu could not shape to his will. The Seeping Woods proper formed the traditional western border to Yeenoghu's wanderings, while the Curswallow sea to the east touched upon the Abyssian Ocean .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Yeenoghu's fortress was a massive iron construction pulled around his realm by innumerable slaves. It made stops at the three main encampments, Vujak-Sesko, Vujak-Riln, and Vujak-Kesk, as well as the Great Gate, a portal that could be manipulated to open to many Material worlds and which was used to resupply Yeenoghu with slaves, and Bechard's Landing, a spit of rock on the shores of the Curswallow where the ancient obyrith had spent millenia dying a slow death.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Death Dells were primarily inhabited by countless gnolls and other creatures that served Yeenoghu, such as hyenodons , hyenas , and shoosuvas . It was also inhabited less willingly by countless mortal slaves that served as laborers and food, some of whom were fortunate enough to escape.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the layer was ruled by the obyrith lord Bechard , who was eventually felled by tanar'ri treachery, his connection to the layer severed. After him the demon lord Azael ruled the layer, which became a vast desert of shifting dunes and ruined cities under his reign. However, after the bestial god-killer Ma Yuan briefly visited the layer, only an oily stain was left of Azael. Yeenoghu later rose to become the next ruler of the layer.</p>
