<p>Art Cullagh was a member of the Flaming Fist who served Grand Duke Eltan in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Art was a human man with olive skin and short curly black hair. His hands had calluses typical of a musician who played a stringed musical instrument .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Flame Cullagh of Baldur's Gate was ordered to infiltrate the Moonrise Towers in order to investigate its ancestral Thorm family. Art was personally tasked with the investigation by Grand Duke Eltan. The Grand Duke had become aware of a corruption that had begun spreading through the towers and the town of Reithwin in addition to rumors of a Sharran enclave emerging in the area. Art was to rent a room at the Last Light Inn and work from there, starting with the investigation of the town's House of Healing .</p>
<p>However, Flame Cullagh was among those consumed by the Shadow-cursed Lands when the town was enveloped by a Sharran curse . Unlike many others, Art survived, his mind addled. He was found wandering in the shadows in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR by the Harpers led by the High Harper Jaheira and the Flaming Fist under Councilor Florrick . His now catatonic yet still-living body was laid down in the Last Light Inn. Fist J'ehlar attended to the comatose man, who was unresponsive and only mumbled lyrics of an ancient song. His condition was a spiritual malaise; his mind was gripped by the Shadowfell , but he remained human as the world of darkness failed to break Art's mind fully. Fist J'ehlar was trying to help the catatonic man in order to find out any information about Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard , who had been kidnapped and dragged into the Moonrise Towers.</p>
<p>It is unknown if Flame Cullagh was woken up, remained bed-ridden, or if he survived when the shadow curse finally consumed the Last Light Inn.</p>
