<p>The Adjudicators ( Schatjamaetrish in Tymantheran ) were an organization of dragonborn soldiers gathered from every clan , who served as the police force of Djerad Thymar under the direct command of the Vanquisher . When there was a crime a dragonborn clan could not handle on their own, it was the duty of the Adjudicators to take care of it.</p>
<p>Members of the Adjudicators used golden beads beneath their eyes as piercings, mimicking the same kind of piercings used by the Vanquisher.</p>
