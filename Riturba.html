<p>House Riturba was a noble family of Sumbria , one of the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1217 DR House Riturba fell on hard times, and they loaned a significant sum of ducats from Gilberto Ilégo, a Blade Captain from a major Blade House of Sumbria. Ilégo was a cold, power-hungry, and cruel man. The Blade Captain foreclosed on House Riturba's loan, s deed that caused outrage. House Riturba accused Gilberto Ilégo of being a contemptible cheat, in response, Ilégo challenged the young noble Riturba accuser to a duel.</p>
<p>The duel took place during the Blade Festival that followed one of the Blade Kingdoms' annual "white wars." The Riturba youth was no match for a master duelist. The youth fenced using a rapier and a buckler , while Gilberto Ilégo used a rapier and a short swordbreaker . The House Riturba nobleman was slain in the duel, surrounded by witnesses and overseen by a gray-bearded umpire.</p>
