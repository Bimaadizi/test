<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lazlo Buckman was a tall, strong, red-faced man with a serious demeanor and chiseled features.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lazlo was a member of the West Harbor militia, who fought against the bladelings and duergar in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . Despite the military career, he also brewed the famous Harvest Mead and later, Harbor Mead , using an old family recipe.</p>
<p>Lazlo survived the Second War of the Shadow and returned back to West Harbor. After Georg Redfell died, Laszlo became the new mayor of West Harbor . While he repaired the damage with the other surviving villagers, undead attacked them. To keep the village safe, he bribed two black dragons , Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor , with Harbor Mead to stop the attacks. Once he ran out of the mead that the dragons came to love, Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor were infuriated, capturing Tarmas , the village's wizard . Lazlo tasked a group of adventurers who worked with merchant Sa'Sani , with freeing Tarmas, and then to attack the dragons, in exchange for establishing trade relationship with West Harbor. Lazlo claimed that the dragons simply sought to destroy the town, withholding the information about the previous arrangement with them.</p>
