They were fortunate to find temporary safe haven at the Emerald Grove , by grace of Master Halsin . That security was ended however when a druid named Kagha tried to seal away the grove from the tieflings, by means of a ritual .</p>
<p>While at druidic enclave, Locke and Komira's daughter Arabella tried to steal the idol of Silvanus from the druids, in order to nullify the ritual. Arabella was taken by Kagha and her allies, and forced to answer for her misdeed.
