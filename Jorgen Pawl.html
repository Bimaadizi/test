<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jorgen was a strong dracolich traditionalist. He was nominated as commander of the recently conquered Xonthal's Tower, a bastion of Cult traditionalists.</p>
<p>As a compromise with the Cult's traditionalists, the reformist leader Severin gave the blue dragon mask to Jorgen to examine. However, Jorgen's second-in-command Iskander betrayed the Cult to the Council of Waterdeep .
Jorgen understood Iskander's feelings but he was not ready to betray the Cult, so when Iskander's treachery was unveiled, Jorgen ordered his death. Soon after, he was presumed killed by a band of adventurers sent by the Council in response to a message from Iskander.</p>
