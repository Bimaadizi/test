<p>The Dark Eight was a coven of pit fiend generals who resided on Nessus , the ninth layer of the Nine Hells . They plotted and strategized the movements of Hell's armies.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Originally the Dark Eight had nine members, but after the death of their founder Cantrum, the remaining eight renamed the council rather than attempting to find a substitute for their irreplaceable leader.</p>
<p>Contrary to what one might expect, their structure was democratic rather than hierarchical, where one member's actions could be voted on by the remaining seven. Befitting beings of law, the members of the Dark Eight were excellent in regards to teamwork, cooperating to accomplish their grand plans and for the continued prosperity of the baatezu . At the same time, the pit fiends of the council were still ambitious devils that viewed one another as rivals. More often than not, council members were left to their own devices, engaging in treacherous intrigues and political power plays to achieve their nebulous aims. Keeping the Dark Eight focused on their duties was Asmodeus , sometimes directly and at others via the archdevils . Unlike the infernal nobility above them, the Dark Eight were generals and each member was responsible for managing one aspect of the Blood War according to their personal judgement.</p>
<p>Historians of Hell were often baffled by the Dark Eight's apparent immortality, as even after eons of conflict every member outside of Cantrum himself remained in power. This was despite the fact that the Dark Eight fought personally in the battlefields of the Blood War while still having to contend with the regular assassination attempts and internal conflicts of Hell. While it would appear that they managed to maintain their longevity through guile and cunning rather than magical powers, the very idea that the original Dark Eight remained in power was a devilish deception. In order to create the illusion of an invincible authority, members of the Dark Eight were swiftly replaced by a physically altered pit fiend formerly under their command whenever one could no longer fulfill their duties. Combined with the loyalty of and threats of execution to those under their command, the secret of the Dark Eight had been kept for eons. The only surviving founding member of the Dark Eight was Baalzephon (see details below).</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Dark Eight controlled not only the Blood War, but influenced every part of baatezu culture, particularly in ensuring that Hell's edicts matched the desires of the archdevils without overwhelming the common baatezu. Occasionally, members of the Dark Eight left Hell and entered other planes in mortal guise to search for information and power, only revealing their true forms when in dire need or to deal with irritating entities. The names of the original Dark Eight correlated with their duties and each possessed a garrison of forces on one of Hell's circles excluding Nessus .</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Ministries corresponding to each member of the Dark Eight were present throughout the Nine Hells and at least one of each type existed on every layer. Through these ministries the Dark Eight controlled almost every part of a devil's life and even in the event of the complete destruction of one branch emergency procedures were devised to continue their efforts. Devils of greater status were more closely monitored in Baator and baatezu wishing to be promoted had to meet an immovable set of criteria. If there weren't enough devils that met the requirements for promotion than a caste would be understaffed until enough competent devils rose up, although there were punishments for superiors if not enough devils could ascend or they tried to fill out the ranks with fodder.</p>
<p>Every century, the Dark Eight gathered in a ceremony called the Ring of Cantrum with 100 osyluths in order to decide the promotion of the gelugons specifically. The osyluths gathered in a ring around the Dark Eight and provided information about the exploits and ethics of the recruits, making up one out of the nine votes.</p>
<p>A rumor had recently emerged that the Dark Eight was planning a dangerous, lengthy, and monumental magical ritual known as The Bringing. It involved the sacrifice of a million soul larva that would be consumed in the process as fuel in order to help annihilate the tanar'ri. The baatezu had recently been purchasing soul larvae from the night hags at an increased rate although whether or not the ceremony was really being planned was unknown.The Dark Eight was also responsible for creating certain fiendish races like the maelephants and one of the Chiefs of Research had worked with Tiamat to create the abishai.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>As the buffer between the Abyss and the rest of the Nine Hells, Avernus was run not by dukes and duchesses but by the Dark Eight. From within the inner regions of his Bronze Citadel, Bel strategized with the Dark Eight and so each possessed a household within his fortress. The Dark Eight were said to descend into Nessus four times a year to hold meetings with Asmodeus about their upcoming plans for the Blood War, although other reports stated they met every sixty-six days. This was also the site where they discussed potential promotions, passed down their decrees to the greater and lesser baatezu and generally spent their time when not commanding their forces.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Hidden within their base in Malsheem, the Dark Eight were rumored to keep the dagger of Ra-than, a sacred baatezu artifact of great historical significance despite it being a simple enchanted weapon.Its symbolic importance was great enough that the tanar'ri wished to acquire it in order to demoralize Hell's legions and possible even throw their forces into chaos.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Outside of Bel, the Dark Eight rarely interacted with the archdevils and when they did it was to handle their mandates or compete for recruits. The archdevils completely surpassed the Dark Eight in terms of power and influence, and were perfectly content to allow the pit fiends to deal with the Blood War so they could focus on their own affairs.</p>
<p>The one exception to this rule was Bel, who used to serve under one of the Marshalls of the Pit and who had proved himself as a masterful warlord and devious schemer. Bel was given his position as Archdevil after overthrowing Zariel by Asmodeus on the condition that he continued to assist the Dark Eight, now serving as their leader against the Abyss. It was due to Bel's personal involvement in the Blood War that the Dark Eight supported his command and loyally served him, giving him increased protection from the normal cutthroat politics of Baator.</p>
<p>Other devils had varying opinions of the Dark Eight ranging from completely loyalty to utter loathing. 106 cornugons were said to defend the Dark Eight with their lives, either out of terror or loyalty, and to join the guard regiment was a highly coveted position. Amnizus on the other hand sought to undermine the Dark Eight in any way possible, even ordering their servants to attack the minions of their superiors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although no baatezu could remember a time before the Dark Eight's rule, all were aware of Cantrum and the council's original state as the Dark Nine. There were several stories about the true origin of the Dark Eight and whether the pit fiends banded together on their own or if one of the archdevils were behind their existence.</p>
<p>Some said that Asmodeus formed the Dark Eight after an attempted rebellion by several archdevils as a form of reward for their loyalty that took power away from Baator's nobles while securing himself their obedience, and by extension the obedience of most baatezu. While Asmodeus viewed the Blood War as pointless, he saw its worth as a distraction and so unbeknownst to the pit fiends brought them together to perpetuate the endless battle. In others it was said that Cantrum formed the Dark Eight in order to bring a greater order to the baatezu, joining with like-minded pit fiends to achieve discipline throughout Baator.</p>
<p>Regardless of the original reason for their formation, Cantrum was eventually assassinated, although how was another matter of legend. The most well-known version of the story had a paladin named Ra-than crusading through Hell using a magical dagger forged in the Outlands . After slaying countless fiends for nearly a year he managed to reach Cantrum on the 333rd day and stab him in the heart, a move that killed Cantrum instantly even though the paladin never escaped Baator.</p>
<p>Another version of the story was found in the ice of Cania within a ragged journal and was the one believed by most baatezu. In this telling of the tale, the paladin quickly perished within an hour of entering Baator, but a red abishai found the dagger and murdered Cantrum out of frustration with Hell's rigid caste system. Cantrum was said to have killed the abishai in his last moments but the story served as a message to baatezu of all stations. To the greater baatezu it was a cautionary tale not to underestimate what ambition and anger could do to even powerful beings, and to the lesser baatezu it was a hopeful, inspirational legend about how even the lowly and looked down on could change the system with enough courage and determination.</p>
