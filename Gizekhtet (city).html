<p>Gizekhtet , also known as Quietude , was a city in the divine realm of the same name .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The buildings of Gizekhtet were constructed primarily from brick and white stucco. The River Isis ran through its center, providing cool clear water to its inhabitants. Within the city limits, this water acted as holy water .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Gizekhtet had a matriarchal government, though all were judged equally under its law and the sexes lived without enmity. The goddess Isis lived in and watched over the city. Under her purview, the city was ruled by Lamia Nightblossom , a tiefling wizardess whose character was marked by compassion, fairness, and justice. Isis trusted her implicitly with rulership of Gizekhtet whenever she was away.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This city was primarily inhabited by the petitioners of Isis, many of which came from the nation of Mulhorand , whom lived lives of balance and moderation in all matters. The people lived in true equality with one another, never lacking or having an overabundance of anything essential. Though there were still those who could comparatively be considered somewhat "poor" or "wealthy," as well as craftsfolk and workers.</p>
