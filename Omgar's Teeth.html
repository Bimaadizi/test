<p>Omgar's Teeth was a rocky patch of reefs and shallows along the eastern shores of Samar Bay , across from the Snout of Omgar . The Teeth were to the south of Samargol , the capital of Samarach , the Hidden Kingdom.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Teeth was a sandy beach with perilous jagged rocks sticking out of the shores and from the waters. Palm trees grew in abundance along the shore, and the land was regularly raided by local Batiri goblins in search of shipwrecks, lost cargo, and survivors. Sporadic bands of gnolls , orcs , and wandering undead were known to appear there. Patrols of Samarach regularly passed along Omgar's Teeth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a merchant vessel that traveled from the Sword Coast to Samarach was caught in a deadly storm off the shores of the Chultan Peninsula . The cracked remnants of the Vigilant were tossed onto the sharp rocks of Omgar's Teeth and several survivors of the wreck reached the safety of the shores in a small boat. Among the survivors were the renowned writer Volothamp Geddarm and several adventurers and sailors of the Vigilant . Soon after the wreck, Omgar's Teeth became a site of the battle between the survivors of the crash and several bands of man-eating Batiri led by Clawkeeper Kzheemoc , Ghzermag the Wild , and Shoudul of the Skulls .</p>
