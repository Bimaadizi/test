<p>Nanfoodle Buswilligan was a gnome alchemist of Mirabar .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had a little knowledge of illusionism .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>He was a long-term personal friend of Shoudra Stargleam and was hired by Marchion Elastul Raurym to work his alchemy in Mirabar.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nanfoodle was around 3 ft 5 in (100 cm) tall with a long crooked nose. He was bald other than a semicircle of white hair on the back of his head from ear to ear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nanfoodle created a process whereby existing metals were enhanced with adamantine flakes. He had previously attempted to get the same result using lead , but found that this only weakened the original metal. Marchion Elastul was disappointed at this result, not noticing any benefits over creating an alloy.</p>
<p>Since his arrival in Mirabar, Nanfoodle attempted to avoid involvement in the politics of the city.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Nanfoodle was ordered by Marchion Elastul Raurym to travel to Mithral Hall with Shoudra Stargleam in order to sabotage the industry there. He refused to do so and started helping Bruenor on his adventures. He helped multiple times when King Obould tried to take down Mithral Hall because of it's advantageous position to the north by designing a gas pipeline rig under Garumn's Gorge, setting the mountain ridge ablaze, taking out a number of Gerti Orelsdottr's frost giant troops, comparative to Eliminster's blast. He was helpful to the Companions of the Hall . After Bruenor and his entourage returned from the city of Baffenburg, Nanfoodle and Regis restored several tapestries and books they had brought back.</p>
<p>In 1409 DR , Nanfoodle aided in the plan when Bruenor abdicated the throne to continue his search for the legendary city of Gauntlgrym . He had extracted a poison from crystal flowers that would make it appear as if the drinker had died and the effect lasted for three days, as long as the mourning period. Nanfoodle was amongst his search party alongside Drizzt, Jessa Dribble-Obould , and Thibbledorf Pwent until his death.</p>
