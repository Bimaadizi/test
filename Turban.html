<p>Turbans were a form of headwear common in desert regions, such as Anauroch , Calimshan , and Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Turbans were composed of a long strip of fabric that one would wrap around their head. In Zakhara, middle-class men often wore their turbans wrapped around a skullcap , while those of upper classes typically wrapped theirs around fezzes . The former made a turban look like a flattened sphere. The latter made them appear taller, rounder, and overall more impressive. These wraps were often held in place by a pin or broach, the latter being particularly done by wearers of high stature. People in Calimshan also wrapped their turbans around skullcaps and secured them with ornate broaches, though they were also known to wear them atop keffiyehs .</p>
<p>The thick padding of turbans provided some degree of protection to a wearer's head.</p>
