<p>Circa 1486 DR , he acknowledged the threat of the Pudding King and was considering offering the help of his people to Dorbo Diggermattock in exchange for a formal recognition that they were citizens of Blingdenstone like the others. He also noted the strange behavior of the regular deep gnomes of Blingdenstone who'd been afflicted by the demon lord Juiblex 's madness, while the bestial wererats were not.</p>
