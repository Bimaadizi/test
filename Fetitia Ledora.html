<p>Fetitia Ledora was a half-elven incantatrix who founded the Sorority of the Silver Fire , alongside Yhelfanna the Masked , in her quest for revenge against the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point circa 975 DR , a terrifying dracolich threatened the destruction of Fetitia's home, the city of Everlund . This urged the woman to locate the origin of such an abomination, an adventure that took her all the way to Sembia , far to the southeast, where the Cult of the Dragon hid its temples.</p>
<p>Before she could fully put her plan into action, however, Fetitia found that she was not the only woman the Followers of the Scaly Way had upset; already, they were embroiled in a tense combat against Yhelfanna the Masked, a capable witch of Rashemen . Moving quickly to join her, the two became fast friends and, through their combined might, managed not only to foil a cell of Cultists but also end a pair of dracoliches that the Cult had hurriedly brought forth. Ultimately, the two women even destroyed a copy of the Tome of the Dragon that the Cult had been keeping there.</p>
<p>From there, in the Year of Bright Nights, 985 DR , Fetitia and Yhelfanna decided to maintain their joint efforts. This union would go on to be known as the Sorority of the Silver Fire, a group that, like their founders, dedicated itself to the pursuit and elimination of Sammaster 's corruptive Tome and his terrible dracoliches.</p>
