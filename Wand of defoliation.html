<p>A wand of defoliation was a magical wand .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike typical wands or staves , these were never made of wood. Bone or ivory were usually used to make the bases instead.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Such wands had two functions. With a single charge, they would destroy all chlorophyll within a 30 feet (9.1 meters) radius. All grass would become very dry and brown in color. If two charges were expended, trees and other plant life within the 30 feet (9.1 meters) range would instantly die. Sentient plant life would not automatically be killed, but would suffer moderate damage. The user of the wand could instead concentrate the power into a tight cone, causing extremely high damage to the plant creatures within. As such, these wands were deadly to shambling mounds and vegepygmies .</p>
