<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , Tojo declared his restaurant to be the best in Aru, but so did his brother and business rival Aki . To settle the question, they each might've offered a group of adventurers a free meal, one night after the other, so they could serve as impartial judges. However, Aki would pay a person to slip a mild purgative into their food when they dined at Tojo's, which would cause them gastrointestinal problems during their adventures.</p>
