<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The pirates used Jahaka Anchorage to store their plunder and hold their captive slaves. Their respective captains formed a tenuous alliance with Commander Liara Portyr of Fort Beluarian , granting a portion of their wealth along with safe passage for Baldurian ships in exchange for a blind eye to their operations.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>

<p>The anchorage's treasure trove was protected by ten flying swords .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
