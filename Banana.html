<p>A banana was a fruit that was grown on palm trees around Faerûn and Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The inner flesh of these yellow fruits was eaten, whilst the peel was usually regarded as waste.</p>
<h2>Cultivation</h2>
<p>The halflings of Luiren were known cultivators of bananas and grew bananas between Beluir and Chethel . They usually consumed them, but sometimes exported them to places such as Halruaa and Durpar , who were keen on green bananas. A few places in Chult , particularly the Agricultural Quarter of Mezro , contained banana plantations.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Bananas were consumed by many races such as humans and halflings , as well as other races and creatures around Toril , such as banana monkeys . The ashira , tree spirits of Zakhara , lived in banana trees (as well as trees bearing other fruits) and survived off of the bananas they produced.</p>
<p>The peel of these fruits was one of the material components required to cast Caddelyn's catastrophe .</p>
<p>Bananas were known to be fried for consumption, originating the saying "fried like a banana." Halflings from South Faerûn used bananas to flavor certain liqueurs and produced candied bananas to be shipped to their northern brethren.</p>
