The criminal dwarf traveled to meet Murssvayas, but was pursued by the Earthfast dwarves and also by both the Cult of the Crushing Wave and the Cult of the Black Earth . At last, Murssvayas met Furgis and/or his adventuring party bodyguards in the Underdark , but at that time earth cultists led by Yegor tried one last time to kill all present and take the codex, but they were defeated.</p>
<p>Later, after the fall of Szith Morcane, he was chosen by the archmage Solom Ned'razak as his representative to hire an adventuring party in Elventree to save the drow alchemist Xaven Tanor'this .</p>
<p>After the presumed death of Solom, Murssvayas became the leader of the drow resistance to the invading fire giants but his position was precarious.</p>
