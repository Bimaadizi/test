<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Rannath was a vale that ran from the northeast to the southwest across the Surague Escarpment northwest of Pyarados .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Matter from other planes had entered the zone in 952 DR , which made it a likely location for many abyssal creatures such as bodaks or bebiliths .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red Wizards of Thay slew Magister Baerzlus Anagathiir in that location after a long and extreme spellbattle in 952 DR , straining the Weave to its limit and in fact fraying it somewhat. Though Azuth repaired most of the damage, visits from beings from the Abyss became a normal feature of the zone well into 1370 DR .</p>
