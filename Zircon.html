<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zircon was volcanic in origin, found in igneous rock formations. It was a brownish crystal that turned pale blue when heated sufficiently and could be cut into faceted gemstones.

Zircons had an affinity for magic and could be enchanted easily, making them a favorite for use in creating magical items . A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
