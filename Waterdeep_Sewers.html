<p>The sewers of Waterdeep were a sanitation system of tunnels beneath the city that connected to most locations throughout Waterdeep , including its dungeons.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The depth of these sewers varied across Waterdeep, with some areas having around two to three sub-levels. One reason for this was Mount Waterdeep and the plateau the northern portion of the city was built upon. Another was that the varied sizes and areas in which the sewer network was constructed at were both deliberate design decisions, made in order to optimally account for the ocean tides.</p>
<p>The tunnels of this sewer system did not match up with the routes of the city's streets above them by the 14 th century DR . This was partially due to the ever changing layout of Waterdeep, but also because the sewer's layout was dictated in part by where Mount Waterdeep's springs rose and flowed down to the sea.</p>
<p>The Field Ward , the harbor islands, and the heart of Mount Waterdeep were the only areas in the city that the sewers did not run beneath.</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Refuse, as well as air, were brought down into the sewers by numerous feeder pipes scattered throughout the city. These pipes measured less than 1 foot (0.3 meters) in diameter. Thanks to the pipes, air supply was good in the sewers and those who traveled in them had little chance of suffocating.</p>
<p>The sewer network operated on a system of tidal flushing, meaning that its tunnels were filled with water by the ocean tides that came into Deepwater Harbor and were flushed out by those same tides. The sewer also received water from its upper levels by means of street runoff of rain and the frequent coastal fog, as well as spring water that was directed into cistern-caverns in Mount Waterdeep's upper reaches and then flowed down through pipes into the various wards. The sewer's tunnels emptied into the harbor at places that were covered by extremely large and strong gratings. These places were purposely difficult to access, as the sewer network's designers sought to hamper the movements of less desirable visitors from the sea and to prevent the sewers from being used by criminals as an underground highway.</p>
<p>Due to the great size of Waterdeep, there were concerns that the tidal flushing system could lead to the city's harbor becoming a cesspool. To ensure this didn't occur, Ahghairon and other mages bound spells into the city's wards and bound some elementals . In conjunction with the deliberate design decisions made for the sewer's size and layout, these assisted the flows of water in carrying away sewage.</p>
<p>Some of the more powerful spells that Ahghairon bound into the sewers involved mass teleporting waste straight to the Rat Hills . These spells continued to be renewed over the years by members of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors .</p>
<p>Some areas of the sewers featured doors that would close upon water entering from certain passages, which ensured that flooding did not occur. Other areas had pressure plates that would close doors once water stopped flowing over them, thus preventing backwash.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The ceilings, floors, and walls all throughout the sewer system were made of masonry, often times with paving bricks. There was little to no lighting within the sewers and a terrible stench pervaded the entire network.</p>
<p>Gratings in the sewers were all made of iron and were quite thick. Some were permanently set into the stone walls, while others could swing open on pivots. By the 14 th century DR, many of these grates were suffering from rust.</p>
<p>One of the two oldest parts of the sewers was a large semicircular channel, which ran around the inland side of the spur of Mount Waterdeep that jutted out into the Castle Ward . Waste from the North Ward and Sea Ward drained through this channel. The other oldest structure was two trunk sewers, which drained waste from the Trades Ward and Southern Ward . Both structures emptied out into Deepwater Harbor.</p>
<p>The passages of this sewer network had no names, thus directions tended to be given in terms of entry points and paces. Those who worked in the sewers were known to navigate passages by laying down boards as temporary bridges or by vaulting across ledges with 16 feet (4.9 meters) catchpoles. The latter of which were carried in order to reach below the water and clear debris from gratings.</p>
<p>Passages were denoted as being either one of two types based on their size, primary and secondary. Primary passages were easily navigable. They measured 20 feet (6.1 meters) across and had parallel, 3 feet (0.91 meters) wide, walkway ledges that lacked rails. Secondary passages were smaller, requiring human -sized creatures to crawl or swim their way through. They measured 12 feet (3.7 meters) and had a single 3 ft (0.91 m) wide ledge on one of their sides, usually the more easterly or southerly side.</p>
<p>Primary passages were far more common in the northern parts of the city's sewers, while secondary passages were prevalent in the areas beneath the Dock Ward.</p>
<p>Besides these two types there were many older, smaller passages that had over time been put out of service and walled up by the 14 th century DR. One of the oldest set of passages sat beneath Dock Ward and were known as the Smugglers' Run , since smugglers could navigate small boats through it.</p>
<p>Some areas of the sewers featured stone portals, a network built by an old dwarven kingdom to quickly move about. These required special enchanted stone items to activate, which took a variety of forms. These included daggers , gemstones , holy symbols , medallions, necklaces, orbs , rings , and scepters.</p>
<p>Some areas featured teleportation pads that were constructed by the sewer network's designers. These would teleport people to the surface, acting as an emergency exit for sewer workers in the case of flooding or other hazards. When broken, they would only teleport people elsewhere within the sewers.</p>
<p>The sewer network notably featured connections to the dungeon complex under Castle Waterdeep , the Dungeon of the Crypt , and in several places Undermountain . Many such links were kept operable and secret by the many guilds and shady organizations that operated in the city.</p>
<p>Connections with Undermountain in particular featured heavily in the city's tavern lore.</p>
<h3>Sewer Ecology</h3>
<p>There were a great deal of creatures that inhabited this sewer network, far more than could logically be expected to find enough food to survive. Many of these creatures entered the sewers by means of the Dungeon of the Crypt and Undermountain. There were also a wide variety of fungi and oozes that lived in the sewers, with there being a small chance of an ooze crawling its way up the privy pipes of the sewers.</p>
<p>Adventurers , wizards -for-hire, and mage guilds were regularly hired to go into the sewers to sweep and clear monsters out of areas. Such groups sometimes hired Cellarers to guide them through the sewers at the cost of 20 gold pieces a day, but such guides never carried weapons and would stick to only traveling the primary passages.</p>
<p>Explorers of the sewers risked exposure to sewer plagues . The waters were generally tainted with blinding sickness and any open wounds ran the risk of being contaminated with filth fever .</p>
<p>The creatures most commonly encountered within the sewer network around 1357 DR included: huge centipedes , a colony of green slime , a colony of yellow mold , mites , rats and giant rats , rot grubs , and scum creepers .</p>

<h3>Surface Shafts & Junction Rooms</h3>
<p>Some areas connected between primary passages, known as junction rooms , were square in shape. They measured 10 ft (3 m) by 10 feet (3 meters), were 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall, and had a sitting ledge near their ceiling.</p>
<p>Entrances into the sewer network were known as surface shafts . They measured 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter, were typically spherical in shape, and had iron rungs set in the walls for use as ladders . They were capped by covers made either wholly of metal or of metal-banded wood. These covers were known as "manholes" or "person access covers."</p>
<p>The surface shafts and junction rooms of this sewer network (as labeled on the map above) could be found at the following locations:</p>
<p>Entrances into the sewers that were not labeled on the map included the following locations:</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>These sewers were built over the course of many generations, dating as far back as 1162 DR . As far back as this date, there existed three levels to the sewer system.</p>
<p>During the days of Ahghairon, a number of Underdark creatures tried to invade the sewers and Waterdeep proper by means of a portal within Undermountain, which he put an end to by means of the gatewarp spell.</p>
<p>At some point a group of dwarves established a kingdom beneath the sewers, which eventually fell into ruin and became a mere legend on the surface. Their ruins were later discovered by the archeaologist Wently Kelso .</p>
<p>In 1208 DR , in the month of Kythorn , some unauthorized construction was discovered on the second level of the sewers.</p>
<p>After securing a stronghold in 1262 DR (that would later be renamed the Citadel of the Bloody Handy), the Shadow Thieves constructed for it two links to the sewers of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>In 1280 DR , in the month of Mirtul , some trapped sewer gas was cleared from an area on the third sewer level. A year later , on the month of Kythorn, a cistern area was added to the second level of the sewers. And in 1292 DR , on the month of Tarsakh , flood control gates on the second level were repaired and additional ones were installed.</p>
<p>In 1298 DR , the Shadow Thieves were driven out of the city and the Lords of Waterdeep had the citadel's two passages to the sewers garrisoned by the City Guard. From then on they were occasionally employed by high-ranking occupants of Castle Waterdeep when a discreet exit was desired.</p>
<p>Some time in the late 1350's DR, on Mirtul 15 , twelve tanystropheus eggs ordered by Phalantar's Philtres & Components hatched and escaped into the sewers via a garbage chute. That night a crew of Cellarers were attacked by the young dinosaurs while laying a large, heavy length of pipe. One member was killed, while two others were badly mauled. Frustrated by this, the guild offered a reward of 200 gold pieces for their capture (dead or alive), while Phalantar Orivan himself offered 500 gp for live specimens and 100 gp for dead ones. By the end of Uktar , it was assumed that any tanystropheuses not recovered were dead from the winter weather.</p>
<p>Around this decade, false and terribly inaccurate maps of the sewers were being sold by people trying to pass themselves off as Cellarers.</p>
<p>In 1355 DR , in the months of Ches and Tarsakh, flood control blocks were proposed for some areas of the upper sewer level.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR , a man from Luskan by the name of Neruudan set about making a smuggling ring in Waterdeep. To that end, he hired an evil mage to clear out the upper sewers. The mage put a giant crocodile in the sewers, with his quasit familiar riding upon its back and directing the beast, killing members of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild until they began to refuse to do work. However, Neruudan was unaware of the sewers' use as a highway by locals and their wide selection of dangerous fauna, which eventually lead to the downfall of his plans.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , during the Time of Troubles , the mortal avatar of Myrkul opened a portal between Hades and the Prime Material plane . Hoards of undead came rushing out through the sewers and up into the Dock Ward. The guardsman Ylarell tracked these undead and in the process was slain by Myrkul. Five Cellarers also became lost in the sewers during this time, having been transformed into cursts that continued to patrol the sewers for decades.</p>
<p>In the wake of Myrkul's destruction a deathshrieker was created in the sewers beneath what later became known as Cynosure . It would stalk the sewers for over a decade.</p>
<p>Also during this year, on Marpenoth 7 an adventuring band received orders from the Lords of Waterdeep to travel into the city's sewers to put an end to the ongoing plans of Xanathar . Before embarking into their depths the adventuring band was gifted by Khelben Arunsun with a partial map of the sewers and a copy of Wently Kelso's The World Beneath Waterdeep , which included several notes on the hazards and creatures they could expect to encounter. Secretly aided by another beholder, the adventurers managed to slay the crime lord and present his eye stalk to the Lords of Waterdeep, while the other beholder assumed the identity of Xanathar and took over his criminal organization.</p>
<p>In Eleint , 1367 DR , new creatures began to be encountered in the sewers by members of the Plumbers' Guild, such as sewerms. Some of these new creatures originated from the Rat Hills, such as gulguthydrae, having fled into the sewers following the Rat Hills Conflagration.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , during the event known as Halaster's Higharvestide , a number of creatures crawled out from the sewers and terrorized the people of Waterdeep. Following this event, the guard station located near the northern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand became primarily concerned with guarding against the living spells that still remained after Halaster's Higharvestide.</p>
<p>That same year the city faced an attack by the forces of Iakhovas . In the wake of that repelled invasion a number of sea creatures escaped into the sewer system, with some of them, like the malenti Laaqueel , having been led into the sewers through a surface shaft at Coin Alley by Iakhovas himself.</p>
<p>Among the dozens of aboleths that fought in the army of Iakhovas there was one trio, hailing from the Swordsea Depths , who had joined in this assault for the sole purpose of using the chaos to sneak their way into the city's sewer system. Within the sewers the would-be Savants of the Dark Tide established a lair, then over time gradually enslaved members of the Cellarers’ & Plumbers’ Guild and transformed rogues into skum servitors.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR, the doomsphere Xliiqil began stalking the sewers, trying to learn what happened to the Company of Crazed Venturers who had slayed it decades prior. Also around this time, eyeballs and lurking stranglers roamed the sewers on behalf of Xanathar. After the event known as the Silence of Lolth began in Eleasis 28 , some drow fled into the depths of the Lowerdark and displaced the rylkar, a rat-like species to known to only a few Underdark experts. Moving to higher subterannean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers in Faerûn, including the Sewers of Waterdeep.</p>
<p>In 1385 DR , the Spellplague hit Toril and caused all of the Walking Statues of Waterdeep to become animated and wreak havoc across the city. The Blackstaff at the time, Tsarra Chaadren , turned the ground to mud underneath a statue known as the God Catcher . It sank partway into the ground, one of its legs penetrating a sewer line. Once the statues became immobile the God Catcher remained where it had sunken and was eventually converted into a tenement building, while its leg was hollowed out to create an access point to the sewer system.</p>
<p>Around In the late 15 th century DR, a number of dwarves attempting to dig larger homes for themselves in Undercliff inadvertently breach Waterdeep's sewers in the process.</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , shortly after Mistshore was largely destroyed in a massive fire, Xanathar had some areas of the sewer network diverted in order to give his organization more space, which resulted in a large daily influx of sewage into Deepwater Harbor. Merfolk who lived nearby made attempts to clean the area, but were slaughtered by an undead eye of the deep under Xanathar's command. Eventually, Laeral Silverhand intervened — the meddlings of Xanathar were undone, the eye of the deep was slain, and harbor waters were revitalized.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , Jeryth Phaulkon sent awakened rats into the sewers to search for Xanathar's hidden lair, eventually discovering a secret spiral stairwell in the sewers beneath the Castle Ward .</p>
