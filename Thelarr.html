<p>A thelarr was a simple wind instrument cut from a reed. It was considered a rustic longhorn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thelarrs made a characteristic buzzing sound due to the dry fibers inside them. They were very simple instruments to construct, so that skilled bards made them to give away to children.</p>
<p>If purchased through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue , they could be obtained individually or as complete sets that could be played together to form melodies and chords.</p>
