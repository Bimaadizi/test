<p>The Citadel of the Mists was a castle located in the north-east area of the High Forest .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Citadel of the Mists was located in a secluded part of the northern edge of the High Forest. It was built on top of an ancient elven armory, which was connected to the Trail of Mists .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Citadel comprised two buildings that enclosed a narrow triangular courtyard. Its most striking feature was a set of three towers of different heights. Invisible dimension door portals were dotted throughout the Citadel and could transport unsuspecting visitors to other parts of the structure.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Citadel was cloaked by an ancient wardmist spell that made it almost inaccessible. The Mistmaster had modified this spell to be triggered automatically when specific conditions were present, similar to a magic mouth spell. He also could use his powers to cloak the entire citadel at will. The Mistmaster had given a ward token to each of his allies, which stopped the wardmist from triggering on them. As well as mists, the Citadel was protected by illusion magic. The armory below the Citadel was protected by warding spells.</p>
<p>The Citadel's tallest tower was protected by fire elementals and air elementals that had been magically charmed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The elven fortress on the ruins of which the Citadel would be built was constructed around −4500 DR by cambions from House Dlardrageth to serve as an armory of magic items from Aryvandaar . Bound demons were also used to guard the treasure. It was discovered and plundered by Siluvanedenn forces, and abandoned around −4300 DR . Eaerlann discovered it again after their annexation of Siluvanede, and sent archmages to create magical wards in order to protectively seal away the armory.</p>
<p>Around −3150 DR , Eaerlanni elves chose upper chambers of the armory as a way station for gnomes fleeing Netherese slavery through the recently created Trail of Mists. The gnomish use of the armory continued to around −1700 DR , when demons escaped their binding spells and seized the upper chambers. A group of adventurers comprising forest gnomes and moon elves protected the armory with additional wards to prevent the demons from escaping the armory altogether.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR , the Mistmaster had the Citadel built on top of the warded ruins of the elven armory. In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Mistmaster allied his forces with Turlang and a force of fey to protect the Citadel from an attacking alliance of demons and the Blue Bear tribe .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There were many rumors about treasure in the vaults beneath the citadel, left over from its original purpose as a storehouse of magic items for House Dlardrageth.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the lord of the Citadel was the Mistmaster , a mysterious and powerful illusionist and cleric of Leira . His consort was a halfling evoker named Azure . Iltmul the monk also resided there and in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR held the position of Green Master of Dragons. He had previously been the White Master of Dragons before the title was taken from him in a fight by Dumal Erard . The Mistmaster allowed Cherissa Mintareil and other powerful adventurers to stay there. He also employed a small group of staff for the Citadel.</p>
<p>The Citadel was also home to pegasi , which were trained at the whims of the Mistmaster. It was protected by charmed fire elementals and air elementals.</p>
