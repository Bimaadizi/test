<p>Jassal was an expensive perfume with peculiar properties found in the Realms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jassal appeared as a translucent blue-green alcohol . It exuded the smell of ripe cherries , and when applied briefly chilled the skin (from alcohol evaporation) before turning clear and imparting a subtle, wafting cherry scent to the wearer for about six hours.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>In addition to its use as a pleasant perfume, jassal found an appreciation with the church of Loviatar , who came to use it in many rituals. They discovered that if someone was drenched in jassal and then lashed with a whip , it would create an intense burning sensation across the body and heal all minor wounds, scratches, and bruises on their person. It would also produce a loud cracking sound on impact, and exuded a strong burst of cherry scent even if the perfume had already faded to almost nothing.</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>The recipe for jassal was believed to involve alcohol, cherries, and more secret ingredients, but it actually consisted of alcohol and the distilled roots of thistles , nettles , and three flowering weeds.</p>
