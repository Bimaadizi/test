<p>The man owed an impressive sum to Traevyn Illance .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Elminster Aumar , a fugitive mage, Lord Helderstone had spent a score, or twenty, years living as a recluse in Sembia. He had also died recently as of late Mirtul in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . Per the more precise Traevyn Illance, Rauligus Helderstone had spent twenty-nine summers in Sembia . Before his parting, Lord Illance had loaned him 700,000 golden lions , with a clause that on the year-day, 10,000 more would be owed. The sum was to be repaid in full upon return to Suzail .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>An impersonator, Mirt the moneylender , was caught in Suzail during late Mirtul, by armsmen under the mages Scarmar Heldeth and Morligul Downdagger , themselves working for Traevyn Illance. The latter, rather than believe it was an impersonator, believed some threat had arisen out of Sembia and frightened the man.</p>
<p>Despite his extensive plans on what to do to punish the man, they could not come to fruition, as Mirt was rescued and Traevyn knocked out.</p>
