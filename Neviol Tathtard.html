<p>Neviol Tathtard was a human furniture maker in Silverymoon , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . He was also the leader of Tathtard's Rose , a syndicate of merchants across Luruar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Neviol was greedy and ruthless, but extremely intelligent, cautious, patient, and subtle.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tathtard's Rose was a secret organization that grew under Neviol's leadership. He worked to create opportunities for the members to make great profits, but not so great that they drew attention from the authorities. His tools were price fixing, cronyism, market manipulation, artificial shortages of goods, and leveraging insider information.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Neviol guided things such that all members saw increased profits, but only in long-term schemes. He did not want the temptation of a huge short-term gain to cause any member to betray the others. However, he did not follow his own guidance. Neviol once eliminated a rival member by ordering his most trusted agents to poison the entire household, including the servants, and loot all the cash, gems , and trade bars before anyone discovered the crime. Neviol planned to mete out the same fate to the other members when their fortunes had grown enough to make it worth the risk.</p>
