<p>A wyrmtongue scepter was an enchanted scepter from Cormanthor with a variety of powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The silver rod was fluted and chased, with one end tapering into a stylized flame, and the other end topped with a fist-sized sapphire . A slender, realistically depicted dragon was carved into a curling form around the scepter's body, with two eyes made of emerald and amber . At the tip of its tail, it curled around an alestone .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>By touching the emerald eye at the same time as the sapphire, the scepter launched a ray of white light that dealt grievous damage to undead , and to undead only. The ray traveled for 90 feet (27 meters) and hung in the air for a minute; it was possible to direct it during this time, effectively using it to attack.</p>
<p>Touching the amber and the sapphire, the scepter fired off a different straight beam of light. Up to three of them could be fired off within a minute; those dealt electric damage when they struck.</p>
<p>Touching the alestone and the sapphire, the scepter launched a backlash field . This power was available only twice daily.</p>
<p>The scepter could also be willed to float in place, staying there indefinitely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several dozen such scepters were made in Cormanthor , wielded by Elven high mages of the realm and their agents, often to deal with renegade wizards.</p>
<p>In 241 DR , Elminster purchased a wyrmtongue scepter from Surgath Ilder , a prospector who was experimenting with the device after retrieving it from an elven tomb.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>As of 1367 DR , one such scepter was said to be hidden within the Royal Palace of Suzail .</p>
