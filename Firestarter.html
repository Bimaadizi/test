<p>Firestarters were useful items that could be found in arid Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A firestarter was a small cylindrical mechanical device used to create fire. They were approximately 4 inches (10 centimeters) long and weighed 1 pound (450 grams). A full firestarter held a few ounces of volatile liquid star oil that could be used up to a hundred times before needing to be refilled.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The liquid star oil was ignited by a flint mechanism held within the firestarter. This item was particularly useful in the dry Land of Fate where kindling was often hard to find. Tabacco smokers also used them to light their water pipes . These items were relatively common throughout the Free Cities of Zakhara and Muluk but were rarely seen elsewhere in Zakhara.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first firestarter was invented during the 1360s DR by a team of clever sages at the university in Qadib . A simple firestarter usually sold for 100–400 gp in Qadib, but that price would increase drastically based upon the decoration and kind of material used during its construction and the firestarter's proximity to Qadib.</p>
