<p>A navigation orb was a massive, spherical device used by cloud giants to navigate their flying castles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An orb was constructed as a sphere of burnished mithral , 7‑foot (2.1‑meter) in diameter, inscribed with the skye rune in the giant language . It would remain aloft in the air, floating about 10 feet (3 meters) above ground level.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each navigation orb was linked to a specific cloud giant castle. When kept within a castle, an individual could discern its orientation to the ground below and change its altitude or direction in which it traveled.</p>
<p>If an orb was removed from within or somehow destroyed, the cloud giant castle to which it was linked would remain stuck in a fixed location.</p>
