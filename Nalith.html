<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nalith was a guest at Havilyn 's party in the Year of the Black Flame, 229 DR , where the Magelord Neldryn Hawklyn , displeased with Nalith's impatience, made a display of casting an illusion on his dinner showing him the head of the last man to try and steal from his warehouse. Neldryn used the Crystal Chain of Binding shortly afterwards to try and capture Magister Dorgon Heamiiolothtar , which pretty much brought the party down.</p>
