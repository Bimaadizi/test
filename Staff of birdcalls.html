<p>A staff of birdcalls was a magical staff that was able to mimic the calls of various birds .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff was distinguished from other staves by the carvings of birds that covered it. The bird-calls created by the staff could be heard for a distance up to 60 feet (18 meters). The wielder was able to choose which bird call to mimic. The birds the staff could mimic were a chicken , crow , duck , eagle , finch , goose , loon, owl , turkey , or seagull . The staff held ten charges, and these charges were recharged daily at dawn. When the last charge was used, there was a chance the staff could erupt into a cloud of feathers.</p>
