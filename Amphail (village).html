<p>Amphail was a village on the Long Road between Waterdeep and Red Larch .</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>It had a population of 600, supporting 250 more in outlying farms. The population was mostly humans , but there were a few half-elves , dwarves , halflings , and other races.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amphail was named after one of Waterdeep's early warlords, Amphail the Just , who had estates here.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village was three days' ride north of Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Its main trade was growing food for Waterdeep, but it was also known for its outstanding horses —including Amphail grays , glossy black chargers, and Amphail fancys . Due to this, the village suffered from the stench of horse manure during the warmer months.</p>
<p>The wealthier inhabitants or landowners of Amphail were generally the ones who bred horses. The largest horse breeder was the Roaringhorn family of Waterdeep, but others included Amcathra , Ilzimmer , Jhansczil , and Tarm , as well as individual breeders Rorth Baldasker , Ohm Oglyntyr , and Elraghona Selember . Although not breeders, the Eagleshield family made tack for the horses and operated a farm for the treatment of sick animals.</p>
<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>The village had no standing militia of its own, but benefited from Waterdhavian guards who patrolled from Rassalantar .</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>The spirit of Amphail the Just, called the "Ghost of Amphail," was said to patrol the streets.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The village was led by Lord Warder Briiathor Alougarr , a muscular Tethyrian loyal to Piergeiron the Paladinson . Also notable were the 8-ft-tall (244 cm) Dlara , a Chultan wrestler; Mother Gothal who ran Mother Gothal's , a festhall; and Krivvin Shamblestar , the proprietor of the Stag-Horned Flagon .</p>
