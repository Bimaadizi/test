<p>Vin Valle was a painter of some social standing from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lady Jannath was one of the patrons of Vin's. She purchased at least one painting from the artist â€“ the piece titled Reflections on Umberlee . Some time later the same year, they were invited to attend the art show titled "Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast," hosted by Lady Jannath in her Lower City estate. Reflections on Umberlee was one of the paintings on display and the hostess asked her butler, Tarhun Mnemonis , to remind the artist of that upon arrival.</p>
