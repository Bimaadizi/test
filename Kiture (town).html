<p>Kiture ( pronounced : /ˈ k ɑː ɪ t ɜːr eɪ / KAI-tur-ay ) was one of the nine towns of the sahuagin kingdom of Kurrimal and its predecessor Aleaxtis .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This town was located within the Alamber Sea , at the top edge of the Pythan Trench . Out of Kurrimal's nine towns, it was the closest to the Sharksbane Wall and Serôs .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Like all nine of the towns of Kurrimal, this town was governed by a prince of the same name, Kiture .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kiture was founded circa 420 TS (350 DR) , though under a different name. In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , when the kingdom of Kurrimal was founded as the successor of Aleaxtis, this town's name was changed to that of the prince put in charge of governing it.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Compared to other towns, Kiture had an unusually high rate of malenti births. Most malenti spawned in this town were quickly put to death, while some managed to survive to become priestesses of Sekolah , spies, or warriors . However, due to Kitture's brutal elimination of malenti newborns, it was not uncommon for malenti in any three of these groups to go rogue and take up life in Serôs.</p>
