<p>Spirit was a term used for a variety of distinct but related concepts, creatures and types of being.</p>
<h2>Spirits of the Living and the Dead</h2>
<p>In everyday language, "having spirit" meant possessing a lively temperament.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the spirit was the animating lifeforce of a being, often equated with the soul .</p>
<p>If the body of an inhabitant of the Realms died, their spirit usually moved on to become a petitioner of their respective deity, or, in the case of unbelievers, one of the False or the Faithless . Sometimes a curse , the tragic importance of some unfinished business, a will of extreme evil or good , or necromantic magic interfered with this course of events, causing the spirit to remain on Toril and become an undead creature.</p>
<p>In Mulhorand , the Church of Osiris believed that people had two spirits within their bodies, known as ba and ka . The former was said to remain in a mortal's body when it died, while the latter moved on to be judged by Osiris .</p>
<h2>Nature Spirits</h2>
<p>The environment was populated with a near-infinite variety of creatures and forces with a close connection to nature, also often collectively called spirits. Among these were counted the races of the dryads and nymphs . Nature spirits , also called primal spirits , were considered to be the most powerful and reclusive of spirits that shamans , druids , and barbarians could contact.</p>
<p>The Nine Trickster Gods of Omu were also considered primal spirits in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<p>The land of Rashemen was also host to a great deal of nature spirits, such as the telthor , thomil , uthraki , and strongest of all the wood man .</p>
<p>Next to the spirit of each physical part of nature, green elves revered a number of god -like wilderness spirits, most important among them Bear , Coyote , Eagle , Raven , Snake , and Wolf .</p>
<h2>Spirits of Kara-Tur</h2>
<p>On the continent of Kara-Tur spirits called kami , or sometimes nature gods, represented all aspects of nature and the elements as well as personifying places. They (together with other beings like oriental dragons ) were organized in a great hierarchy called the Celestial Bureaucracy . Consequently, the plane paralleling the lands of Kara-Tur they resided in was named the Spirit World , and the language of the Celestial Court was also called the Spirit Tongue .</p>
<p>Related were several races that sprang from the union of spirits and humans, like hengeyokai and spirit folk .</p>
<p>The eastern continent also had its share of undead spirits: They were condemned to their status by the Lords of Karma . They were shut up in the Underworld during the day, and terrorized the lands of the living by night. Among them were counted the bajang , bisan , gaki , chu-u , con-tinh , and kuei .</p>
<p>Despite the name, spirit creatures were not necessarily incorporeal; many had flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Kara-Tur's Bavanese people had their own fluid system of describing spirits based on supernatural encounters. This system was comprised of five distinct categories â€“ danjang , demit , lelembut , memedi , and tujul .</p>
