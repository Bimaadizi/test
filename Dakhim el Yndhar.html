<p>Dakhim el Yndhar was a former caleph arcane of Almraiven .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While one of the most powerful wizards alive in Calimshan in 1370 DR , the elderly wizard chose to live as a hermit in one of the minarets in northern Memnon . From his simple-looking tower, he spent his time making specialty magic carpets and other magic item variants. While the syl-pasha tried to bribe him to move to Calimport and provide his services at court, the old enchanter despised politics.</p>
