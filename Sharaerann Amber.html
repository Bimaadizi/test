<p>Sharaerann Amber was a kind of fortified wine or sherry extant in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This fortified wine was the color of amber. Alustriel Silverhand preferred it room temperature, and it generally was produced for immediate consumption; however, the wine from South Faerûn became more amber if aged three years or more, and was stronger than the varieties bottled in the north.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sharaerann Amber originated from the rural areas of Durpar and, before the Spellplague ravaged the Shining South , from across the entire nation of Var the Golden , where the wine was boasted as the "best Sharaerann." In the 15 th century DR, the Durpari Sharaerann Amber was bottled and exported out of Vaelan . It was a blended fortified wine aged in large casks and poured in smaller kegs for transportation and sale. During that time, Sharaerann Amber was imported to Amn , Tethyr , Baldur's Gate , Waterdeep , and visually any caravan or port city across Faerûn .</p>
