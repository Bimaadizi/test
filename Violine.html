<p>Violine gems were purple and volcanic in nature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Found in deposits mixed with other minerals and occasionally of exceptional (up to human fist) size, this ornamental stone was usually cut cabochon and polished, or faceted baguette style. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<p>Violine stones were considered sacred by followers of Ghaunadaur â€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This gem was proof against mummy rot . A creature with mummy rot only had to touch a violine crystal and the mummy rot was removed. The violine was completely consumed by this process. If this stone came into contact with an actual mummy , it burst and damaged the mummy. If a mummy was destroyed by contact with violine, the resulting mummy dust was inert and could not be used as a spell component or for other magical purposes.</p>
