<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cuamogh's tribe was the sworn enemy of the neighboring Batiru Stone Knives tribe . At some point in or before Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Stone Knives stole Shattered Spear's namesake revered heirloom, and in retaliation, the Spears drove the Knives out of their home in the jungles of the Samarlogh . In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a group of adventurers allied with a merchant from Samargol became involved in the Batiri conflict. Cuamogh was in possession of a priceless flawless gem that a merchant from Samargol desired, and the Batiri knew its value. She offered the gem in exchange for retrieval of her tribe's heirloom - the broken spear , hidden away in an abandoned yuan-ti temple.</p>
<p>Cuamogh's fate and the outcome of the Bariri hostilities remained unrecorded, but it was known that by way of the artifact's retrieval or through slaughter, the adventures were able to retrieve Shattered Spear tribe's flawless gem of the tiefling merchant Vadin'ya .</p>
