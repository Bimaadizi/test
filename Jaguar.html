<p>Jaguars were large, jungle-dwelling felines .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jaguars were similar in size and appearance to leopards, but were somewhat bulkier and had spotted rosettes. They had golden fur and black spots, but a rare few had black fur and black spots, and were called black jaguars.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Jaguars were ferocious predators, and greatly feared by any humanoid who lived in their territory. They were aggressive and attacked any creature they saw as a potential threat. They stealthily stalked prey, usually from above in the tree cover. Their sharp claws delivered devastating wounds. A jaguar was capable of jumping a distance of up to 30 ft (9.1 m).</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Jaguars lived solitary lives and were primarily tree-dwelling, spending most of their time above ground.</p>
<h3>Diets</h3>
<p>Jaguars were obligate carnivores. Despite spending a significant part of their day in the tree tops, jaguars were excellent swimmers. Being solitary creatures, jaguars only mingled with others of their species for mating. A female jaguar had a litter of up to three cubs.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Jaguars were typically found in jungles and were very territorial. In the Shining South , they were known to inhabit the Ajmer Forest and Forest of Amtar .</p>
<p>Beyond Faerûn , jaguars were found throughout Maztica and in the jungles of Zakhara . In east Zakhara , they could be found in the Grey Jungle .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Jaguars had a significant place in Maztica, even having a month named after them in the Maztican calendar. They were the namesake of the Jaguar Knights of Maztica, and a holy symbol of the god of war, Zaltec .</p>
<p>Jaguar claws were a token of hishnashapers and used as a material component in certain hishna spells. Mazticans used tough strands extracted from jaguar guts to craft snares to capture parrots and other birds used for pluma magic.</p>
<p>Wild halfling villages in the jungles of Far Payit kept jaguars, using them to kill any prisoners.</p>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold jaguar hides for 25 gp a piece.</p>
