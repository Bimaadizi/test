<p>Christopher was a trusted champion of High King Cymrych Hugh.

Meanwhile, the newly crowned High King moved his seat to Caer Callidyrr .</p>
<p>When High King Cymrych ultimately succumbed to his injuries in the Year of the Storm Crown, 250 DR , he was succeeded by his thirteen year old son, Warren , who established the Cymrych Dynasty of Callidyrr . With such a weak heir to the throne of High King, the lords of the Ffolk began to squabble amongst each other.
