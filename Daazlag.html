<p>Daazlag was an orog in the Thar in the early 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1369 DR , Daazlag, alongside his siblings Naazlog and his leader Thrull , emerged from the Underdark to the Xûl-Jarak citadel in Thar . There, the orc adept Jurrg proclaimed them "sons of Gruumsh " and Thrull the new king of Thar. Quickly, Thrull ordered Naazlog and Daazlag to act as his lieutenants.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, Rûlgar , Jurrg's brother, found the Hammer of Gruumsh in a cave in the Galena Mountains and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near.</p>
<p>Meanwile, Daazlag had secretly formed an alliance with Bremen Leiyraghon , heir of House Leiyraghon in Melvaunt , and thanks to his ally the orogs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses of Melvaunt . Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.</p>
<p>Daazlag survived the raid of an adventuring party hired by Lord Woarsten Nanther , which had defeated Thrull inside Xûl-Jarak and rescued the scions. Together with his ally Bremen, he planned vengeance and during a party hosted by House Leiyraghon to celebrate the heroes, Daazlag and some orc archers attacked the guests.</p>
