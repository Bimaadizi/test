<p>Elupar was a small fishing village in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay on the eastern shore of the Deepwash at the foot of the Cloven Mountains . It was the closest settlement to the settlement of Lachom .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, Elupar did not have an official leader nor government, only an loose band of fisherman, though they did employ a sheriff to keep the peace. However, the position often remained empty as the village was a sleepy little place and offered little excitement.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Being nearby the lizardfolk city of Surkh , the good folk of Elupar were afraid of their scaly neighbors. Even though this wariness was irrational and fueled by nothing but stories, Elupar stayed out of Surkh's business.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Like other city-states of the Vilhon Reach, Elupar celebrated the festival of the Rotting Dance with a wild, joyful celebration. The festival celebrated the city-states' independence from Chondath . Even though the exact date of the liberation was unknown, the Rotting Dance took place every year on Higharvestide .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Elupar did not have a militia.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>From 900 DR through 902 DR , the Chondathan civil war later named the Rotting War consumed the nation. The grand finale of the conflict was the creation of a magical and extremely deadly plague that decimated Chondathan armies. The survivors took the plague home, spreading death. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar 's loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from Iljak , declared independence, becoming city-states. Even though Elupar was just a small fishing village at the time, it gained independence nevertheless.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Howling Hourglass, 1184 DR , a thief stole a holy spellbook of Mielikki — Yornar's Trail Companion —from the ranger Rhighaermon O'Antlers and sold it to Lord Lathamp of Elupar. Rhighaermon, along with a half-dozen devotees of the Forest Queen, raided Lathamp's palace to steal it back. The book was seized from the vaults amidst a fierce battle against the noble's Eluphan guards.</p>
