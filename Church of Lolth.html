<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Priestesses would honor the Spider Queen by conducting rituals, leading sacrifices and spreading the faith. Sacrifices of surface elves would occur monthly, usually during a full moon as a direct insult to the elven deity Sehanine Moonbow .</p>
<p>Other rituals included summoning yochlol to gather information or aid.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The church was heavily dominated by female drows, as only females could become priestesses in their society. They were also seen as social leaders, rulers, and highly ranked members of drow society and due to their authority, could punish those whom they wished in her name. Drow matriarchs would often work alongside the church to gain power and influence.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
