<p>The Three Sisters were a series of volcanoes in the Ice Spires South .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Three Sisters were semi-active volcanoes. They were connected to a complex of lava and steam vests leading deep into the depths of Toril . (These same steam vents connected to the Dour Fissure , a deep gorge farther to the north. ) So much heat was in the ground of the foothills of the Three Sisters that the small dale adjacent to the hills was on average 25Â° warmer than the surrounding valley. This increased temperature allowed for limited agriculture, which provided much of the food for the kingdom of Hartsvale .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Three Sisters were considered a part of the Firecap Mountains , which were themselves a part of the Ice Spires .</p>
