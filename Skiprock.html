<p>Skiprocks were specially made, polished stone projectiles invented by halfling weaponsmiths and prized by members of that race.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Skiprocks were finely weighted and shaped to ensure they were perfect for throwing. If thrown well enough, after hitting a target they would typically ricochet and hit another.</p>
<p>Besides their use as pure projectiles, skiprocks were known to be used as bullets for slings or the heavy warsling . However, when shot from a sling they typically did not ricochet.</p>
<h2>Notable Users of Slingrocks</h2>
<p>Skiprocks were primarily wielded by halflings, especially lightfoots . They were also a standard weapon in the arsenal of any warsling sniper .</p>
