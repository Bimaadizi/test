<p>The Citadel Gate was the city gate of Baldur's Gate that separated Watch Citadel and its surrounding district from the rest of the Upper City .</p>
<p>This gate was only way in and out of the district, used by the Watch to launch mounted patrols from their fortress in the late 1400s DR . These horses were the only ones allowed in the city, and their excursions were largely ceremonial in nature.</p>
