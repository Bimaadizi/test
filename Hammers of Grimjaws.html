<p>The Hammers of Grimjaws are the highest ranking and most elite order of paladins who dedicate their lives and services to Tyr .</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Members of the Grimjaws are sponsored by existing members from the ranks of only two orders of Tyr, the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword .</p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>The choosing of the Hammers' members is in part done by Tyr himself, in order to ascend the order's ranks, a candidate must pray and receive a vision from Tyr. A vision of Tyr's warhammer shows the god's favor and permits immediate acceptance into the order. A vision of Tyr's sword means that the aspiring Hammer has failed in some way and must atone before entering the ranks. A successful atonement quest allows the aspirant to join the Order as though he had seen the vision of the warhammer. Currently there are less than 12 Hammers in active service, a testament to the purity and power required to become one of the order.</p>
