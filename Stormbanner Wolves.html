<p>The Stormbanner Wolves were the fearsome Northlander defenders and raiders of Rogarsheim on Norland .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These forces were concerned with defending their realm from the threat of giants from the south of Norland , which they did alongside the other inhabitants of the island including the Ffolk . They also focused much of their energies on attacking Amn 's colonies in the Moonshaes, especially by sinking the Amnian merchant vessels that traveled the Sea of Swords between the Sword Coast and Snowdown .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR , the forces of Rogarsheim comprised a fleet of six longships (the largest on Norland), each crewed by forty battle-ready sailors. This fleet boasted two ships crewed by elite fighters (twice as many as the other kingdoms of Norland), and one of these crews had been handpicked by the king to be the most skilled combatants on the whole of Norland.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, despite a century of peace with the Ffolk under the United Moonshae Isles , the Stormbanner Wolves retained a warlike tradition that kept them culturally distinct and continually suspicious of their neighbors around the Moonshae Isles, especially Alaron .</p>
