<p>The Moonlight Men were a mercenary company famous for saving the cities of Silverymoon and Everlund .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Moonlight Men were a mercenary company for only eight years, but during that brief time, they gained a great reputation. They usually guarded caravan roads around Sundabar , Silverymoon, and Everlund.</p>
<p>Their last battle was the defense of Turnstone Pass against a huge orc horde . They managed to crush the orcs, but only six Moonlight Men, include Mintiper Moonsilver , survived. Mintiper went to wander south, while the others possibly joined the army of Silverymoon.</p>
<p>The bodies of the fallen mercenaries were interred in the Cairn of Moonlight within the Pass.</p>
