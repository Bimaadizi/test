<p>Belts of Valindra's guard were enchanted belts that were created to be boons for Valindra Shadowmantle 's most powerful minions in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearers of these belts received boosts to their vitality, accuracy, intelligence, charisma, and ability to land lucky devastating strikes. When an amulet of Valindra's favor was worn together with a belt of Valindra's guard and a shard of Valindra's crown , the belt greatly fortified the wearer's resistance to enthralling and controlling spells and, in turn, strengthened the wearer's own such spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These belts were given out to the most powerful of Valindra Shadowmantle's minions as a sign of favor. After Valindra's defeat at the hands of the defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR, some of these belts were recovered from the villains' bodies.</p>
