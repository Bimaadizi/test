<p>Offalmound , sometimes named interchangeably with the name of its Abyssal layerâ€“ Rarandreth , was the 223 rd layer of the Abyss , and the domain of an ancient Netherese deity of rot and decay called Moander .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many scholars argued that after the perceived death of its ancient master Moander in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the layer ceased to exist. Another school of thought on the matter was that along with the deity's body, their realm was ejected beyond the Astral Plane , where it floated adrift. These theories seem to have been false or Moander's demise was not as complete as many thought. As of the late-14 th century DR , Offalmound remained a layer of the Abyss, with its lordship contested. The layer remained contested following the Spellplague , but as Moander was fully restored as a power of Lower Planes , the fate of his putrid Offalmound remained unclear.</p>
