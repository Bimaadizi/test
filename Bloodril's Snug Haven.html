<p>Bloodril's Snug Haven was an inn located in the town of Bryn Shander during the 14 th century DR . It was one of the oldest establishments within the town's walls.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Like many of Bryn Shander's inns, the Snug Haven was poorly constructed. It stood high above ground level, which offered little protection from icy winds and freezing temperatures.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The poor construction of the ironically named Snug Haven left guests of the inn cold and shivering.</p>
