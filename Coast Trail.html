<p>The Coast Trail was a alternative to the Trade Way as a means to travel from Calimport to Memnon , avoiding the Calim Desert .</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the trail followed the windy coast along the southern and western edges of Calimshan . The path was only wide enough for a single cart and covered rocky terrain, but it was far enough from the effects of Memnon's Crackle . The trail was primarily used by adventurers or other vagabonds. Many hermits, smugglers, or other folk who wished to live undetected built structures a mile or so off the path.</p>
<p>Besides Calimport and Memnon, the town of Teshburl lies along the trail, as does the House of St. Liwan's Blessing , a monastery to Ilmater .</p>
