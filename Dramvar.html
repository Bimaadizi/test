<p>Dramvar was an eladrin noble and the Master of the Spire of Summer's Mist on the Watch on Forever's Edge , together with Eloar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had platinum-colored hair, bound-up in a knot, and a pale visage.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dramvar was quite pleasant and gregarious, though he still wasn't used to humans displaying certain levels of skill.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was fond of Taal .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Dramvar carried an enchanted , glimmering bow of silvery wood. Though it was unstrung, it created a thread of light to use as string when held. During his visit to the Spire of Winter's Peace , he was wearing platinum-colored clothes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At a point in time equivalent to the Year of the Secret, 1396 DR , Dramvar joined Eloar in a trip to their neighboring spire, the Tower of Winter's Peace , where they sought to talk to Malyanna . Her castellan, Taal , informed them that her absence continued and that she was in the world rather than the Feywild ; they invoked the Articles of the Compact , requesting Taal provide access to her chambers, so that they may be examined for suspicious activity. Though Taal acquiesced, he ambushed and slew them shortly afterwards. He discarded their bodies over Forever's Edge later.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Taal replicated Dramvar's handwriting later, claiming that the two eladrin nobles he'd slain had decided to remain at Winter's Peace for a full tenday.</p>
