<p>The Crescent Moon was a fortune teller shop and residence of the gypsy Kisandra in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Crescent Moon was a rather old, one-story building divided into eighteen rooms. It was made of stucco , had a flat stone roof, and lacked any windows in the rooms where business was conducted.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The parlor where business was primarily conducted was covered in a thick carpet and sparsely furnished, having only a few chairs and a table where candles and cards would be placed. In the adjoining rooms where other services were offered, the carpets were of a finer quality, the chairs were more comfortable, and the tables were larger. The one for fortune-telling had a crystal ball , whilst the one used for seances was engraved with a silver pentacle. The rest of the building was taken up by a kitchen, sleeping quarters, and storage rooms.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Kisandra primarily offered non- magical fortune-telling through the reading of cards or palms for the price of a few copper pieces . These fortunes were neither quite precise nor wildly inaccurate. She also offered to contact the spirits of the deceased and perform "genuine divination " for more wealthy clientele, though in actuality for both services Kisandra merely used a medallion of ESP and spells from the illusion school of magic to trick her clients. Though her methods were chicanery, genuine knowledge of folklore, legends, and the undead could be gleaned from her services.</p>
<p>Besides fortune-telling, the Crescent Moon provided temporary housing for wandering gypsies, though it did not openly advertise this service.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Besides Kisandra herself, the Crescent Moon was home to her grandchildren Jacko and Lucinda . The latter would read fortunes for clients whenever Kisandra was taking a break and otherwise would use her attractive looks to distract Kisandra's more cynical clients.</p>
