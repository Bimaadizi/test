<p>Telescopes of true vision were incredibly useful enchanted spyglasses that originated in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spyglasses were cylindrical and often made of precious metal such as gold .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A telescope of true vision provided the mundane ability of magnifying a viewed object by a factor of 50. Thus a ship at sea from 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) away would appear to be 100 feet away when viewed through the spyglass.</p>
<p>The enchantment upon these spyglasses pierced illusions and other magical misdirection, allowing the viewer to see an object in its true form.</p>
<p>A telescope of true vision had 20 charges. Upon using the last charge the lens would crack and the item would be ruined.</p>
