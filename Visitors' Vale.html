<p>Visitors' Vale was a valley on the island of Suj in Lantan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Visitors' Vale, a welcoming area encircled by gentle hills, was located about half a mile (800 meters) from Anchoril 's entrance. It was the location of one of the Welcome Gates .</p>
<p>On both sides of the portal stood two imposing iron sculptures, 10 feet (3 meters) in height. They represented a male and female gnome in the act of adjusting the portal's edges. These figures, appearing as harmless craftsmen, were in reality iron golems programmed to animate if any weapons were brandished or if the five primary elements (fire, lightning, cold, acid, or sonic) were magically summoned within the Vale. While these golems defended themselves, their principal directive was to push any combatants back through the portal.</p>
<p>This setup was just a surface layer of security. Around the Vale's perimeter, atop the surrounding hills, stood five flagpoles, each bearing a large Lantanese flag and a sizeable metal horn, known as a vale sounder . These sounders acted as a secondary defense mechanism, and were triggered by gnome sentinels only in the event of a golem being incapacitated.</p>
