<p>Dethed the Death Lich was a Netherese arcanist and lich who formulated several death-based spells .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Death Lich was obsessed with death. He spent much of his life in an isolated environment studying death magic in the enclave of Ioulaum . Dethed devoted much of his life to creating spells that trapped and killed living beings, which he enjoyed a great deal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dethed was born in 1869 NY (−1990 DR) . At only 25 years old, the talented arcanist turned himself into a lich. In his undead state, the arcanist developed multiple spells, including clone , trap the soul , circle of death , and finger of death . Dethed's deathly antics finally caught up to him in 2021 NY (−1838 DR) . As he took no students of his own, he performed spells on an apprentice of another Netherese arcanist. Dethed took control of the apprentice with his trap the soul spell , which was frowned upon by the enclave's archwizard, Ioulaum. Ioulaum himself killed the Death Lich after he found this out.</p>
