<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, the Kanko volcano rose up out of Kang Bay and erupted; it was said that the very skies over Koryo caught fire. The land was devastated; the city of Old Bejung , closest to Kanko, was engulfed in poisonous gas that killed all the people, before the city itself was obliterated in a matter of seconds and buried in ash. According to legend, the entire Han clan sought shelter in the vast Dang Caverns .</p>
