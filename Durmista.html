<p>Durmista was a duchy of Tethyr only in name. It was the eastern half of the elven territory of the great Wealdath forest.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The name "Durmista" was Elvish for "Forest of Twilight". Its former name was briefly Suldusk after the name of its native wild elven tribe ; however, it was renamed Durmista by Lord Rhothomir , the Treespeaker of the Wealdath.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The official borders of Durmista placed it east of its sister duchy Noromath , south of Amn , and north of the Starspire Mountains . It shared borders with Spellshire , Varyth , and Rivershire . Notably, the elves cared little for such human distinctions.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Mirthal Aendryr was the official representative of the Suldusk tribes to the queen . Mirthal usually lived at Suldanessellar , but when he had to host a human noble, he would use the old safe house of the Company of Eight , The Eight's Tree as his ducal stronghold.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The only true settlement within the eastern part of the forest was found in Suldanessellar.</p>
