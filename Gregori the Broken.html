<p>Ser Gregori the Broken was a Purple Dragon knight who met his end in the shadows of Wheloon Prison in the late 15 th century DR , only to rise again as a vengeful skeleton .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the operation of the Wheloon Prison, the Night Brigade gang took over part of the city. Agarta the Breaker operated a series of arenas where gladiatorial beasts and prisoners were pitted against each other, whether locals or not. The Purple Dragon knight Ser Gregori was one of these victims, and his remains were dumped along with the others in a small flower-dotted clearing. When the Riverside Rats sent a team into the prison to take out Agarta, Ser Gregori rose from the dead as a powerful skeleton warrior along with a small army of zombies to attack whoever they could find, before finally being laid to rest.</p>
