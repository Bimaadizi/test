<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti pit masters were mostly humanoid in form, but had many snake-body-like tentacles in place of arms.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other yuan-ti, pit masters were immune to poison and resistant to spells and other magical effects. They could turn into a snake and back at will. Pit masters could also innately cast the spells animal friendship at will and suggestion thrice each day.</p>
<p>As priests of Merrshaulk, yuan-ti pit masters knew the cantrips eldritch blast , friends , guidance , mage hand , message , and poison spray , and the spells command , counterspell , hellish rebuke , invisibility , misty step , unseen servant , and vampiric touch . They could only cast two spells each day, however.</p>
<p>Additionally, once each day a pit master could cause five creatures within 60 feet (18 meters) of it that it could see to collapse into a magical sleep for 10 minutes.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Pit masters did not use weapons or armor, instead relying on their naturally venomous fangs to deal with enemies.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Yuan-ti pit masters were priests of the ancient yuan-ti god Merrshaulk, and they sacrificed humanoids to him in order to rouse him from his slumber. They were also heavily involved in the long-term plans of the yuan-ti to take over humanoid governments and also in the efforts to protect their own cities from discovery and attack.</p>
