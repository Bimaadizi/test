<p>Perfectone Mercantile was a company that specialized in transporting goods and people by teleportation . It operated out of Longsaddle in the 1360s DR.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The company had a network of cities where it offered its services to those individuals and businesses that could afford it. The number of operations per day was closely correlated with the number of available wizards . Perfectone Mercantile relied on spellcasters that had mastered the teleport , teleport without error , and shadow walk spells, and was always looking to hire more of them. Before the company's collapse in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , it had branches in Arabel , Caer Corwell , Calimport , Longsaddle , Luskan , Neverwinter , Ordulin , Silverymoon , and Westgate .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The company offered a number of unique services:</p>
<p>The company took no responsibility for lost, damaged, or stolen property, lost time, or personal injury incurred while using their services. Cargo shipments took priority over personal teleports.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Deliveries were organized around a fixed schedule. Each city in the network had specific one-hour windows for sending and receiving to avoid the problem of persons and objects being teleported on top of or inside of each other. Profits were shared between the branches in each city according to the number of deliveries made. Accounts were settled at the close of business each day.</p>
<p>When expanding their services into new cities, Samuel Longspeak would contact wizards in town to find interested and willing partners. Once established, Grengoral Whelshire would travel to that city to post fliers and hand out pamphlets announcing the new branch.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The headquarters of the organization were located in Samuel Longspeak's 62-room mansion in Longsaddle.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Perfectone Mercantile collected and used all manner of magic items that could teleport and was known to pay above-average prices for artifacts , rings , scrolls , staves , and wands that had the capability.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The city of Ordulin in Sembia was wary of a possible siege by the Zhentarim and in 1370 DR was demanding an increase in the number of transports per day in order to mitigate the shortages that a siege would cause.</p>
<p>Some small rival merchant companies claimed that Perfectone Mercantile was corrupt, illegitimate, or monopolistic. Larger companies were of the same opinion but were also investigating setting up their own teleportation networks to compete.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grengoral Whelshire was a retired adventurer that took up the life of a merchant and worked for the Seven Suns Trading Coster , but grew jaded after years of losing wages when brigands raided his caravans and threatened his life. He came up with the idea of forming a company to transport goods and people by magical means, so he quit the Seven Suns and contacted his old adventuring buddy, Samuel Longspeak in Longsaddle, with a proposition. Samuel readily agreed and contacted six accomplished wizards of his acquaintance in six other cities, and Perfectone Mercantile was born. From the initial seven branches, the company grew to nine locations and was projecting to double that number by the end of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR .</p>
<p>The two leaders of the company disappeared in Flamerule of 1370 DR while visiting Westgate to investigate disruptions in deliveries, and the company did not survive the loss. Their kidnap and murder was executed by the Night Masks , but behind the plot was the Wagonwheel Cloak Society , a shady information broker that felt threatened by Perfectone Mercantile's capabilities.</p>
