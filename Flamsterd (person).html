<p>Flamsterd , sometimes known as Flamsterd of the Moonshaes , was a powerful wizard and famous sage residing on the island that bore his name in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a slim and dignified man of average height. He had a floor-length white beard (with some streaks of black just below his mouth), and often kept his beard tucked into his belt or flung over his shoulder to keep it out of the dirt. He was immediately recognizable to the peoples of the Moonshae Isles, even just by description.</p>
<p>He resided at his tower beneath the sea in a region of his island known as the Underwater Realm of the Wizard .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Flamsterd was an eccentric, but one who strongly held to the values of honesty, fairness, and peace. He was generally regarded as gentle, merciful, and slow to anger, but capable of terrible action when he finally lost his temper. He had impressive control over his emotions, and whenever he seemed to become angry, it was often an act meant to cow opponents or trick them into cooperating with him. He never blustered and was quiet and polite in conversation, but firm and stern when needed. He could not be pressured into making bargains or revealing secrets, and if attacked, he responded with quick and overwhelming magic . He would use time stop to disarm and neutralize his enemies, and forget to diffuse hostile situations. He preferred to avoid killing in case his victims were undeserving, but he knew that if needed, he could use his magic to speak to and apologize to their corpses. If he did not need anything from someone who attacked him, he might simply bestow a steel curse upon them and then teleport away, or perhaps teleport his attacker to some far flung land or plane .</p>
<p>His main concern was his research, so much so that anything that drew him away from his studies was guaranteed to irk him. He was hands-off with his students, and scoffed at any suggestion that he held any authority over them or the island on which he dwelt. He was unimpressed with anyone who put themselves in danger that they could not handle, even if he readily stepped in to save them from their own foolishness.</p>
<p>When not working, he enjoyed going for a stroll through the gardens of his tower, protected from the surrounding sea by a giant air bubble maintained by his powerful magic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a highly potent spellcaster who both had devised new powers as well as held great knowledge of ancient magic (including that of gates and of otherwise forgotten curses ), and he was known to wield spectacular spells that others had never seen. He was a master of spells that involved "power words" (such as power word, blind , power word, kill , or power word, stun ) and sigils (such as explosive runes or symbol ), as well as interplanar teleportation. He could readily conceal himself from any form of detection using his personal magics.</p>
<p>He was the namesake of the spell Flamsterd's flamestrike , and was responsible for spreading the secrets of several powerful spells developed by other famous wizards, notably Archveult's skybolt , Caligarde's claw , dismind , Laeral's dancing dweomer , Spendelard's chaser , Tasirin's haunted sleep , and Tulrun's tracer .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore both a ring of protection and a teleport ring . He dressed in plain gray robes over which he donned a red cloak of protection when he traveled. This cloak had the added ability to emit a gust of wind on command, allowing him to quickly extinguish fires or deflect small projectiles and giving his outfit the appearance of constantly curling and flapping in a breeze no one else could feel. He carried a longtooth dagger and several darts of paralyzation , and was said to possess a number of staves of power as well as staves of his own devising.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was passionate about arcane magical research and of advancing the understanding of the Art . He was an inventor of new spells, and often tested them on the fish outside his tower. He valued peace and privacy for his work, but he readily invited young mages to study and apprentice under him. He was most famous for this expertise in the history, lore, and workings of written magic, and to a lesser extent, the history of human settlements and achievements across northwest Faerûn and of the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles. He was the author of such works as Art of Communications and Sigils and The Moonshae Chronicles .</p>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR , Flamsterd was the protector and de facto ruler of the island of Flamsterd, which had been named in his honor. By his will, both storms and raiders seemed to leave the island alone. At the same time, he made occasional and sudden appearances around the Moonshae Isles (facilitated by his teleport ring , which he wore at all times), and was famous for his kindness. He sought to protect the weak and the needy, and to uphold peace and fair dealings across the land. He was known use his magic to help people, ranging from rescuing those in need to simply fixing leaky roofs or clearing spring ice. Sometimes he would invisibly linger around those who needed protecting or watching. He occasionally made incognito appearances at wayfires around the Moonsahes, where he doled out advice and lore to travelers.</p>
<p>If the Moonshaes came under threat, he was known to help seek out adventurers to aid the people. He freely offered his friendship and assistance, as well as some magical tutelage, to those who protected the Moonshaes, and was known to provide them with useful magic items such as potions , spell scrolls , or a rod of resurrection . To facilitate foreign adventurers' travel to the Isles, he could cause their ship to simply fly over the seas.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The peoples of the Moonshaes, from the Ffolk humans to the Llewyrr elves to the halflings to the dwarves , regarded him as a famous do-gooder, and tales of his appearances spread with rapid enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He worked with adventurers to protect the Moonshaes, and employed a weredragon named Shaleen to deliver magic items to and sometimes assist them in battle. He was also an ally to the Harpers and was known to work with the druids of the Moonshaes. Legends claimed that he was allied with the Earthmother herself.</p>
<p>He was a good friend of Elminster , with whom he had shared copies of his personal diaries, and he was a colleague of Khelben Arunsun .</p>
<p>He was known to invite young mages to study with him, or to just seek refuge from persecution at his tower. One of his failed apprentices, the evil Belistar , remained in the Moonshaes to menace the populace after having been cast out by Flamsterd.</p>
<p>He had three "wild" daughters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Flamsterd had been meddling in the Moonshae Isles since at least the 3 rd century DR. He was believed to have been partly responsible for driving the evil High King Gwylloch Cymrych and his son, Prince Ketheryll , to madness at the Castle of Skulls in the Year of the Vaasan Knot, 299 DR .</p>
<p>At some point, he came to live in Waterdeep for at least several decades. It was there that he met and befriended Elminster and came to be acknowledged as a pioneer of arcane magic . He also purchased a valuable spellbook known as The Wizard's Workbook from a band of adventurers, and he went on to make a considerable amount of money selling copies of the spells it contained. At some point, he laid a trap for his enemies in a hidden sanctum beneath an alleyway in Waterdeep: a pit baited with sacks of gold that contained a portal which sent unwary thieves into the heart of the Arcane Chambers of Undermountain .</p>
<p>At some point before the 13 th century DR, Flamsterd sought a place where he could pursue his magical research in more privacy. Thus, he purchased an island in the Moonshaes using the money he had gained from selling spells, and he along with many of his apprentices emigrated there. They established a tower on the southern tip of the island and were at first welcomed by the local Ffolk. However, Flamsterd's apprentices soon began to squabble, and when the wizard did not intervene, these squabbles soon grew violent and magical, rendering much of island nearby the tower into a dangerous wasteland. When the wizard finally lost his temper one day in the Year of the Hooded Falcon, 1291 DR , he disciplined his apprentices and then sent them away (or transformed them into toads and salamanders if they failed to leave). That same night, he worked with druids to transport his tower underwater surrounded by a massive air bubble, however achieving this caused the southern half of his island to explode. The southern peninsula came to be flooded by the sea while the northern half was rendered a wasteland, and Flamstered was believed to be dead. Rumors abounded that he had been slain out of greed by someone who desired to take The Wizard's Workbook from him, while others speculated that he had succumbed to terrible grief. Others maintained that he was alive but had simply abandoned the Material Plane .</p>
<p>He remained hidden in his undersea tower until at least the 1330s DR, with even Elminster believing him to be dead. However, by the time of the Darkwalker War in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , he had reemerged: he was once again welcoming young mages to come and study with him and he was writing and publishing books. As of the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , he was making newsworthy appearances around the Moonshaes, often performing random acts of kindness or looking out for the safety of the isles. That same year, he aided adventurers and the Harpers to prevent a plot by the Risen Cult of Bane to abduct High King Tristan Kendrick . Following this, his research helped to recover an ancient druidic spell known as sanctify sacred site , which was used to purify moonwells that were veiled by the Cult.</p>
