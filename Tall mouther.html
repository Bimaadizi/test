<p>Tall mouthers were aberrations found in the vicinity of halflings . The halfling slang "they got mouthed" was a common way for halflings to explain that someone was killed by a tall mouther.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tall mouthers were blue and furry, and had six 15‑foot (4.6‑meter) limbs that were remarkably flexible. Their body was composed of merely a large head, which was 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide with big teeth and two big eyes. The natural gait of its gangly limbs kept the head 5​ to ​7 feet (1.5​ to ​2.1 meters) above the ground.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Using their long limbs, tall mouthers preferred to swipe at enemies from outside of their foes' melee reach. Their unpredictable whirling and shifting movement also made them quite hard to hit with ranged weapons. As a result, having a wizard or other spellcaster was always welcome when dealing with a tall mouther.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Tall mouthers were the closest thing to a natural predator of halflings. They could be found following halflings all throughout the Realms. However, they dwelt primarily in the Lluirwood and on the borders Luiren . They could also be found in the High Forest , Cold Woods , and Moonwoods .</p>
