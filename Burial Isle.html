<p>The Burial Isle was a small island in the waters of Maer Dualdon of Icewind Dale , used as a sacred burial ground for the most heroic and honorable of heroes of the Reghedmen tribes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Burial Isle was located roughly in the middle of Maer Dualdon near the town of Lonelywood , but far enough to be only reachable by boat. The isle was a bleak and mostly barren place, hard to survive on. One would likely die of hunger or cold, if exiled to the Burial Isle, like some of the Reghedmen who disgraced themselves were. The waters of the lake were warm for the climate but still deadly to swim across and there were no boats on the island.</p>
