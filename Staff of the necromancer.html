<p>The staff of the necromancer was a unique enchanted staff that belonged to Hodkamset , a powerful wizard who served Set .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The alabaster staff was made from the spine bones of a dragon .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff of the necromancer absorbed magic similar to a staff of the magi . The staff could detect magic , speak with the dead , and offered protection from good . The staff had 25 charges that could be used for additional powers. The staff could animate dead , cast darkness, 15' radius , dispel magic , and hold person by expending a single charge. Expending two charges allowed the wielder to command undead , enfeeble , feeblemind , and life level drain that automatically drained a portion of a target's memories and experiences.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Staff of the necromancer was created by Hodkamset as a replica of the Alabaster Staff , a legendary artifact created by the Untheric pantheon in ancient times. However, it was said that the Alabaster Staff was twenty-five times more powerful than the Staff of the necromancer.</p>
<p>The staff was stolen from Hodkamset by priests of Osiris , but later returned to him after it was retrieved by Set's assassins .</p>
