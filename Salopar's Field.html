<p>Salopar's Field was a farm somewhere in Faerûn during the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There was a sunken road between Salopar's Field and the neighboring Aerhiot's Field . The hedges outside both fields had overgrown into the ditch-level path to such a degree that they formed a gloomy tunnel-like space underneath their intertwined branches.</p>
<h3>Flora and Fauna</h3>
<p>Birds and squirrels darted along the path every time someone trod upon it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , while traversing the path between Aerhiot's Field and Salopar's Field, the farmer Nuglar fell prey to the Slayer , a mysterious, ethereal apparition, which slew him and his three oxen , leaving nothing but dust behind.</p>
