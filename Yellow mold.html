<p>Yellow molds were a relatively common variety of underground fungal mold.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Specimens of this mold were found to display a wide range of yellow hues, ranging from pale to golden. They were most commonly found as 5 feet (1.5 meters) patches, though far larger patches were known to exist.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Being a fungus, yellow molds had no intellect. On rare occasions, colonies that grew to encompass at least 300 square feet (28 square meters) would begin to form a collective intelligence.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Anything touched one of these molds had the chance of causing a patch to release a cloud of asphyxiating spores, in a 10 feet (3 meters) radius. Sentient colonies could willingly project a spore cloud from as far away as they could sense a creature.</p>
<p>Yellow mold was very vulnerable to fire , both natural and magical. Both natural and artificial sunlight, such as that produced by the spell continual light , were known to drive yellow mold into a dormant state. In some cases, sunlight could outright destroy a patch of it.</p>
<h3>Senses</h3>
<p>Yellow mold colonies that had obtained a form of collective intelligence could sense creatures from varying degrees of distance, typically from 10​ to ​60 feet (3​ to ​18 meters).</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Yellow mold colonies that obtained collective intelligence displayed a number of unique abilities. They had a psionic sense , allowing them to detect the use of psionic abilities at varying degrees, typically in a range of 20​ to ​120 feet (6.1​ to ​37 meters).</p>
<p>Twice per day they could psionically compel other creatures in a manner similar to the spell suggestion , except those affected had a chance of being permanently drained of a small degree of their intellect. These yellow mold colonies also possessed the telepathy disciplines of mindwipe and id insinuation . Scholars once believed that these colonies needed to rest for one to four days after using their psionic abilities before they could employ them again.</p>
<p>Yellow mold colonies could not be attacked psionically unless there were a third-party, such as a cleric , who could telepathically communicate with plants. Said party was needed to channel psionic attacks into a form that could affect the colony's vegetable intelligence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1370 DR , yellow molds were one of the many fungal exports of the drow city of Ched Nasad .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , yellow mold could be found infesting the crypts of Dordrien . .</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>A "golden mold" of the exact same hue as gold dwelt in a ruined temple in Myshella . This was in spite of a phaerimm lifedrain effect operating constantly, but it otherwise acted exactly the same as a normal yellow mold.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were typically found underground, in areas that were dark and moist. Yellow molds were one of the many hazards that adventurers could encounter in parts of the Underdark . Two such places were the Whorlstone Tunnels beneath Gracklstugh and the Undermoor, the Underdark reaches beneath High Moor .</p>
<p>Yellow mold could also be found growing in the sewers of Mulmaster , the sewers of Waterdeep , and in some of the many dungeons scattered throughout Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Outside of the Prime Material plane , some encountered yellow mold growing in the land of Barovia and some parts of the Abyss . Especially those ruled over by the demon lord Zuggtmoy and Ghaunadaur 's aspect Jubilex. Such as Shedaklah , the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss .</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Some creatures would hide yellow mold inside a sack to act as a form of trap.</p>
<p>Some liches would grow patches of yellow mold in the entrances of their secret lairs to act as a first line of defense against any potential intruders.</p>
