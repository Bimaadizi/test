<p>Issacortae , also spelled Isacorte , was a language spoken by the Issacortae people of the northwestern Ama Basin . It was one of the chief languages of the region.</p>
<p>Issacortae was related to Pazruki and Wu-haltai , other languages in the Amaese languages group. Issacortae was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.</p>
<p>It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Issacortae nation had little writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations.</p>
