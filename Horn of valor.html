<p>A horn of valor was a magic item that boosted the morale of allies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This horn was made of gold but did not otherwise appear special.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When sounded, allies who heard the blast experienced a surge of morale and foes who heard the sound a lowering of their morale. Under normal weather conditions, the horn's magic was effective out to 8 yards (7.3 meters), and, even in a raging storm, the horn's magic would affect those within 3 yards (2.7 meters).</p>
<p>The horn would only function three times in a twelve-hour period; if accidentally sounded an additional time beyond that, it would lose it magical power for up to six days.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>At least one of the warriors who fought with the Moonlight Men against the orcs of the Nethertide Horde in the Battle of Turnstone Pass bore one of these horns. It was buried with the warrior in the Cairn of Moonlight in Turnstone Pass .</p>
