<p>Batalista's Passport was a variation of a ring of fire resistance originally created by the grand mage Batalista .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Batalista's Passport allowed the wearer to survive even the hottest of flames, granting them resistance to fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original ring of Batalista's Passport was created by the grand mage Batalista to protect him through his travels through the Elemental Plane of Fire . It was believed that the wizard summoned salamanders to consult them during the ring's crafting process. However, salamanders were not known for their patience. Batalista's consultant was annoyed with harassment by a mortal mage. A mysterious pyre engulfed the grand mage's tower with only one thing recovered from the ashes - Batalista's finger with the Passport on it, untouched by the raging flames. It was presumed that if the ring's finger was still attached to the wizard's hand Batalista would've survived the fire.</p>
<p>Over the years that followed Batalista's Passport was replicated and found in several locations across the Sword Coast , in the vicinity of Baldur's Gate , in Amn , and even in the Black Pits of Underdark . One of these rings could be found in catacombs under Candlekeep as well as in the iron mines of Nashkel in 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>A ring of Batalista's Passport could be used along with a regular ring of fire resistance to drastically strengthen enchantments on a Club of Detonation to a powerful +5 variation. The imp named Cespenar knew the secrets of that process.</p>
