<p>Cancerous bastard swords were somewhat more common enchanted blades that could spread magical diseases on their targets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cancerous bastard swords were masterfully crafted blades with faintly glowing blue arcane runes of power etched along their surfaces.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These blades were enchanted with morbid magic that had a fair chance of infecting the targets, upon a successful strike, with a dangerous disease that caused damage every two seconds until cured. Thus, a mere scrape by a cancerous bastard sword could prove deadly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One such bastard sword belonged to Maiden Ilmadia , one of the lieutenants of a devil known as Belhifet in 1281 DR . She laired at the bottom of an ancient dwarven foundry of Dorn's Deep on the Spine of the World . She controlled the fire giant and salamander forces of Belhifet's monster army.</p>
