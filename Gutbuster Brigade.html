<p>The Gutbuster Brigade was a famous battlerager squad founded by Thibbledorf Pwent in Mithral Hall . They had their own brand of gung-ho tactics and often disregarded the typical order and discipline in favor of a more direct approach.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gutbuster Brigade was formed in 1357 DR , when an army of drow attacked Mithral Hall. Thibbledorf Pwent hand-selected a score of dwarves to train as battleragers - a chaotic form of fighting, with various battlerager guilds having varying styles - Thibbledorf's personal 'art' consisted of putting on a full suit armor fully covered in spikes, and throwing himself at the enemy, convulsing violently and shredding them. This turned out to be a highly efficient way of fighting in the narrow underground corridors and the Gutbusters took the drow completely by surprise.</p>
<p>After Pwent's apparent death, the Gutbusters continued on. In 1484 DR , the leader of the Gutbusters was Bungalow Thump , who, following Pwent's service to Bruenor Battlehammer , was the personal bodyguard to King Connerad Brawnanvil .</p>
