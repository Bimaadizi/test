<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jaffu and his fellow kobolds were driven from their homes and forced to relocate to the Dungeon Level of Undermountain in 1370 DR . From there, the kobolds started raiding and thieving Waterdeep , which attracted the attention of the Lords of Waterdeep . Khelben Arunsun sent a hero to travel to the dungeon and stop the kobold crime-spree. The hero came across Jaffu in the sewers of the Dungeon Level, where he was tasked the kobolds' leader with the watch while his mate was guarding the looted goods one floor above. Unlike his kin, Jaffu knew that the Lords of the City of Splendors would send someone to stop the raids sooner or later and asked the lone hero to spare him and his mate.</p>
