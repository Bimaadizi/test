<p>Hakiyah was worshiped as the goddess of truth in the lands of Zakhara . She was one of the eight Great Gods of the Land of Fate and preached the value of honesty and calm examination of the truth. Hakiyah's symbol was a cresting wave. When she appeared as a human, she wore the garb of a city-dweller and guided those around her with the calm voice of reason. Like other Zakharan gods, she was above such concerns as alignment, as truth may be used by a judge to right the wronged or by an evil schemer to bring down his enemies.</p>
<p>Hakiyah's worshipers valued meditation and methodical, rationalized actions. She counted many merchants among them, especially in the Cities of the Pearl . In the Pantheist League , however, her faith was persecuted.</p>
<p>The holy slayer organization known as the Soft Whisper worshiped Hakiyah.</p>
