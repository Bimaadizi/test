<p>Ocular was an item enchantment that could be given to an armor or a shield .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ocular armors or shields sported small eye-stalks. These eye-stalks' eyes opened and closed of their own volition.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Wearing armor or holding a shield with the ocular quality did two things to the wearer or holder. First, it increased the visual accuracy and alacrity of the wielder. Second, it made it impossible for the wielder's enemies to effectively flank him or her. However, as powerful as this property was, its effectiveness relied on the visual senses of the wielder. Affecting the wielder with a blindness spell prevented the magic of an ocular armor or shield from working.</p>
<p>Crafting an armor or a shield with the ocular quality required the creator to cast the arcane eye spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ocular quality was invented by a beholder cult in Skullport that worshiped both the Great Mother and beholders. The idea behind the invention was to artificially acquire traits that made them more similar to their object of worship. While the exact time when this happened was not known, by 1374 DR , it was acknowledged to be a very old item quality.</p>
