<p>Dead Man's Face was one of the once-common enchanted helmets worn by the people that would come to be known as the Reghedmen of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dead Man's Face was a helmet of iron with a simple design: a plain helmet with a hinged faceplate. Once forged and constructed, each of the Dead Man's Faces was engraved with an image of a dead warrior's face on the face-covering. Each face belonged to a specific Reghedman, and the image was accompanied by an engraving of the warrior's name and a single word that described their death, front and center on the mask's forehead. Once completed, the helmet was left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre. A month later, Dead Man's Faces of the most valiant warriors were recovered from the ashes by the priests of Tempos and praised in their daily religious rituals.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This custom was believed to mask the dead warrior's fear of death when being judged by Tempos upon entering the afterlife. Another belief stated that the Dead Man's Faces of the most valiant warriors in Tempos's judgement would make the wearer immune to fear. Whether or not this was true, a Dead Man's Face had a protective +1 enchantment and protected the wearer from damage dealt through lucky strikes and rendered them immune to such magics as horror and cloak of fear . However, its grim appearance hampered the wearer's presence, charm, and charisma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
