<p>Mount Ghaethluntar , also known as the Great Mount of Ghaethluntar , was a huge mountain located in the extreme north of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This lone mountain stood nearly 100 miles (160,000 meters) in length. The base of the mountain was home to roaming herds of surface rothé , while it was said that the mountain itself was honeycombed with caverns linked by natural and carved-out tunnels, inhabited by thousands of flinds and gnolls . Very little was known otherwise of the mountain or its environs; in the North , it was said that few humans had ever seen Mount Ghaethluntar and lived.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The gnolls sent caravans down the Remorhaz Ride through the icy tundra, hauling 40 to 60 ore-laden sledges at a time from Mount Ghaethluntar to Frozen Flindyke .</p>
