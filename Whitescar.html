<p>Whitescar was a young purple dragon dwelling on the island of Moray in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR . He was a close ally of the Black Blood tribe .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Whitescar was greedy and imperious, interested largely in gold and domination over territory and lesser creatures. He expected to be lavishly compensated if one wished to negotiate with him. His voice was silky and spiteful.</p>
<p>He preferred to operate at night or to stick to the shadows within his lair, concealing his identity as a dragon and passing himself off as a mysterious and powerful cleric of Malar , the patron god of the Black Blood tribe.</p>
<p>In battle, he kept his distance and attacked from range with his breath weapon .</p>
<h2>Lair</h2>
<p>Whitescar's lair was located in a defunct temple of Malar that had once been the base of operations for the Black Blood tribe before they discovered a better location and gifted the old temple to the dragon. The canyons and ravines that served as the approach to the lair were lined with gigantic, bestial statues of Malar, as well as carvings of other dark and savage aspects of nature, including statues of Gruumsh and Auril . The entrance to the lair was a gateway of dark stone carved in the likeness of a gaping, bear -like maw, which led to a wide room filled with bones and decorated with statues of lycanthropes as well as holy symbols of Malar carved from bloodstone . A magical trap just within the entrance weakened those who did not venerate Malar. A few chambers deeper into the lair was Whitescar's pitch-dark sanctum, which had once been the site of the Black Blood's rituals and still contained statues of a draconic aspect of Malar. This old shrine was an enormous, partially flooded room with a 30‑foot-high (9.1‑meter) ceiling supported by pillars, and despite its size, sounds strangely did not echo. Whitescar kept his hoard deeper still within the old temple, inside a cave that required passing through solid rock to reach.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He controlled a small army of human mages , minotaurs , orcs , ogres , and wererats . These forces raided Ffolk settlements and mining operations in the Orcskulls.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His alliance with the Black Blood tribe provided him with fearful servants from their ranks who were rarely allowed to meet or see him in person. Whitescar was one of the Black Blood's most powerful allies, and his presence was a key factor in keeping the orcs, ogres, and ettins of the Orcskull Mountains under the Black Blood's thumb. He sometimes acted as a spokesperson and representative for the tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Whitescar met with the Amnian envoys of " the Fisherman " to discuss an alliance and trade relationship, offering slaves and the control of mines in the Orcskulls in exchange for high quality steel equipment for his army. At the same time that he welcomed the Fisherman's delegation to his lair, it came under attack by the ill-prepared forces of Daffyd Mac Lyrr , who had discovered a map pointing to the lair and believed it to be the Black Blood tribe's headquarters. Daffyd's campaign would ultimately succeed in defeating Whitescar, thus striking a major blow to the Black Blood tribe.</p>
