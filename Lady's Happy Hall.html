<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Marpenoth of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , when Procampur was struck by the featherlung plague, Thavil worked with High Priest Baniya Dolester of Lliira and set up auxiliary shrines in the District of the Poor to treat the sick there. Though their actions halted the spread of the disease, the Thultyrl reprimanded both high priests for breaking Procampur's district rules, and were reminded that the city and its laws were older than a number of deities.</p>
<p>Around Kythorn of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a convoy secretly transported the torque of faith , a holy item of Tymora , to The Lady's Favor temple in Sevenecho. However, the Vipers bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans at the Lady's Happy Hall temple were outraged by the attack and the theft.</p>
