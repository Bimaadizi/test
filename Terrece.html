<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Terrece and his comrades were hired by Baron Ployer to exact revenge on Harpers who ruined his slave business in Calimshan years prior. These Harper agents were Jaheira and Belgrade . Terrece's contract called for the wizards three to develop a lingering curse that weakened and eventually killed the targets. Belgrade was the first victim cursed with the deathly magic, and he expired, with Jaheira's being the next victim. Terrece completed his contract and cursed Jaheira. However, the wizard bore no love for his employer; he offered Jaheira's companion, Abdel Adrian , to hire him to "return the favor" to Baron Ployer. Even though it was unrecorded if Abdel and Jaheira agreed to the offer, Ployer was eventually tracked down and confronted by the adventurers. Terrece, Gracien, and Malacazar may have joined them at Ployer's derelict home in Athkatla, confronting the villain and likely ending his life.</p>
