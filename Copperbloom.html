<p>Copperbloom was one of the elder spiritual leaders of the Lost Vale Tribe , the saurial community in the Dalelands , the mate of saurial hero Dragonbait and the mother of their offspring - Handful and two other hatchlings.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Copperbloom looked like a typical finhead saurial. When she was performing her priestly duties in the Singing Cave - a Temple of Finder Wyvernspur, she was adorned in the typical robes of the Church of Finder Wyvernspur - simple but elegant garments, guided by the dogma that the outfit of the performer should not outshine the performance. When Copperbloom was on the road, she wore practical and simple travelers' clothes. Thankfully, like most other saurials, she relied on natural defenses of her scales.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Copperbloom was a kind and gentle woman with keen intelligence. She often lovingly scolded her deity Finder when the fledgling deity made mistakes. Like with many other followers, Finder was friends with his clerics and devotees.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Apart from being a competent cleric with access to divine magic and blessings of Finder Wyvernspur , Copperbloom was a talented poet, musician, and songwriter. Her talents were respected among saurials and humans . Her religion was focused not just on change and the evolution of music but also on individual change. She embraced that aspect of the church and quickly mastered Common language (reading, writing, and understanding, however, her saurial physiology stopped her from speaking in the alien language).</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Copperbloom shared her spiritual leadership status with Sweetleaf , and older bladeback cleric of Chauntea and the goddess of fertility and agriculture from the saurial homeworld. Together, the woman guided and trained eight acolytes who, like their superiors, worshiped Finder Wyvernspur and Chauntea.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Copperbloom was one of the unfortunate saurials who were snatched from their world by the desperate god of rot Moander who transported Dragonbait's tribe to a hidden vale on the edge of the Dalelands in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . Copperbloom and her kin were enslaved by the god's foul magics and forced to build a giant avatar for the deity - the Abomination of Moander . The saurials were forced to sacrifice their eggs to the pile of rot and refuse. Eventually, the Lost Vale Tribe was freed by hero companions of Dragonbait - Alias of the azure bonds , halfling " bard " Olive Ruskettle , Turmish wizard Akabar Bel Akash , his wife Zhara , and the Nameless Bard himself, Finder Wyvernspur . The heroes triumphed at a heavy cost. Akabar Bel Akash gave his life to stop the rotting god, and Finder seemingly perished in the magical explosion. In reality, Finder was given divinity of the dead deity and reached apotheosis. The saurials were convinced to stay in the Vale by Elminster who offered them protection and home as they repaired the damage done to the land. In the years that followed, Copperbloom took on the mantle of Finder's High Priestess in the newly constructed saurial temple and found a mate in the hero Dragonbait.</p>
<p>By Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Copperbloom was a mother of her and Dragonbait's child who was aptly named Handful . Her priestly duties expanded as she gained young followers. Copperbloom trained the young acolytes who generally were brought to the Church of Finder due to their love of music. Some of the young followers of Finder were young soul singers of the Lost Vale Tribe. As the tribe's spiritual leader, Copperbloom was in charge of greeting and welcoming pilgrims who visited the Lost Vale's temple. Eventually, her family welcomed two more hatchlings.</p>
<p>1368 DR also marked the time when Finder's favorite follower and friend - Joel the Rebel Bard made the pilgrimage to the Singing Cave while on a quest to retrieve the Hand of Bane . Copperbloom met the young cleric with a basket-full of flowers and guided him with her kindness and wisdom.</p>
