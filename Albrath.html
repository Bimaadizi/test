<p>House Albrath was a mercantile house that hailed from the city of Ravens Bluff during the midâ€“14 th century DR . Their trade involved the bulk dying of linens, laundry services and, for quite a hefty price, the discreet disposal of illicit goods, contraband and even bodies from locales throughout the Bluff. Their base of operations was located in the Altarside neighborhood within the city's Temple District , very close to City Hall , which encouraged constant jokes abut "washing dirty laundry" by the local Ravenians.</p>
<p>While they maintained a congenial demeanor on the surface, they were determined and razor-focused in their business dealings and acquisitions, which included a select few foreign assets.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>As of the year 1370 DR , the family was led by their patriarch and Merchants Council representative Embro Albrath .</p>
