<p>House Alsevir was a very old Cormyrian noble house which rose to the nobility around 200 DR .</p>
<p>The family was thought to have died out but a distant branch of the family returned to Cormyr in 1420 DR and took up residence in the old Bleth estate.</p>
<p>The family had built a considerable fortune as merchants before returning to Cormyr and, when they arrived in Suzail , began buying their way into high society. Their penchant for throwing around gold as well as their purchased titles earned them the dislike of House Crownsilver .</p>
