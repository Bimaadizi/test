<h2>Opera Across the Realms</h2>
<p>In Sembia , opera was considered entertainment suitable for nobility. The Sembian opera was accompanied by glaurs , zulkoons , and thelarrs , as well as choral clerestory. The city of Selgaunt had an open-air amphitheater used for operatic performances. The theater, the stage, and its benches were made of carved limestone . The amphitheater - the Palace of Beauty , was constructed by Andeth Ilchammar the Hulorn of Selgaunt. It was used as a theater, a concert hall, and an art gallery, and the place was a gaudy architectural atrocity. The theater's foyer was decorated by a statue of Rauthauvyr the Raven , the founder of Sembia, slaying a gorgon . Quite obviously, Sembian opera was entertainment for the rich and noble. Common folk was not allowed into the theaters. Instead, commoners frequented playhouses, and nobles who visited them did not mind mingling with simple laborers and tradesmen. playhouse Entrance fee ranged from five coppers to a single silver raven for those willing to sit in the gallery, and balcony seats were priced at one golne fivestar .</p>
<p>In the City of Splendors, Waterdeep , opera was performed in the Lightsinger Theater located in the Sea Ward . The venue sold tickets and required format attire to attend. The establishment was frequented by Mirt the Moneylender .</p>
<p>Ravens Bluff Stane Opera House was a popular and renowned theater. The most successful performers of the city opened acting schools to train the next generation of singers. And the nobility was known to hire opera singers for private at-home performances. Some noble and wealthy Ravenian families put singers, actors, and other thespians on the payroll, supporting them through their acting career's twilight years. Stane Opera House was known to put seasonal operatic performances known for their abstract experimental nature. The theater was a mere moderate success and existed thanks to noble families' of Ravens Bluff generous patronage. Stane Opera House was a grand black marble structure on the Lamorgyr's Ride .</p>
<p>Opera companies from the nation of Thay often traveled abroad to perform in other regions. Sembian opera-loving nobility considered new Thayvian operas to be an event not to be missed.</p>
<p>Opera from Tantras of the Dragon Reach was considered an acquired taste. Danilo Thann , a Waterdhavian Harper agent, once compared it to a loud unnerving cacophony of frog croaking that reverberated and seemingly closed around the listener. The sound was very similar to singing Tantrasan opera in a small bathchamber.</p>
<p>The city of Eshpurta in Amn sponsored arts and culture programs, including opera, possibly as oversompensation for being considered a backwater city.</p>
<p>Opera, on occasion, was used as a subtle weapon when handled by the Harpers. A ranking Harper agent Morala of Milil wrote an opera - Wizards in Love , to subtly undermine evil schemes by Cassana , an evil wizard with powerful friends. The Harpers could not move against the evil sorceress in the open. Instead, the opera gained popularity, informing folk of the Realms of Cassana's deeds. Eventually, the embarrassment and social backlash forced Cassana to leave North Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>The drow high priestesses of Menzoberranzan used opera as a torture implement believed by some to be a punishment greater than transformation into a drider . The drow operatic singing was the art of "producing unintelligible shrieking sounds that burn the ears and send disrupting shivers through the spine, much like the famed "quivering palm" of some clerical warriors," according to Drizzt Do'Urden .</p>
<p>Operas were even performed in the underwater cities by the sea elves of Myth Nantar . The festfall called The Whirlpool was the main opera theater of the city. The aquatic opera was performed alongside whale singing and was rumored to have healing spells woven into the music.</p>
<p>Halflings of the Realms were known for writing light-hearted comedic operas that gained high popularity among humans, dwarves , and even gnome . These hin operettas featured comedy of mistaken identities, bedrooms mishaps, and misunderstandings, and hairy male opera singers who comedically ended up wearing female lingerie while on stage.</p>
<p>Long before the 15 th century DR , a unique type of opera was popular in ancient Chessenta . The performers engaged in a singing swordfighting duel that involved trying to best one another in both opera and knightly prowess. Originally, these performances ended in blood, the finale that attracted most of its spectators. With time, bloodshed was abandoned, as well as this school of theater.</p>
<h2>Notable Operas</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , Ayryn Farlight held a scrying session for select members of the Society of Sensation of Sigil , using her sorcerous gift to observe various deities of Toril . When she attempted to scry Tymora , her magic sight was redirected by the goddess to Milil, the god-Lord of Songs, who was delighted to have an audience. The deity used magic to affix the scrying and performed a plethora of songs. Eventually, the Sensates started getting bored of the performance, to which Milil responded by starting to sing an opera - the Fall of Myth Drannor . The long and torturous performance was a punishment for trying to spy on a god.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , the matriarch of House Uskevren , Shamur Uskevren , and her unruly daughter Thazienne Uskevren attended an opera in Selgaunt's amphitheater. Strange events started affecting the nobles who attended the performance. People became affected by chaos magics, plunged into delirium, and some were tossed across time to relive their past. This was caused by the Visions of Chaos , a lost opera penned by Guerren Bloodquill. The opera was an arcane wok of music that created absolute chaos and discord. Once it started, the musicians went into a trance, mindlessly performing the magical work of theater. Shamur and her daughter successfully stopped the chaos, saving the lives of all in attendance.</p>
