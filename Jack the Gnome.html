<p>Jack the Gnome was a gnome wizard of the Silver Marches in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jack had lived in the Underdark for centuries and was at one time a student of illithids and demons in his search for greater magical knowledge. The illithids in particular taught him to escape the bounds of the corporeal and of the mortal.</p>
<p>Sometime in the mid-to-late 1200s DR , Jack had made some undetailed slight against Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon , which instilled a deep fear in the often-arrogant gnome.</p>
<p>During the war started by Obould in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , after spotting the Lady of Silverymoon, he pleaded with his host to flee, claiming that she would recognize him and use all her might to destroy him.</p>
<p>Jack the Gnome was slain by Drizzt Do'Urden .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Apparently, Jack was highly skilled at shape-changing. He often took the form of a winged snake (a jaculi ) to carry on his mischief and manipulations of the shamans of the half- orc , half- ogre tribe Clan Karuck , who resided beneath the Spine of the World in the upper reaches of the Underdark.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Jack's enchanted silk wizard robe was a magical robe that couldn't be soiled or dirtied in any way. It was taken from Jack's corpse by Drizzt as loot and given to Catti-brie .</p>
