Armond listed the accusations' specifics and reported on the Ambassador placing the blame on a new lord in the City of Ravens, Lorien Darkarrow . He also stated that the accusations had little evidence and were on shaky ground at best. Lastly, Armond Arhesian stated that Mayor Thoden interviewed the young lord at Fort Thoden . He had an alibi. Darkarrow was allegedly hurt by a black dragon 's acid and sharp teeth, but his bodily wounds were the proof. According to the Trumpeter , Sir Voltroy of Lathander was tasked by Mayor Thoden with casting healing spells on the crippled Lord.</p>
