<p>The Radiant Citadel was a city-sized locale found in the Ethereal Plane that served as a hub of commerce and culture between over a score of ancient civilizations. After the eventual decline―and in some cases disappearance―of its founder groups, the Citadel also became a repository of multi-planar cultural history and lore from numerous different worlds.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Citadel as a structure was carved out of the fossilized remains of some unknown entity that formed around the Auroral Diamond . This enormous, indestructible gemstone held profound healing powers and translocation capabilities that allowed for extraplanar travel. The hue of the luminescent crystal fluctuated on irregular time intervals, for reasons that were only speculated upon.</p>
<p>The structures and pathways of the Citadel were all carved out the same set of fossilized remains.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>A wide variety of plant life, insects, and creatures from different worlds could be found within the Citadel's Preserve of the Ancestors .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Radiant Citadel was overseen by a group known as the Speakers of the Ancestors , each member of which represented one of the Citadel's member-civilizations. They held court in an amphitheater located in the Preserve of the Ancestors . Each speaker held their position for a decade and essentially led their civilization's settlement on the Citadel.</p>
<p>Influence over decisions and essential resources were split evenly among the representatives of the civilizations linked to the Citadel.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Trade among groups and individuals was regulated by the group known as the Clavigers , keepers of the jewels that allowed for inter-planar travel to and from the Citadel. Measures were taken that commerce would be conducted on equal terms between all of the groups within.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Perhaps the Radiant Citadel's most reliable defense was its largely unassailable position in the heart of the Deep Ethereal . It was also protected by a powerful ward , which could be activated by the ruling Speakers of the Ancestors .</p>
<p>The citadel maintained no regular military or armed forces. Local law enforcement was not enforced by a single entity, but delegated to numerous smaller organizations that represented various interests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Radiant Citadel was founded by members of various civilizations from different worlds, all looking for a new home. After some time it was inexplicably abandoned by members of its founding cultures and left dormant for quite a long time. It was later repopulated and reopened to their visitors by the descendants of its founders.</p>
