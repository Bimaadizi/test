<p>Great feyrs were more powerful creatures that formed when several common feyrs combined into one.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Great feyrs closely resembled common feyrs, with the same sickly, iridescent skin, hide wrinkled and mottled like the surface of a human brain, and hunchbacked appearance. Two tentacles take the place of legs, and are helped by other, smaller tentacles. Feyrs have multiple massive jaws and between 1 and 5 gold-colored eyes. Great feyrs are approximately 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Like common feyrs, great feyrs could attack with their powerful jaws, but they preferred to rely on their spell-like abilities. Great feyrs could use both fear and emotion , the latter of which could only call upon negative emotions. Great feyrs could use invisibility , and exploited this to cast negative emotions (such as hopelessness) upon their enemies without them knowing the source. They were immune to both magical and non-magical fear.</p>
<p>Due to their immense power, great feyrs were listed as one of the two types of creatures that could devour the Death Moon Orb . The other type of creature was the tarrasque .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Unlike common feyrs, great feyrs could be found in any environment and were also active during the day, although they still preferred to operate at night.</p>
<p>A great feyr forms were several common feyrs combine to create a single larger creature. They feed on the emotions of other creatures and often toy with their meals. Great feyrs may take long trips to reach a source of powerful emotion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , denizens living near Boareskyr Bridge felt that they were doomed by the chaotic crusade of Caelar Argent . The residual magical energy, as well as the negative emotions of the people, spawned a great feyr.</p>
