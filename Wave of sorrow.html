<p>The wave of sorrow was a magical greatsword provided by the demon lord Graz'zt when he visited the mines of Tethyamar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The huge blade had a wavy shape that ended in a sharp hook-like point, making it resemble his personal sword Angdrelve . The whole blade glowed an unpleasant purple-red color that seemed to become brighter the longer one looked.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The sword had deeply unpleasant and lethal qualities in imitation of Angdrelve . It dripped a deadly acid , left unnaturally deep wounds, and was strongly chaotic . A dark force within it occasionally reached out to living creatures and attempted to snuff out their life force all at once.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The blade was once a normal weapon, but was warped and transformed by the fell influence of Graz'zt. Wave of sorrow was left behind by Graz'zt in the Eastern Reaches of Tethyamar after his schemes with the jewels of ardor and the impersonation of Hal Stoutheart were uncovered. He intentionally provided the greatsword to his foes as a reward for their efforts before voluntarily leaving.</p>
