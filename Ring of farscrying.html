<p>A ring of farscrying was a enchanted ring that allowed its wearer to contact a paired ring by way of a minuscule portal , enabling both visual and audible communication across vast distances.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The source of a ring of farscrying 's portal was the large onyx gem borne on the head of the ring . At the wielder's command, it would transform into an undersized magical opening, though still one large enough to be both heard and seen through. This necessitated the activation of the portal on the matching ring —a process that could last, at most, a minute every 24 hours—so each ring of farscrying was also able to communicate a subtle tingle to its twin, signalling the other wearer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rings of farscrying were ancient devices, for at least two were found in the ruins of a Netherese enclave . Although it, like most others, had crashed from the sky in the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , the trajectory of this particular Netherese city took it into the cold waves of the Trackless Sea . There, somewhere on the ocean floor among the Korinn Archipelago islands, the wreckage and the rings lay lost. They were not found until centuries later when the enclave's remains were scavenged by Slarkrethel , a kraken of great magical potential, who recovered two rings of farscrying from the ruins.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Pairs of rings of farscrying were notably given to members of the Kraken Society , the widespread information network that served Slarkrethel. This was due to the fact that, upon recovery of the original rings , the kraken was able to recreate the process of their fabrication, allowing him to make many more. By way of the rings ' magic, his minions were able to more readily communicate amongst each other, as well as with their mysterious leader.</p>
