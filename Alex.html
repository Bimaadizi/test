<p>Alex was a child of Highcliff on the Sword Coast North in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alex's father, Zachan , told Alex about the story that thounsands of duergar fought a battle. This caused Alex and his brother, Andrew , to gain confidence and go adventuring. However, they ended up near Highcliff Castle , where they got cornered by a bunch of wolves. Gera and Zachan asked the Kalach-Cha to rescue their sons. Upon rescuing them, the Kalach-Cha could tell the truth there were twice as many duergar, or lie that there was no battle.</p>
