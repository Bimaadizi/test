<p>A daftar was a Zakharan sea captain's most treasured item.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Daftar comprised instructions, tables, charts, etc. compiled over years of sailing the seas of the Land of Fate. A captain without their daftar found himself at a sad disadvantage while at sea. They were often jealously guarded and could never be purchased.</p>
