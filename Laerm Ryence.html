<p>Lord Laerm Ryence was a commander of the Swift Cavalry of Evermeet during the 14 th century DR . He played a tragic role in the series of events that saw the return of the phaerimm and the shades of Thultanthar return to Faerûn , his pride causing the deaths of many valiant elven warriors and mages .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had distinct silver eyes and did not hide his emotions from his facial expressions.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The elven commander was a condescending and irritable individual, especially to humans . He was ill-suited for mounted combat on the mainland of Faerûn , being uncomfortable atop the great warhorses bred by non-elves.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a trusted aid in Bladuid , a gold elf that shared his disdain of humans.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Lord Ryence led the Swift Cavalry as part of Evermeet's expeditionary company in defense of Evereska , the last elven city on the mainland of Faerûn, as it came under threat from the recently released phaerimm. In a single day he managed to draw the ire of the archmage Khelben Arunsun , and draw his forces into a losing battle near the High Moor , where the Serpent's Tail joined with the Winding Water river. Many elves were killed by Ryence's poor decisions on the battlefield, and the survivors had to be rescued by Khelben himself, wielding his silver fire against the wretched phaerimm army.</p>
