<p>Spellfire was a form of raw magic , being the raw energy of the Weave and a very rare magical power.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>It was highly coveted by many in Faer√ªn , as it allowed the user to absorb spells cast at them, internally convert it to raw magical energy, and then use it in a myriad of ways. Spellfire energies could be used to heal, to project destructive bursts of flame from the eyes, to fly, and, in rare cases, for a powerful ability known as the Crown of Fire .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spellfire usually appeared as a font of silver light and healing energy. When used in battle, it looked like a radiant blue-white flame. For a long time, the ability to control spellfire was believed to be unique to a single person each generation, but that was a fallacy: most wielders simply chose to hide their ability in order to avoid getting noticed by powerful organizations such as the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Known Spellfire Wielders</h2>
<p>The bearers of lesser and true spellfire include:</p>
<p>As of 1372 DR , other wielders of true spellfire were reported to be a mage in hiding in the Border Kingdoms , a noble of Chessenta known for their cruelty and arrogance, and a wizard whose name begins with "R".</p>
<h2>Spellfire versus Silver Fire</h2>
<p>While both spellfire and silver fire originated from the raw energy of the Weave, they didn't have exactly the same effect. Spellfire was pure raw energy, while silver fire was a power granted to the Chosen of Mystra to channel the Weave's energy in a more subtle way.</p>
