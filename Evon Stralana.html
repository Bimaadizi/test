<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a thin and sickly-looking man with dark hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Stralana worked directly under the Lady Lord or Arabel , Myrmeen Lhal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the Time of Troubles , Evon Stralana led the efforts to ferret out a traitor to the crown in Arabel, hiring on three outsider mercenaries, Adon , Cyric , and Kelemvor Lyonsbane . While the effort to find the traitor was successful, identifying one Ronglath Knightsbridge , his eventual escape aided by the same mercenaries led to a breakout of fear and paranoia in the city. The mercenaries were implicated as traitors and deserters by Marek of the Zhentish thieves' guild , in what came to be known as the "Knightsbridge Conspiracy".</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Stralana's agents retrieved information from the noted forger Gelzunduth that Cyric and Kelemvor had sought out forged documents for safe passage out of Arabel. Myrmeen Lhal directed Stralana to interrogate their own guard force to see who allowed the mercenaries to pass through the city's borders and hunt down the wanted men. They tasked the Company of Dawn adventuring band to hunt them down across Cormyr and into the Dalelands .</p>
