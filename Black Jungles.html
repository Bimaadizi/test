<p>The Black Jungles were a heavily forested region of southern Tashalar on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Black Jungles were bordered in the west by the Hazur Mountains , in the east by the Lapal Sea , and in the north by the Delphin Mountains . The jungles ran right up to the coast of the Great Sea in the south and a smaller arm of the jungles reach the coast of the Shining Sea in the north. The Tashan Gap , though it was technically a pass between the two mountain ranges, was filled with an arm of the Black Jungles. Several rivers branching off from the Lapal Sea, including the River Amarast and River Lapar , marked the end of the Black Jungles and beginning of the Mhair Jungles .</p>
