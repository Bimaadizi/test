<p>Vairshekellabex was a gray dragon who lived on an earthmote above Old Man's Head mountain in the Akanapeaks . He was allied with Tchazzar and with the help of Tiamat's clergy, he made it appear that dragonborn were attacking villages and caravans in Akanûl . This was part of Tchazzar's plot to convince Akanûl to join him in an invasion of Tymanther . Aoth Fezim led an expedition composed of members of the Brotherhood of the Griffon and genasi to the Akanapeaks where they attacked and killed Vairshekellabex.</p>
