<p>Qyraaptir the Bloodeye was a powerful beholder who once ruled the empire of Calimshan during its Third Age .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Qyraaptir was a beholder mage of intense power.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of the Raor Dynasty at the start of the Third Age, circa −1900 DR , the beholders of the Alimir Hive had been in conflict with the empire of Calimshan. By −1428 DR , hordes of beholders, supported by an army of ogres and goblins swarmed every city of Calimshan. The current pasha at the time, Violir el Cajaan IX , believed that the One Sun would save his kingdom, but Violir was petrified on the steps of his god's temple in Calimport. Qyraaptir then "sat" on the throne.</p>
<p>Qyraaptir's bloody reign lasted 26 years, during which there was no peace between humans and beholders. Eventually, a band of warrior priests , following some of the gods of the modern Faerûnian pantheon , overturned the beholder rule in Calimshan. Qyraaptir was driven from its throne, and it and the other beholders fled back into the Alimir Mountains . The victorious priest-princes established a new Calishite dynasty, the Drakhons .</p>
<p>Qyraaptir, however, escaped destruction. It maintained power and rose up another horde of floating aberrations , leading not just one legion but the entirety of the beholder surface armies. In −1280 DR , Qyraaptir once again led a force of eye tyrrants against the Calishites of the Almraiven region, resulting in a war that lasted for around 200 years, before the beholders were finally driven back and reduced in number.</p>
