<p>The Black Road was the trade route that ran through the great desert of Anauroch . It wound west from the ruins of Teshendale to Llorkh at the foot of the Graypeak Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Black Road was built by the Zhentarim in the 1340s to 1360s as part of a larger trade network through the Anauroch. It included stops at artificial oases, including Vuerthyl . Once the Black Road was completed, the rest of the network was slowly abandoned.</p>
<p>The Black Road was lost to the Zhentarim sometime during the Shadovar attempt to rebuild Netheril from 1372 DR , presumably during the Shadowbane War , until Shadovar fell in the late 1480s. The Zhentarim regained control of it after the fall.</p>
