<p>Ice trolls were a type of troll that inhabited the cold north.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ice trolls stood about 8 ft (2.4 m) tall and weighed around 400 lb (180 kg). They had sickly translucent white skin and if someone got close enough without being eaten they could see pale blood coursing underneath an ice troll's skin.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Much like the scrag , the regenerative abilities of ice trolls would only function when their bodies were immersed in water. Because of this, their lairs were typically found near lakes or rivers.</p>
<p>Ice trolls typically mated in the springtime and gave birth around the fall.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Compared to other troll species, the ice trolls were highly cooperative in order to ensure each other's survival. They were also generally smarter than most troll species and preferred the use of weapons over their fists.</p>
<p>They did demonstrate the same insatiable hunger and cruel disposition as their temperate-climate cousins.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Some ice trolls were known to fight with scale armor and mauls . Some fought with mauls made out of solid ice, known as rimehammers. Though in some cases they were also known to spit out globs of freezing slime at their enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1480 DR , ice trolls living in the Icespire Peak were gathered together with a number of other frost creatures by the legendary frost giant Hrimnir as part of his campaign to acquire the Winterforge . Those that fought for him seemed to be especially motivated to engage in cruelty and violence.</p>
<p>Later in the late-15 th century DR , a great deal of ice trolls in the North were working under Jarl Starvald .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Like all trolls , they were meat eaters and would gladly consume anything, even humanoids . What set them apart however was their ability to craft (and use) weapons and armor skillfully. They prefer armor made from the scales of remorhazes or white dragons .</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Ice trolls were commonly found in the Unapproachable East , along the Spine of the World , on the Great Glacier , and in the Icespire Peak. In the Sea of Moving Ice , they were often known to lair inside ancient ice-locked ships.</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , ice trolls were typically found in the Frostfell , the Iron Wastes , and other places where supernatural cold resided. Some resided in the frozen reaches of the Feywild , serving under the archfey Koliada .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>On the Prime Material plane, some tribes of ice trolls were known to worship the archfey Koliada.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>The ice trolls that lived in the Icespire Peak had a long history of collaborating with their local frost giants, enjoying the carnage and carrion that accompanied their raiding parties.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The blood of ice trolls was often utilized by other races in the manufacturing of frostbrands and rings of cold resistance .</p>
<p>Their hearts could be removed from a troll's body as long as their regeneration was nullified. The heart was continuously cold after its removal, and offered a form of regeneration upon its consumption. If an ice troll's heart was planted into the earth, it would conjure forth a vicious blizzard that would last for a matter of hours. It could also be used to formulate a potion of cold resistance .</p>
<p>Some hags were known to perform rituals on their hearts, turning them into magical talismans with an effect similar to brown mold .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Circa 1480 DR, there was a rumor spread among the dwarves of Clan Icehammer that the ice trolls in Icespire Peak were hearing the voice of Thrym whispering along the mountain winds.</p>
