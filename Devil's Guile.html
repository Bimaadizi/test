<p>Devil's Guile was an enchanted short sword thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite Blood War .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The sword possessed a +1 enchantment and constantly generated a potent poison that, upon entering the target's wound, weakened them, sapping away their strength. The magics imbued into Devil's Guile made the weapon only usable by creatures of evil inclinations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Devil's Guile was created alongside its sister blade, Demon's Spite , and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some claimed that Devil's Guile was born in the infinite war between Baator and the Abyss . However, that theory had little weight due to the weapon's relatively weak enchantments. It was much more likely that Devil's Guile was created and used on the Prime Material plane . One thing sages agreed on— Devil's Guile and Demon's Spite were created in the days of the long-forgotten past.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , both swords were wielded by Rinara of Westgate , an ex-member of the Night Masks . She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the vampires who took over the organization several years prior.</p>
