<p>Horseshoes of speed were enchanted horseshoes that when affixed to a horse , or similarly equine creature, such as a centaur , would significantly enhance the rate at which they moved.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These shoes were typically made of iron , always came in sets of four, and looked relatively mundane. These horseshoes weighed about 3 pounds (1,400 grams) each.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These horseshoes gave off a faint aura of transmutation magic. When affixed to the hooves of any horse, horseshoes of speed would double the rate at which they typically moved, as well as proportionally increased the distance at which they could jumping. All four of the horseshoes within a set had to be worn in order for this effect to be active, though older versions of horseshoes of speed would simply drop the rate of movement down by a margin of 25% if only three were worn. On average, there was a 1% chance with these older versions of a horseshoe falling off every 20​ to ​21 miles (32,000​ to ​34,000 meters).</p>
<p>In addition to their speed enchanting effect, horseshoes of speed would notably never wear out.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>These horseshoes were a particularly common form of magical item in the land of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p>Creating a set of horseshoes of speed required a spellcaster with the spell haste .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
