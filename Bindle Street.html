<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Bindle Street began at the city's Old Wall , where the famous store, Felogyr's Fireworks , stood. From there, the street ran north, slightly curving away from the harbor, and then back towards the water. Along the way, it passed the Blushing Mermaid , it crossed Stormshore Street , ran parallel to The Eastern Wet , and ended just a block east of Athcaulyr's Stand docks. Most of Loklee Street ran parallel, to the east of Bindle Street.</p>
