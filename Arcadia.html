<p>The Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia ( pronounced : / ɑːr ˈ k eɪ d i ɑː / ar-KAY-dee-a listen ) was the Outer Plane representing alignments between lawful neutral and lawful good in the Great Wheel cosmology model. Some characteristics of this plane were ascribed to the World Tree cosmology planes of Dwarfhome , House of the Triad , and even Dweomerheart when that cosmology became popular. Dwarfhome and the House of the Triad (which became known as Celestia ) survived the Spellplague and became part of the World Axis cosmology . Dweomerheart was destroyed at the start of the Spellplague.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Arcadia connected to Seven Heavens , Nirvana , and Concordant Opposition by portals made of either white ivory or black steel, shaped like flower trellises. These portals were few in number but rested at fixed locations in the first layer. Little is known about the other two layers.</p>
<h3>Abellio</h3>
<p>Abellio was the first layer of Arcadia in the Great Wheel cosmology. An endless stretch of orderly plains dotted with a few mountains and hills, it contained the divine realms of Clangeddin Silverbeard and Marduk .</p>
<h3>Buxenus</h3>
<p>Buxenus was the second layer of Arcadia in the Great Wheel cosmology. It contained the divine realms of Azuth and Savras , as well as Heliopolis , the shared divine realm of Horus-Re , Isis , Osiris , and Ra of the Mulhorandi pantheon .</p>
<h3>Nemausus</h3>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology, Nemausus was moved to Mechanus and was no longer the third layer of Arcadia.</p>
<h3>Orb of Day and Night</h3>
<p>The Orb of Day and Night was a great sphere perched atop Arcadia's highest peak, with one half glowing and the other half dark. It rotated evenly and continually, at all times illuminating one half of the infinite plane and leaving the rest in natural darkness. This caused day and night in Arcadia, though there was no twilight, just day and night.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The trees of Arcadia were truly extraordinary, flourishing in meticulously arranged forests and evenly spaced orchards. Their bark, shimmering like metal, varied between copper , gold , silver , or iron , depending on the species. Their foliage, ranging from deep greens to fiery reds, remained ever-present, resembling Prime planar trees that did shed their leaves, though these never did. The enchanted fruit they bore was perpetually available, possessing magical properties. Once harvested, the fruit retained its potency for one to ten days before inevitably spoiling, regardless of preservation efforts, and granted effects akin to random magical potions.</p>
<p>Many woodland creatures roamed the mountains, hills, forests, and fields of Arcadia. They resembled Prime Material creatures except for their coloring, which was metallic like the trees, and their eyes, which were white without iris or pupil. Examples included copper colored rabbits, golden foxes, and sheep with silver wool. Organized, hive-dwelling insects such as ants, bees, and wasps were also found in this plane. None of the animals could speak but all were peaceful in nature and native to the Outer Planes so they were unaffected by magics that usually worked on Prime Material creatures. In addition, their eyes allowed them to see through any illusion and the more intelligent animals could be trained into superb watch beasts.</p>
<p>The primary inhabitants of Arcadia were the spirit legions formed from the souls of good and lawful warriors, much like their evil counterparts in Acheron . Other sentient creatures that dwelled in Arcadia included hollyphants , planetars , foo creatures and the occasional deva . It was not uncommon to see creatures from neighboring planes visiting: shedu , greater and lesser lammasu , and ki-rin for example.</p>
