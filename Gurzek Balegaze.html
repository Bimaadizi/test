<p>Gurzek Balegaze was a particularly friendly imp from the Nine Hells that dwelled within Helm's Hold during the city's occupation by the Ashmadai in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gurzek was quite knowledgeable about the function of arcane magic in the Realms following the Spellplague , specifically how it was wielded by fiends of the lower planes and the warlocks with which they made their infernal pacts. Gurzek believed these powers were ill-suited for solitary spellcasters and more beneficial for cults and other sects of like-minded individuals of middling power.</p>
<p>Gurzek had quite a critical eye for examining infernal contracts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , during the Siege of Helm's Hold , Gurzek on a whim worked with an adventuring wizard to education them about infernal contracts and the powers that hellfire warlocks could wield. Gurzek took a personal if fleeting interest in the wizard, and used the occasion to practice the common tongue and enjoy a bit of entertainment with a mortal.</p>
<p>Gurzek's stay on the prime Material plane was brief, as he had to return to work after a "week's time" on Toril .</p>
