<p>Zoey was staking out a known safehouse occupied by Karzov when Hawthidon sent an intrepid adventurer seeking the stolen Crown of Neverwinter to work with her. When the Nashers realized the Guard were onto them, they set fire to the building to cover their escape. Zoey and the adventurer pursued them through the burning building, defeated Karzov's guards, but Zarzov escaped to the Nashers' warehouse headquarters.
