<p>Duilya Evendusk was an inhabitant of Cormanthor in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>At one point, she and a number of her friends employed a mind-linking spell and another to convert tripleshroom sherry to water as it was drank.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was slim, but not as slim as she'd been in her youth.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She owned a bower .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Until 241 DR , she was fearful of facing her lord. She was, however, sadistic enough to hope that the human armathor's hunt was something they could scry on. She turned out to be reasonable enough to help the others attempt to stabilize Cormanthor in light of the human armathor's situation, however.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She had a number of friends whom she let in on every intimate detail. She had grown somewhat distant from her husband in 241 DR , but they grew closer on that year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241, after Elminster Aumar was named Armathor by Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , she met with the ladies of other houses at Satyrdance Pool . There, while she was rebuked by her friends for her indifference to the fate of Cormanthor , she ultimately agreed to get closer to her own husband to help stabilize the city, as the human armathor was expected to be a prelude to a new Coronal and thus a period of strife. Later, using a spell to link her mind to that of her friends, she got her husband's attention.</p>
<p>Later that year, after the future raising of the Mythal was announced, she told her husband that it was a possibility that a future Coronal might use the mythal differently, as there was no reason its spells should not affect elves.</p>
<p>In 261 DR , Duilya was present at court during the laying of the mythal .</p>
