<p>The Lostafinga Tribe was a bloodthirsty and organized tribe of hobgoblins from the Kryptgarden Forest . They distinctively removed the little finger from the left hand of each of their victims. Later, they served the vampire hill giant Morg in Southkrypt Garden .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Lostafinga hobgoblins were organized by rank; there were troopers, sergeants, lieutenants and sub-chiefs. The troopers were assigned epithets to use in place of their names. These nicknames could be derived from something in the hobgoblin's history, or some other defining characteristic. Higher-ranked hobgoblins were known by their title and real name. Each Lostafinga troop consisted of 22 hobgoblins, including a lieutenant and two sergeants. A group of five troops was called a company, and each company was led by a sub-chief. The Lostafinga hobgoblins also had a force of 20 carnivorous apes which they had trained for use in combat; and troops were often accompanied by one, together with an ape handler.</p>
<p>Shamans also held positions of leadership in the Lostafinga tribe.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lostafinga tribe attacked merchants and caravans that passed near Kryptgarden Forest. Lostafinga hobgoblins all carried small hand axes , which they used to remove the left little finger from any enemies that they killed. They believed that this forever enslaved their victim's soul to Maglubiyet in the afterlife. The severed fingers were then mummified by the female Lostafingas and strung on necklaces worn by warriors. A warrior who had more fingers on his necklace was considered to be stronger. The fingers of larger creatures did not fit on necklaces, but were instead pickled and kept at home.</p>
<p>Once they had became the servants of the vampire hill giant Morg , they captured food for him and trapped adventurers in his lair in Southkrypt Garden.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>They attacked in ambush by painting their skin and armour with forest colors in order to camouflage themselves. A Lostafinga ambush was signalled by complete silence, as all the forest animals had fled. They never surrendered or ransomed prisoners.</p>
<p>Orders were sent out by written letters in the hobgoblin language .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to legend, Gar-Nu-Kee was the leader of a tribe of hobgoblins. They journeyed from mountains in the north, to Kryptgarden Forest, and entered the territory of Krazel the ancient green dragon and her three children. The dragons would only allow the hobgoblins to stay in the forest if they regularly gave up one of their own to be dragon food. The bold Gar-Nu-Kee declared that hobgoblin meat was unappealing in both texture and taste. Krazel forced him down, and bit off the little finger from his left hand. Disgusted, Krazel spat it out and acceded to Gar-Nu-Kee's new terms - that the hobgoblins would provide the dragons with the meat of other creatures instead. Although this story of how the Lostafinga tribe got its name and practice of severing fingers was a legend, it was likely rooted in truth. Gar-Nu-Kee's distant descendant Shar-Kee also became the leader of the tribe.</p>
<p>An attack squad of hobgoblins from the Lostafinga tribe discovered a castle in the southern end of Kryptgarden Forest. They attacked the castle during the night, and With the power of their carnivorous ape overcame its defenses and killed its inhabitants. The only survivor from the castle was its wizard owner , who escaped into the forest but later died. The hobgoblins took over the castle and converted it into a military outpost for their operations in Kryptgarden Forest. Shar-Kee replaced the hobgoblins that were stationed in the castle every 40 days.</p>
<p>The second group to occupy the castle was led by lieutenant Julla , who ordered his men to search the keep for treasure. They encountered a ghoul in the mausoleum, and locked it away. A hobgoblin fell into a magic pit trap . The conceited Julla was enraptured by a magic mirror that reflected a flattering image back at him. Shortly after, the castle was attacked by adventurers, including a niece or nephew of the wizard who had come to inherit their uncle's home.</p>
<p>The Lostafinga tribe accepted the unusually well-presented hill giant Morg into their ranks as a mercenary. Together with Morg, the hobgoblins attempted to invade Southkrypt Garden , but were turned back in a fight. Morg was fatally injured, and the Lostafinga tribe left him for dead. However, he was empowered by dark forces and became a vampire . He returned to the Lostfinga tribe to exact his revenge, killing one of them each night. A shaman of the tribe struck a bargain with Morg, promising their service in exchange for their lives. Morg accepted, and made Southkrypt Garden his new lair.</p>
