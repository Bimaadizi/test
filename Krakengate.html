<p>A krakengate was a massive, perpetually functioning portal constructed beneath the seas of Toril to allow for the rapid, underwater transport of Slarkrethel , a magically gifted kraken , and his network of subjects, the Kraken Society .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>As of Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the krakengates numbered four, all built beneath the Trackless Sea to the west of the Sword Coast . One sea gate lay within the ruins of Ascarle , the headquarters of the Kraken Society, while another was on the ocean floor near the Ice Peak , 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of the volcanic island. The two others were even further south: one was 150 miles (240 kilometers) off the coast of Leilon , in a chasmic trench, while the last was kept hidden in an underwater cavern below the Whalebones archipelago.</p>
<p>Though the Trackless Sea krakengates were built uncounted years prior, work was also being done in the Trench of Lopok —a channel deep beneath the Inner Sea —to construct a fifth. Slarkrethel's reasoning behind this venture was unknown, but it was speculated that if he lacked the divine backing of Umberlee , then the prospects of the krakengate 's completion were doubtful.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The krakengates themselves were arches constructed of solid stone. Their surfaces, spanning hundreds of feet in diameter, were etched with symbols of arcane origin, making them an impressive sight. Despite their potency, the krakengates could not be found by means of a spell or similar magic. It was even said that the krakengates were entirely immune to both magic and psionics as a whole, being unaffected by their use.</p>
