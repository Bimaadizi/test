<p>Liaga Kintree was a druid agent of the Emerald Enclave and a merchant from the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Liaga Kintree was a fair-skinned elven woman with pleasant features, big brown eyes, and brown hair gathered in a bun. She wore a druid's garb of simple burlap cloth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Liaga Kintree was an uncommon sight â€“ a druid and a member of the Emerald Enclave, selling her goods on Westgate's Market Triangle . Her affiliation was not a secret, and the druid was openly willing to discuss how a member of the organization from the Vilhon Reach ended up in Westgate. Liaga's orders were to learn all she could about the city and improve relations between the city folk and nature. The druid believed that opening a shop to help the inhabitants of such a city of coin was the best course of action. One of the complications Liaga faced was her immune system not being used to the crowded city and all the illnesses that it brought. However, the druid insisted on running her shop despite being sick, sniffly, and congested. Liaga refused to cure herself with druidic magic, believing it to be a vulgar abuse of power as sickness was part of nature.</p>
