<p>Gothma was a legendary fabled giant vampire bat who was said to live underneath Gillian's Hill 's graveyard, feeding on stray cattle.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Little was known about the legendary beast. However, a big statue dedicated to Gothma was constructed in the crypt where stories said he lived. The locals eventually made it a tradition to leave small gifts to the monster at the statue, such things as coins, jewelry, potions , and other precious knickknacks. Worryingly, the same chamber that held Gothma's stature was a home to a large population of bats .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The myth of Gothma was a long-standing scary story told to the children of Gillian's Hill, but even adults sometimes looked up into the night sky with a feeling of gnawing agitation. The dreaded vampire bad was blamed for disappearances of the hamlet's sheeps and cows as the stories said the monster swooped from the sky, snatching the beasts away. Some older farmers told a tale about a group of destitute folk who lost too much of their livelihood to Gothma. Armed with pitchforks and torches , they set out against the bat, venturing into the crypts under the graveyard where the creature laired. According to the story, the farmers were turned into vampire lords who were cursed with the unlife of servitude to Gothma.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , a vampirism -like plague-stricken the folk of Gillian's Hill. Some locals, including the mad hermit Mabda , thought that it was Gothma who cursed the peasants, raising them to unlife after the burial. However, it was not true. As the Hero of Daggerford discovered, some locals saw a necromancer Daxiong who wore a cape that made him look like a bat. He made a laboratory in the crypt underneath the graveyard. The necromancer was not responsible for the plague, instead using the corpses of the disease's victims to perform his vile experiments.</p>
