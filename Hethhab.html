<p>Hethhab was the current incarnation of Anhur in Mulhorand in 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hethhab was the protector of the eastern sections of Mulhorand. He wandered with six disguised divine minions of Anhur.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite being the incarnation of a god, Hethhab kept this secret in order to avoid a personality cult centered on him. He became famous as a slayer of monsters and so the vizier Rezim appointed him as Defender of the Eastern Way, a very dangerous position. The fact that Hethhab was still alive concerned Rezim, who did not knew his true identity.</p>
