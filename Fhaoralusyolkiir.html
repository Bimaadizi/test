<p>Fhaoralusyolkiir ( pronounced : /ˈ f oʊ ɜːr ə l uː s aɪ eɪl k ɪər / FOUR-uh-loo-sy-ale-keer ) was an Aryselmalyn garrison city, a primary garrison for the empire's capital city Coryselmal , that stood for centuries until eventually being abandoned and left to ruins in -80 DR . In the late 6 th century DR , members of the Church of Deep Sashelas moved into what remained of Fhaoralusyolkiir, repurposing it into a temple to Deep Sashelas .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This city was nestled along and built into the subsea cliffs of Turmish , between Alaghôn and the Aprhunn Mountain , near the mouth of the Vilhon Reach . Its city gates and grandiose guardposts, with gleaming tridents made of blaze coral , were set into the edge of the underwater valley of the Vilhon Reach.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>By 1371 DR , about two hundred sea elves lived in Fhaoralusyolkiir, though most were tied to its temple.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fhaoralusyolkiir was founded in the year −8923 TS (−8993 DR) . It would continue to stand following Aryselmalyn Empire's demise in −185 TS (−255 DR) , not becoming entirely abandoned and left to ruin until −10 TS (−80 DR) . As the years passed, much of the city built into the cliffside would be buried by collapsing caverns.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Sable Spider, 573 DR , the Church of Deep Sashelas took up residence in the palace once lived in by the garrison city's commanders, turning it into a temple to their god. This state of affairs would continue well into the 14 th century DR, with the city still retaining some vestiges of its grandeur.</p>
