<p>The Dragon Trail was a route in the East Reaches of Cormyr connecting the Moonsea Ride to the town of Hillmarch and then to the East Way . It ran along the southern foothills of the Gnoll Peaks .</p>
<p>The defensive fortification of Slingdyke overlooked the westernmost point of the trail. As of 1368 DR , an inn used to sit at the northeastern point of the trail intersection, across from the fort, but a mysterious royal degree forbade the rebuilding of the place after it burned down. A Purple Dragon guard station was erected to the east of the ruins.</p>
<p>Across the trail from the ruined inn were its old paddock and stables—complete with a horse pond—which were later used as a free campground for travelers.</p>
