<p>The Broken Crown Inn was an inn found on the High Road north of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was situated just off the High Road and not far inland from Raven Cliff Beach and the ruins of Cragmire Keep and Angelhead Mine .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Broken Crown Inn was rather modest in size: it was two stories tall and did not boast many rooms, though parts of it were incomplete and under construction. The building was timber framed, with stone-brick walls on the ground floor and plastered walls on the upper floor, while the roof had wooden shingles. The ground floor was given over to a taproom, while the upper floor had a few rooms for guests.</p>
<p>In front of the inn was a well and behind it was a water wheel that emptied into a nearby pond, though the source of the water and its purpose and function are unknown.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>In addition to room and board, the inn was a decent enough place to find work. Bounty officers could be found staying at the inn, offering recompense for those who helped rid the area of bandits and other criminals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Its first owner was a sympathizer of Luskan who believed the rulers of Neverwintan should be overthrown, hence the name "Broken Crown".</p>
<p>Some time in the 1470s DR , the inn was purchased and re-opened by Gorun Pricebreaker, a dwarf merchant who sought to profit from the re-emerging trade traffic that had sprung up along the High Road.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the inn became a hub of activity for adventurers , Harpers , and others who were taking actions against the Blackdagger Bandits that had taken over the ruins of Cragmire Keep and preyed on caravans on the High Road.</p>
