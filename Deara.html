<p>Deara was a priestess of Deneir at the temple of Deneir in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the early 1360s DR .</p>
<p>Deara desired to create the perfect scribe , and so in the temple's vaults she sculpted and animated a clay golem . In one particular test, circa 1362 DR , the golem drove a quill through a wooden writing desk, smashing it in the process. Thereafter, the golem was put to work as a guard and porter in the temple's main hall.</p>
