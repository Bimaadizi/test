<p>Snowshoes were a type of footwear common in arctic regions, such as the Great Glacier and the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snowshoes were oval frames of wood, 3 feet (0.91 meters) long and 1 ft (0.3 m) wide, with a web-like layout of rawhide or sinew strips laced within it.</p>
<p>Those sold in Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue were typically constructed with duskwood .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Snowshoes gave wearers the ability to walk upon the surface of snow, rather than having their feet sink within it. Thus they enabled a wearer to move faster and less impeded in arctic regions than normal footwear would allow.</p>
