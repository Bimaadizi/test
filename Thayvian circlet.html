<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>These Thayvian circlets were tools to aid the Red Wizard in fending off competition from other wizardly organizations, such as the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan and the Zhentarim . One such item belonged to Magda , the proprietress of the Veil Theater in the Rashemi city of Mulsantir . She offered the circlet for sale to the theater guests.</p>
