<p>Tsagoth was an undead blood fiend of the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tsagoth was huge with a purple-black scaly hide. He had a lupine muzzle with great fangs and red eyes. He had four clawed hands.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a blood fiend he fed on blood, preferably of other fiends . As vampires preyed on humans , so blood fiends preyed on demons . Like vampires, Tsagoth could also transform other creatures into their kind, as he demonstrated on Mari Agneh .</p>
<p>Most wounds inflicted on him would heal in mere moments.</p>
<p>Tsagoth could dissolve into vapor. In this form, he could float along walls and ceilings, being not quite invisible but fairly inconspicuous while making not a sound or passing through cracks in the wall. He also could transform into a gigantic bat .</p>
<p>He was able to control one's mind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Tsagoth was summoned by Szass Tam to Thay to find Mari Agneh. She was to be used to kill Aznar Thrul .</p>
<p>The blood fiend was further used as soldier in Szass Tam's undead army during the following war of Thay in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . Tsagoth joined in the marine fight between the fleeing zulkirs and Szass Tam's legions, finally facing up with the vampire Tammith Iltazyarra again, determined to kill her. After a short fight, he had her heavily injured and incapacitated. The vampire's lover, Bareris Anskuld , his friend Mirror , and Bareris's griffon Winddancer joined the fight, turning it in their favor and almost killing the fiend. In a desperate move, Tsagoth grabbed Tammith, together breaking through the railing of the ship and plummeting into the sea. Due to her vampire nature, the water immobilized Tammith completely, slowly dissolving her body like acid. Bareris and Winddancer followed them into the water, resuming their attack on Tsagoth until the fiend was forced to translate himself through space into safety.</p>
