<p>Segojan Earthcaller ( pronounced : /ˈ s ɛ g oʊ dʒ ɑː n / SEH-go-jan ) was the neutral good gnome deity of earth and nature . Unlike his ally Baervan Wildwanderer , who was a god of the plants and forests of the surface world, Segojan's area of concern was the deep earth and the life within it. Segojan was also seen as the gnomish god of the dead, for the forgotten folk interred their fallen kin into his domain. His holy symbol was a glowing gemstone ; usually this was a finely cut gem of any type in which illusion spells had been cast to provide magical light.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Segojan was closely allied with all of the Lords of the Golden Hills , with the exception of Urdlen. Aside from gnomish gods, Segojan was most closely allied with other deities of earth and nature , and to a certain extent, death .</p>
<p>His central foe was Urdlen , for Segojan's domain was most threatened by the Crawler Below. His other enemies were Cyric and Abbathor .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>The highly organized Church of Segojan was prominent within most rock gnome communities. In conjunction with the Church of Baervan Wildwanderer , they worked to protect and preserve the natural world, especially below the surface. With the Church of Flandal Steelskin they oversaw the safety of mining operations, and with the Church of Callarduran Smoothhands they sought to forge ties between settlements of deep gnomes in the Underdark and rock gnomes on the surface.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Segojan was one of the oldest of the Lords of the Golden Hills, and he once oversaw many aspects of gnomish life that were later the preserve of other deities, such as nature in general (which was later divided with Baervan Wildwanderer ), mining (which passed to Flandal Steelskin ), jewelry-making (which passed to Garl Glittergold ), and magic (which passed to Baravar Cloakshadow ).</p>
<p>It was also said that in ancient times, it was Segojan who gifted rock gnomes with their ability to speak to burrowing animals.</p>
