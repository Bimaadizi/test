<p>The Ravager was a powerful, magical halberd of unknown origin. It was an absolutely gruesome weapon with a shaft that continually dripped with blood.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed several variants of the Ravager weapon , each possessed a +1 , +2 , +6 m and +8 enchantments what made the halberd's blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. The +4 halberd allowed the wielder to cast the spell cloak of fear twice per day. If the head of the Ravager was combined with the serpent shaft , it was capable of near-effortless decapitation with its keen blade. Other variants of the blade were enhanced with dealing sonic damage to the enemies and had a chance of rendering them dazed after a successful strike.</p>
<p>A copy of the Ravager could be created from an enchanted halberd and a vial of dragon blood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While it was not known where the Ravager was forged, or even if it came from Toril at all, it made an appearance in a notable battle during the Bhaalspawn saga, in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . It was wielded by Imix , the Elemental Prince of Fire , as he defended the subterranean lair of Yaga-Shura .</p>
<p>Powerful varieties of these halberds were believed to be ancient and to have demonic origins. The guards of the Zhentarim who were tasked with standing atop the Darkhold walls were armed with the Ravagers purchased from the Hellish forges in exchange for the souls of captured heroes and adventurers . These Ravagers were immensely valuable and the masters of Darkhold were connected to each copy of the halberd, allowing them to track and retrieve them if ever lost or stolen.</p>
<p>The Ravager with a simpler +1 enchantment was forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, a more powerful version was created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
