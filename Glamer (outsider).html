<p>A glamer was an incorporeal entity whose existence was attributed to the death of the deity Leira . It was inherently adept at casting illusion magic and in fact enveloped itself in an illusory appearance.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The exact appearance of a glamer was unknown to all as their kind preferred to obscure themselves in illusions. Some said they resembled will-o'-wisps that were enveloped in a thick fog.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A glamer was a capricious being that was just as likely to help an individual as it was to be mocking or cruel. It would just as easily play a game with an individual as it would deceive them into carrying out some plot for its own amusement.</p>
<p>It was not one to place its faith in others and often spoke in a cryptic and befuddling manner.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Due to its nature and origin, a glamer had a myriad of divinatory and illusory spell -like abilities at its disposal. At all times, it could sense magical effects , comprehend arcane texts , and form telepathic bonds with others. It was able to change its appearance at will and form a variety of illusions a number of times each day.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Glamers were almost wholly solitary entities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The glamers were believed to have been formed in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , when the avatar of Leira was slain by the mortal Cyric . Her divine essence was released from her body and motes of its power traveled to her temples across Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , a number of glamers used a spell to completely shroud the Whamite Isles to all, except for Borran Klosk of Turmish . While some faithful Leirans believed this event heralded their goddess' return, others thought it was part of a scheme to exact revenge on Cyric.</p>
