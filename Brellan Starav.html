<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR, Brellan Starav was amongst the audience to which Pavel Shemov explained the situation regarding Zhengyi 's impersonation by Sammaster . The commander was against aiding him, for he had consorted with Brimstone , but the queen overruled him. He was not chosen to aid the vampire's foray into the Plane of Shadow , however, as the queen preferred some of the top knights remain behind in case of failure.</p>
<p>Once Gareth Dragonsbane was returned, he was involved in the planning of his rout of the Bandit Army of Vaasa .</p>
