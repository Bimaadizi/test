During their evening feast, Axelord brought up the rumors that the fires last spring had been set by sorcery, which the elven lord rejected. Then the Herald Huntinghorn arrived at the castle, and Breiyr swiftly invited him to the dinner.</p>
<p>The herald confirmed the rumors as far as he knew, and brought up the Magelords of Athalantar as the certain culprits. As the elven lord attempted to cast a spell, the dwarven lord responded swiftly and slew him. The elf melted into the form of a man, recognized by Breiyr's Knight of the Gate as Ubriien Orlyn , Mage Royal of Athalantar . The herald revealed himself to be Myrjala Talithyn , a local sorceress, and took her leave.
