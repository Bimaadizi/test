<p>Halwarin was a priest of Bane and member of the Zhentarim who led the Holy Keep of Bane in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A former adventurer, Halwarin established the Holy Keep in the mid-1300s DR . He was committed to spreading the Banite faith to the stars, but after eight years it remained a lesser faith in Bral, and this was not aided by the god himself being inconveniently dead.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the 1360s DR members of the Tenth Pit on Bral contacted Halwarin; they sought to use the Banite faith to gain power, but Halwarin would not yoke Bane's cause to theirs.</p>
