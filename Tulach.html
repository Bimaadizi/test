<p>Tulach was a small town in the land of Chessenta during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It rested between the hills of the Maerwatch and the Adder River on the western edge of the Fields of Oriam , roughly centered between Luthcheq , Pandrick , Maerchlin , and Oslin .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Despite its small population of 1,100, Tulach was ruled by a self-proclaimed King. He was known for sending mercenaries to eliminate rust monsters in the mines of the Maerwatch, which were rich in metals like copper and silver . The rust monsters inevitably returned, so he would send more hirelings every decade to clear them out again.</p>
