<p>An orb of draconic influence was a powerful magic item that allowed a dragon to influence the behaviors of other dragons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The orbs were spheres of dark green obsidian decorated with intricate geometric etchings and gold filigree. They employed the same fundamental magic as an orb of dragonkind .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A dragon could use an orb to subtly influence the behaviors and dispositions of all dragons within 10 miles (16 kilometers). Usually, the wielder would concentrate on a single command or feeling they wished to impart on all nearby dragons, such as "attack" or "friendly."</p>
<p>An orb also afforded some protections to its wielder: its magic both blocked scrying of any kind and discouraged dragons and other members of dragonkind from attacking the wielder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orbs of draconic influence were created by dragons in order to be used against other dragons. Some sages proposed a divisive theory that the orbs could be used to cause a so-called " dragonflight ", the phenomenon wherein a large group of normally solitary dragons of various alignments would suddenly decide to behave in synchronicity.</p>
