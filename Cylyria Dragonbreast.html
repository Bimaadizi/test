<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cylyria was a high-ranking member of the Harpers , famous in half of Faerûn for her singing voice. She was also a survivor of the Harpstar Wars, which she came back from much quieter and with a much more grave personality. Circa 1326 DR , Cylyria, aided by Khelben Arunsun , became ruler of the city of Berdusk and leader of the western branch of the Harpers. In Tarsakh of 1370 DR , Cylyria was magically attacked, leaving her comatose mere days before the trial of Khelben that would result in his and Laeral Silverhand 's expulsion from the Harpers. However, at the time, Obslin Minstrelwish told people that she was merely ill and restricted to bed rest. When she woke up after the trial was over, she was powerless to prevent the damage done by these events for the rest of the year</p>
<p>When the Church of Tyr accused the Harpers of hiding the Balance of Belaros from them after it was reported to be in Berdusk, Cylyria volunteered to undergo questioning by Holy Justices under Discern lies spells to refute the claim.</p>
