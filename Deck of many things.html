<p>A deck of many things , also known as deck of hazards , was an assortment of magical cards or metallic plates that were arranged in a set deck. They were enchanted with great magic that was never to be used lightly.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While each deck of many things was different, they held some common properties. The majority of decks found contained 13 cards, while approximately 1/4 of them held 22. They were typically made of vellum or ivory , but could also be cast from thin sheets of metal. They were often kept in a small pouch or ornate box.</p>
<p>The cards were named and each was adorned with a unique portrait that shimmered with a radiance of power. A 13-card deck included the sun , moon , star , throne , key , knight , the void , flames , skull , ruin , euryale , rogue and jester cards, while a 22-card deck added the vizier , comet , the fates , gem , talons , idiot , donjon , balance and fool .</p>
<p>While usually a deck of cards, a deck of many things could, on the rare occasion, come in another form, such as a circle of twenty two doorways, or a twenty two sided die.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The exact powers of each individual deck were not known until the cards were drawn. Before this, an individual declared how many cards they intended to draw. They did so randomly and had to wait one hour before drawing again. Any extraneously drawn cards had no effect and if an individual failed to draw the number of cards they'd previously declared, then all the remaining cards flew from the deck and took effect.</p>
<p>Once a card was successfully drawn, its magic immediately took effect and then it faded into oblivion, but instantly reappeared as part of the deck . This made it entirely possible that the same card was drawn more than once. The exception to this rule were the fool and jester cards, which truly disappeared once drawn.</p>
<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>The following effects were known to afflict, benefit, or otherwise change whoever drew the card:</p>
<p>These effects were imbued within the 22-card deck:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The original deck of many things in the whole multiverse was created by the Greyhawk god of luck, Istus, after a human woman named Asteria made a deal with them to save her friend, the medusa Euryale. Due to the divine nature of the cards, from then on myriad versions, each slightly different, started manifesting across the multiverse.</p>
<p>On Toril, the original decks of many things were created by the ancient Empire of Netheril . Then, these decks were nothing but decks of game cards known as decks of hazards . This casual deck-building game was played with slightly enchanted cards competitively. After the fall of Netheril, the magic contained in surviving decks steeped and swelled into the potent cards known across the Realms for their dangers and possible beneficial effects.</p>
