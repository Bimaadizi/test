<p>Jarnon was a member of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers from Suzail , active in mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , Jarnon could often be found in the Society of Stalwart Adventurers' library. There, he participated in the reenactments of famous Cormyrian historic battles, using enchanted miniature infantry and monsters. These reenactments were a sort of a war game with several strict rules. During one such match, Jarnon unleashed a tiny lead red dragon to smite his opponent. This act was called a foul by his opponent, and the little dragon's flames damaged the guild's expensive Shou carpets. This event happened shortly before everyone present in the library witnessed Ariast 's hands being crushed by a mysterious four-armed humanoid, seeming in service of Artus Cimber .</p>
