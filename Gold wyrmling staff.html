<p>A gold wyrmling staff was an enchanted dark wood quarterstaff engulfed in perpetual flames.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This staff's ends were constantly ablaze with flames, seemingly fueled by air and leaving no scorch damage on the weapon itself. In addition to the fire damage the weapon dealt, it possessed a simple +1 enchantment that guided it toward the target and boosted its damage even further.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , one such staff belonged to Roah Moonglow , a hin agent of the Zhentarim who did business with the recently emerged Cult of the Absolute in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn .</p>
