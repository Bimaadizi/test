<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before being an adventurer, Nuressa had been en slaved .</p>
<p>In a warm day of Mirtul in the Year of the Missing Blade, 759 DR , the group Nuressa was with ran into a Netherese tomb. In the main room, they spotted a body floating up near the ceiling, and four pillars in a large room. As Iyriklaunavan cast a spell to bring down the corpse, the pillars sprouted hundreds of eyes and attacked them.</p>
<p>After managing to get away from the pillars of eyes, which the corpse attacked and destroyed after animating, the body approached the adventurers and asked what year it was. Nuressa replied with the date, to which the corpse immediately teleported away. The team decided to flee the tomb and leave it unexplored.</p>
<p>Later, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly afterward; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to Mystra , they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan magically verified their account, while Nuressa did not find out until Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR ; all four, however, became Lords of the Castle.</p>
<p>During the chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Nuressa donned her armor for the first time in years upon hearing an explosion coming from the study of Iyriklaunavan and his student, Rauntlavon , almost causing damage to the castle room in which they worked. As Nuressa arrived, he revealed that they'd been able to farscry that Azuth had just been magically attacked in the presence of a Chosen of Mystra , and that said Chosen was the body that had escaped back when they were in the Netherese tomb. Iyriklaunavan saw fit to reveal to her they'd been blessed by Mystra, and the process of their acquisition of the castle. More importantly, Folossan noted that the chaos of the Art, if it worsened, would lead to the destruction of their castle, as it had been buttressed with magic itself.</p>
