<p>The Giantspire Gap , also called the Giant Gap , was the main pass through the Giantspire Mountains separating Damara and Narfell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While it was the main pass through the mountains, it was more appropriately described as a region of foothills between the taller spurs of the Giantspire Mountains. The Long Road passed through the Gap between Damara to the west and Narfell to the east, though this route was seldom used, owing to marauding monsters and hobgoblins . During the winter, the Gap was completely blocked by snow.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Although treacherous, the Gap was the primary trade route connecting Damaran merchants to the Nar tribes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Gap was claimed by both Damara and Narfell, as well as by Kardobbik , the hobgoblin king of the Giantspires.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, travelers through the Gap were subject both to headhunting raids by the bugbears of the Blood Mountain tribe as well as to paying a toll charged by the goblins of the Razor Heart tribe. The Razor Heart queen, Maaqua , was beleived to have a relationship with Damara that emboldened her "taxation" of the route.</p>
