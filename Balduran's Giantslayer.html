<p>Balduran's Giantslayer was a giant slayer greatsword once wielded by Balduran , the legendary explorer and founder of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blade of the giantslayer was battered down and rough. It featured several serrations and a hooked tip. Its golden crossguard resembled the open maw of a dragon and had, over time, become encrusted with some manner of red, bubbly growth.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Balduran's Giantslayer possessed a +3 enchantment and granted the wielder several boons. It was exceptionally potent against imposing creatures, from those as large as an ogre to those as grand as dragons, and could even knock them down with a successful strike.</p>
<p>Whenever the giantslayer did successfully strike down a foe, the wielder felt a surge of supernatural strength. That strength allowed them to assail large creatures with even greater efficacy.</p>
<p>One or more times per day the wielder of Balduran's Giantslayer could grow in size themselves, for about a minute's duration.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Balduran wielded his giantslayer when he cut down and killed his friend and one-time traveling companion the bronze dragon Ansur .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Balduran's Greatsword remained lodged in the remains of Ansur's corpse, which lay in the depths of the Wyrmway beneath the Wyrm's Rock fortress.</p>
