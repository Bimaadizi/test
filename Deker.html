<p>Deker was a shepherd who lived in the village of Volkumburgh in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , in the month of Uktar some time prior to the Feast of the Moon , Deker was clearing out the ruins known as High Pasture in hopes of constructing a new barn in its place. During this, one of his sheep walked up to and bit a runestick that made it seemingly disappear.</p>
<p>Later a group of adventurers from Suzail , seeking out the scattered remains of Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas , overheard residents gossiping about this incident while in the Crimson Wyrm . They came to inquire with him about it and Deker gladly obliged to show them the runestick .</p>
