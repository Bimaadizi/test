<p>Zebranaurs were a very rare species related to centaurs that had "the upper body of a human and the lower body of a zebra". They were part of a group sometimes called the centaur-kin. Like centaurs, they lived in reclusive tribes of hunter-gatherers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The human portion of a zebranaur was usually brown-skinned, and the zebra portion was white with black stripes. They commonly had a short, coarse mane of black bristles that ran from the middle of the equine back up to the nape of their neck. Most zebranaurs wore the hair on their head in either a distinct spiky style, though some adopted hairstyles used by other local humanoids.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zebranaurs were not strongly inclined towards law or chaos, nor did they take up the causes of good or evil. They were reported to be relatively peaceful.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Zebranaurs typically fought with spears , swords or scimitars , and bows . They were particularly adept with the latter weapon, owing to an ancient bow-hunting tradition. Even when unarmed, zebranaurs could attack opponents with their front hooves.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Zebranaurs were diurnal, omnivorous nomads that lived in temperate plains. They lived in tribes of 50–80 individuals (typically 50% adult males, 30% adult females, and 20% children) led by a single chieftain. Most tribes would have one senior druid or shaman and three or four junior druids and/or shamans. Zebranaur society did not distinguish between males and females. Tribes made temporary camps as they traveled; these camps always had 8–12 adult zebranaurs on guard at all times. They foraged for roots and berries to supplement what small game they hunted. The average lifespan of zebranaurs was 50–60 years.</p>
<p>The only clothing zebranaurs wore was a leather square on their torso, which was fringed and embroidered, and tied at the neck and waist with leather thongs. Individuals wore jewelry of comprised of bone, bright seeds, feathers, and wood; they prized brass and copper jewelry and were known to trade finely-made garments and feathered spears to obtain such ornaments. Zebranaurs never wore armor of any kind.</p>
<p>Zebranaurs were recorded as speaking the Common language as well as a secondary language such as Elvish , Gnoll , Gnome , Goblin (or the hobgoblin dialect thereof), Halfling , or Orc . It was incredibly rare for any zebranaur to be literate in any language. Instead, since they had a near-photographic memory for abstract designs, they painted intricate, whorled patterns on leather to record their history; these were the responsibility of the senior druid.</p>
<p>Most zebranaur tribes had a tradition of painting their upper bodies with vegetable dye to make dark stripes and patterns intended to enhance the natural camouflage of their lower body. They added new markings to their individual designs each year to commemorate achievements, battles, and loves. Some tribes also had a tradition of tattooing their foals during coming-of-age rituals with colorful patterns of blue, red, and orange markings. One tribe in southern Faerûn was said to have developed this into a fine art.</p>
<p>Zebranaurs did not get along with the more aggressive wemics that favored the same temperate plains as them; if a tribe of wemics moved into the same territory as a tribe of zebranaurs, the zebranaurs would normally leave the area.</p>
<p>In certain markets in Calimshan , the lavishly tattooed skin of an adolescent foal's upper back could sell for at least 1,000 gold pieces .</p>
