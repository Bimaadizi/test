<p>Zomara was a drow cleric working with the slaver ring undercover in the Oasis of the White Palm in Raurin in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zomara rested in a room underneath the Sandvoyagers' Guild , inside a ruin known as the Temple of Set . She had a weighed net at the entrance, and kept eight spiders as servants.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Zomara had a mace , chain mail , and a small shield ; all of these were very powerfully enchanted. She wore boots of elvenkind and a cloak of elvenkind , which eased her avoidance of fire-based attacks. All of her equipment would become useless if exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>Inside her pillow, Zomara kept ten gems , each of which was worth 50 gold pieces , five gems worth 100 gp, and one gem worth 5000 gp.</p>
