<h2>History</h2>
<p>Frederick Maxillian was the mastermind behind the ruse that kept the lycanthrope Maxillian clan in secret for over a century after his death. He build the Chase Maze under the Maxillian Manor to sate the family's bloodlust and hunting instincts at night, and working the fiends and orchards by day to support themselves financially. The family learned to drug and trap stray travelers and adventurers in the Maze, letting the family members track and rip the farm's "guests" apart.</p>
