<p>Nayan was a leader of the Shadowmasters of Telflamm in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , after Mask stopped answering their prayers, Nayan led a small band of Shadowmasters to find the First and Second Chosen of Mask in order to receive a sign of the god. They found Drasek Riven and waited until the arrival of Erevis Cale . When the two Chosen met Nayan and his companions, they sensed the will of Mask at work and agreed to help their mission to infiltrate the Hole prison in Yhaunn .</p>
<p>The mission was successful despite the sacrifice of one of Nayan's companions. Cale instructed Nayan to take Endren Corrinthal back to his son Abelar Corrinthal . Nayan did so, then tried to hire Nayan and his men to fight in the Sembian Civil War but Nayan dismissed the offer, saying he only fought for his god. During the fighting against Kesson Rel , Nayan and all his companions, beside Vyrhas , were empowered by Erevis Cale in order to fight better in the upcoming battle.</p>
