<p>Lightning was an ironically named black gelding horse because it was docile enough to let the saurial hero Dragonbait handle it circa 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , companions of the hero Alias purchased Lightning, along with other horses from Dimswart Manor in Cormyr .</p>
<p>Lightning was a pack horse and was purchased especially for its calm demeanor, letting Dragonbait ride it, unlike all other mounts available. Dragonbait rode the horse to Suzail , the Shadow Gap , Shadowdale , and Yulash , where the heroes were forced to abandon their mounts while pursuing the Abomination of Moander through Cormanthor .</p>
