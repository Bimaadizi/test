<p>Rassalantar was a hamlet and caravan stop on the Long Road , just north of Waterdeep in the Sword Coast North region.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The small community consisted of six walled farms. They centered around a spring-fed pond which drained into a stream and emptied to the east into the Stump Bog , a sprawling, desolate marsh haunted by monsters. To the west of the farmhouses, a narrow patch of trees known as Keep Woods masked the ruins of Rassalantar's Keep, and to the east of the pond was the Sleeping Dragon .</p>

<h2>Defense</h2>
<p>Since Rassalantar was under Waterdeep's protection, sixty guards were stationed in the barracks just off the road behind the Sleeping Dragon inn. The fighters were outfitted in chain mail with shields and fought with spears , longswords , hammers , and daggers . The Waterdhavian soldiers patrolled the Long Road from the gates of their city to a cavern a half-days ride north of Amphail. The guards were rotated back to duty in Castle Waterdeep once a month. The officers, on the other hand, do not rotate, because they were veterans who knew the surrounding country very well. The local civilar or captain was Gheldarm Tassor and she was assisted by two armars or sergeants, Blaskos Ulraven and Timmer Longschal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long ago, the warrior Rassalantar built Rassalantar's Keep to the west of the present settlement. The ruined keep was used by traveling vagabonds, doppelgangers , and hungry monsters as a place of shelter. In 1370 DR , the hamlet of Rassalantar was under the protection of Waterdeep with guards patrolling as far north as half a day beyond Amphail .</p>
