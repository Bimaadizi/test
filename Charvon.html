<p>Charvon was a soldier and commander among the centaurs of Guard in Bloodstone Barony in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Gareth Dragonsbane and his party first arrived in Bloodstone Pass in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Charvon was the commander of Guard's cavalry "legion," a force of 160 centaurs armed with clubs . The legion gladly fought alongside Dragonsbane and the forces of Bloodstone Village to repel an invasion of the Pass by the Duchy of Arcata in the first battle of the Bloodstone Wars , but subsequently expected a share of the wealth flowing from Bloodstone Mines before joining his campaign southward. This was despite Charvon's inability or unwillingness to help liberate the mines during the prior winter.</p>
