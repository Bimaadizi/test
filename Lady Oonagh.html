<p>Lady Oonagh was an elven noblewoman and an adventurer from the Forest of Tethir , active sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lady Oonagh hailed from a musically-inclined noble elven family, but unlike them, Oonagh had no musical talent and was a particularly bad singer. She often adventured with her companion and lover Lord Alex . Lady's long-time mate one year presented her with a gag birthday gift, the enchanted lute , later known as Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute . Alex found it appropriate that the lute and Oonagh's voice both sounded so terrible and intense, they caused profuse ear bleeding.</p>
