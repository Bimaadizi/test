<p>The Academy of Mentalist Study was a famous magic school in Eileanar that operated for the entire lifetime of the enclave.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The college focused on the magic of the mentalist field. Just before Karsus's Folly , the Dean of Teachers, Zucchi , taught alongside a body of teachers who each specialized in a particular area. They were made up of Czarnieck (mind control), Flaugergues ( illusions ), Lycanter ( telepathy ), Siculus (illusions), Addington ( divination ), Midoria (information gathering), Grenoble (divination), and Alexander ( necromancy ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Academy was founded by Karsus as part of the grand opening of his enclave in 3185 NY (−674 DR) , with the intention of drawing people in to populate his new city.</p>
<p>The most famous student was the arcanist Shadow , who produced a revolutionary and outrageous piece of work that accurately detailed the mechanics of the planes and demiplanes . When it became known that he had studied at the Academy the student body increased by 30% for the next five years, and the college added another two levels to the main structure in addition to purchasing the neighboring block in order to build dormitories.</p>
