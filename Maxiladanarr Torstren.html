<p>Maxiladanarr Torstren was the Magister from 1322 DR to 1328 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Of average height, Maxiladanarr's hair was always unruly. He had a weathered face and sharp eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He viewed wizards' duels as wasteful.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maxiladanarr had explored much of Faerûn by both expedition and through magical scrying. He became the Magister after slaying two Red Wizards who summoned monsters to savage Ulraen of Eltabbar , after he slew Veldribold of Calimport , who had slain the previous Magister. His first act was to blast apart his own tower; he always hid both his magic and himself afterwards, making many believe he was actually dead. He traveled often by gates, and did not take a home again, working against the clock in expectation that some young upstart would catch up to him and take the mantle away. His main project was the breeding of a number of clans, akin to the project of another previous archmage, Olohmber Starnardyn .</p>
<p>Maxiladanarr covertly manipulated them into arranged marriages, and let a profusion of magical scrolls find their way to these new clan members. He ultimately perished in an avalanche.</p>
