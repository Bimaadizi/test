<p>The Redrun was a stream located in the Ten Towns region of Icewind Dale . It drained water from Lac Dinneshere and carried over to Redwaters lake.</p>
<p>It was a common destination for fishermen who preferred to stay off boats.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>During most of the year, the Redrun was little more than a steady stream. When the ice from Kelvin's Cairn melted in the spring, the rush of fresh ice water transformed it into raging whitewater rapids.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , two fishermen traveling along the Redrun disappeared within the span of two tendays .</p>
