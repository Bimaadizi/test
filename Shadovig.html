<p>Shadovigs were minute fey that were thought to have been corrupted by the Shadow Weave .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shadovigs resembled wingless, 9‑inch-tall (0.23‑meter) pixies . They had grey skin, clawed fingers, and veiled eyes. They typically wore black leather armor that appeared to be made entirely from belts and straps.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shadovigs were more dangerous in darkness than in light. All spoke the Common and Sylvan languages, and some learned Loross as well. Naturally, they had darkvision .</p>
<p>Shadovigs had a few spell-like abilities, being able to replicate the effects of the spells invisibility and mirror image three times each day.</p>
<p>Shadovigs were good melee fighters, having poisonous claws. They were fond of sneak attacks when their opponents were caught off-guard. Additionally, they themselves were difficult to catch flat-footed, being able to react to attacks faster than their senses alone permitted.</p>
<p>However, shadovigs were more powerful and dangerous in the shadows. While in darkness, they were faster, harder to hit with attacks, more perceptive, more stealthy, and just generally more competent.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shadovigs preferred to avoid direct combat, instead attacking from the shadows.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Shadovigs were wicked creatures, said to have been sprites that were corrupted by the power of the Shadow Weave , possibly with the assistance of Mask or Shar . They were known to work as thieves, assassins, and spies, either as servants for others or masters themselves. Some shadovigs acted as familiars to shade arcanists .</p>
