<p>Ilyber Kitcher was the infamous would-be explorer of uncharted jungles of Chult , hailing from Scardale , who perished several centuries before 1362 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ilyber Kitcher's likeness was preserved in stone and was known as Kitcher's Folly . The unwitting explorer had a stern and unpleasant expression on his face, stern eyes, bushy eyebrows. His tight thin lips were decorated with long mustache.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ilyber Kitcher was atrocious at navigation, which was evident from his missing the Bay of Chult , sailing along Chult's eastern coast, getting lost, and if not for a serendipitous storm that threw his ship to the Refugee Bay and into Kitcher's Inlet .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several centuries before 1362 DR, a pompous and overly ambitious nobleman explorer from Scardale, Sir Ilyber Kitcher arrived in Chult. Financed by his rich uncle Castigliar , Ilyber embarked on uncovering unmapped Chultan lands and planned to erect a series of enchanted monuments to commemorate his future glorious achievements. He planned to place these busts on the sites of his discoveries and illustrious battles and enchant them to recite the tales of Sir Kitcher's achievements and inform travelers about local flora and fauna and survival tips.</p>
<p>Kitcher spent some time in Chult and even named Kitcher's Inlet after himself, which was a smaller part of the Refugee Bay, as well as a plot of the beach after his uncle - Port Castigliar . The "discovery" of Kitcher's Inlet happened upon Ilyber's initial arrival in Chult. Even though inlet's existence was known before the nobleman claimed its name on the maps.</p>
<p>In the end, Kitcher's career ended quickly. The ignorant explorer stumbled upon a violent confrontation between two local tribes. With his common sense blinded by his own sense of supremacy over the "savages," Ilyber commanded his wizard to create a display of power for the tribesmen. Sir Kitcher thought to heroically resolve whatever conflict he came across. Instead, both warring tribes found a common enemy and descended on the new and evident threat with a barrage of spears .</p>
<p>Thankfully for Ilyber Kitcher's legacy, some of his hirings survived the attack and fled, bringing the story of the explorer's death and his few discoveries back to Scardale. His uncle, thankful for a plot of land named after him, paid a group of adventurers to sneak into the jungle and erect one monument that came to be infamous for its namesake's history, Kitcher's Folly.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Kitcher's Folly, was believed by superstitious Tabaxi tribesmen to be a petrified evil giant , buried chest-deep in the ground by Ubtao as a warning to keep outlanders away from the jungle.</p>
