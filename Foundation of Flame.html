<p>The Foundation of Flame was a pair of magic boots crafted by Havilar for her twin sister Farideh in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As the wearer of boots walked, the Foundation of Flame created an illusion akin to a heat shimmer around the wearer, making it harder for their enemies to target them accurately. The effect was so potent at misleading onlookers that its power was likened to that of a mass suggestion spell.</p>
