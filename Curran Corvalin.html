<p>Curran Corvalin was a halfling in the Doomvault dungeon in 1486 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Curran never considered himself a chosen since he had no powers. He only thought he had very good luck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Curran once lived in Baldur's Gate until he casually found the treasure of a deceased relative, he won a bet, he had some investments come through, and he found a chest of jewels that someone had lost all in the same day. This convinced Curran to devote himself to Tymora and relocate to Daggerford .
In town Curran took care of the Fairfortune Hall as priest of Tymora and was in with good relations with the duke and other influential citizens.</p>
<p>In 1485 DR , he met some adventurers recruited to stop a menace to the duchy.</p>
<p>In 1486 DR , Curran was captured by the Red Wizards of Thay , who identified him as a Chosen of Tymora , and transported him to the Doomvault dungeon for experiments. A few weeks later he was freed from his chains by the heroes of Daggerford: some of the adventurers he had met and others. Thanks to them, he returned to Daggerford.</p>
