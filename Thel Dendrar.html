<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , the local bandits of Phandalin gave sly and suggestive looks to Mirna, Thel's wife. The Redbrands had been terrorizing the village for some time, and the townmaster, Harbin Wester , was too intimidated to do anything. Thus, Thel approached the bandits alone in this cause. This did not go well, and he was murdered.</p>
<p>Thel's corpse and his family were taken to Tresendar Manor , the ruffians' base. Thel was thrown into the caverns beneath the manor and fed to a nothic , whilst his family were put into a slave pen.</p>
