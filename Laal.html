<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laal lived with her companion Xol in the Underdark below Earthspur Mountains .
In 1491 DR , Xol noticed a group of troglodytes moving to the sewers of Mulmaster . He convinced Laal to follow them in order to warn others about this menace. While following the troglodytes, Xol singled out the mind of a particularly evil human . Xol tried to follow this man but was killed in an ambush. His body fell into the sewers and ended up being carried to the surface where it was discovered by some children. Laal tried to mentally contact first one of the children and afterwards the adventurer Florio but with little success. At this point, Laal was attacked by some lacedons , but an adventuring party hired by the city watch sergeant Audra Maskyr then arrived. They had been sent to investigate the appearance of Xol's body.</p>
