<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1054 DR, Ce'Nedra rained death and destruction on the small dwarven village of Stonejewel , located at the entrance to the Stronghold of Uziul in Citadel Felbarr. The woman cast fireballs and lightning bolts on the dwarves. But one of the warriors stood against the sorceressâ€” Arokin Steelarm . He lunged at her and managed to snatch Ce'Nedra's medallion off her neck before being defeated and left for dead. Unbeknownst to her, Arokin survived and set out to stop the evil creature.</p>
<p>Some time later, before 1360 DR , Ce'Nedra sought to gain the power hidden deep within the mysteriously manifested great pyramid of Anauroch . In order to gain access to the ancient structure, she took shape of a sand golem and slaughtered the Bedine tribe that resided in the Oasis of Ma'atar . She slew the leader's son - Rahmed , the leader's wife, and tortured the old man, leaving him crucified, slowly dying in the Anauroch's sun.</p>
<p>Even though not much was known of the outcome of Ce'Nedra's quest, she gained entrance to the guarded chambers within the great pyramid while being pursued by adventurers Arokin Steelarm, Aileen , Gwidre , and Farad'n - the son of the Bedine tribe leader the sorceress tortured to death.</p>
