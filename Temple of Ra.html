<p>The Temple of Ra was an abandoned temple to Ra in the city of Medinat Muskawoon . Martek enchanted it to serve as the hiding place for the Star of Melos-Pelar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple of Ra lay southwest of the banks of the Me'at Halwa, approximately 300 feet away.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple's entrance was flanked by two great pylons of red stone which bore gigantic depictions of eyes. Beyond the entrance, a colonnade was visible, which delimitated a courtyard; each pillar was topped by a blossom with many petals. The far wall of the court was topped by columns much larger than those of the colonnade, holding up the temple roof; in the midle of the far wall, a wide portico opened into the entry hall. The pillars, and the dint of the portico, were green stone; the stone of the wall was pink, while the blossoms were rendered in black stone.</p>
<p>Past the entrance lay an entry hall, somewhat cool and dark compared to outside. It was 60 ft (18 m) by 30 ft (9.1 m), with a 10 ft (3 m) wide and 20 ft (6.1 m) tall doorway in the center of the far wall; the stone arch was black marble, fully five feet thick, joining seamlessly with the darkness beyond.</p>
<p>Crossing the final doorway led to a zone where the floor had been replaced by a bottomless, churning void. An altar lay in the middle of that room, holding the Star of Melos-Pelar.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The temple was thick with Martek's enchantments, and no magic other than that of his' could be counted on there. The Eyes of Hathor would freeze anyone who approached the temple to recover the Star Gem of Melos-Pelar, the courtyard would fill with snakes that would only be repelled with the flame from the Temple of Prometheus; the entry hall's mist would charm anyone who did not fly over it with Horus' gift, and the void around the altar would be best bypassed with the enchanted golden drainage grates from the baths around the city of Medinat Muskawoon. If all fourteen were collected and used to make a bridge, however, the last one would disappear, echoing the legend of Isis and Osiris fleeing Set .</p>
