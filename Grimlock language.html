<p>The grimlock language was the spoken language seemingly unique to grimlocks , a species of underground-dwelling humanoids that isolated themselves from other races in the Underdark . It was technically a dialect of two other languages common among subterranean beings, Terran and Undercommon .</p>
<p>The parent languages of the grimlock dialect were commonly spoken throughout Fingerhome , an expansive series of caves the grimlock race regarded as their home.</p>
