<p>Tagarath was a village in far eastern Tethyr circa the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This village was located on the Tethir Road between Riatavin and the Vilhon Reach at the ford across the Shining Stream . The river was the traditional boundary between County Valashar and County Morninggold .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Tagarath was ruled by a crownar (the equivalent of a mayor) and a council of local merchants. As of 1480 DR, the crownar was Orth Haelen and the council had eight members. However, throughout the 1470s, Orth's daughter Alaya had assumed control of the day-to-day responsibilities of the crownar because her father was aging and in poor health. Laws were enforced by the Riders, a small local police force, and the crownar employed a dozen or so "watchers" (spies) and agents. Being a very small town, the watchers were seven elderly and nosy women and the agents were Alaya's two younger sisters and her three suitors. There were also tax collectors that made their rounds holding the leashes of trained war dogs .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Tagarath was well situated on a major trade route and had the typical services for merchants and caravans passing through. Agents of the Zhentarim or other tyrannical merchant organizations were unwelcome in Tagarath and were surreptitiously killed by the crownar's agents when identified.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The only official entity defending Tagarath was the Riders. The town benefited from being part of either Valashar or Morninggold, and perhaps the baronies of Carrelath and Impresk that had patrols and garrisons in the region.</p>
