<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Moondeep Sea was located in the Upperdark . The cavern which contained it was known as the Vault of Gnashing Teeth , so named for the countless animated skulls stuck to the cavern's ceiling. The water of the lake was fed from the Great Glacier .</p>
<p>The lake was surrounded by a confusing network of tunnels and caverns known as the "Lost Ways," remnants of the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Sarphil . These passages wound beneath the lake and deeper into the Underdark.</p>
<p>The lake was magically connected to the Moonsea so that moonlight hitting it would be reflected on the surface of its Underdark counterpart.</p>
<p>The city of V'elddrinnsshar‎ lay on a mile-wide island dominated by a plateau in the middle of the lake.</p>
<h3>Flora and Fauna</h3>
<p>The Moondeep Sea was known for its giant water spiders .</p>
