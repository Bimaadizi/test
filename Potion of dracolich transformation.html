<p>Potions of dracolich transformation were magical potions consumed by dragons as a part of the process of becoming undead dracoliches , created by the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Potions of dracolich transformation were an integral part of the process to transform a living wyrm into a dracolich. The exact composition of each position varied and was prepared for each individual dragon separately using a wide selection of ingredients, depending on the age and type of the dragon. All variants, however, were brewed using seven arcane ingredients that included vampire blood , a potion of evil dragon control , a potion of invulnerability , and the ichor of a ghost .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The potion was imbibed after the future dracolich's phylactery prepared. This concoction was poisonous to any other creatures but dragons. The lethality of the potion was severe, making survival extremely unlikely.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>In order to prepare a serving of this potion, a spellcaster needed to assemble all the required ingredients and use the animate dead spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This potion was used in turning Pelendralaar into his undead form sometime before 1369 DR . During the Cult of the Dragon's occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor , Kya Mordrayn 's lieutenants prepared another serving of the potion, presumably to transform Pelendralaar's daughter Palasiraks at a later date.</p>
