<p>Hisssta was a major port of the planet Coliar in Realmspace , one of only about 50 such trading posts scattered throughout that truly massive planet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hisssta was a lizardfolk spelljamming port. Like all land masses within the atmosphere of Coliar, Hisssta was a floating island, one of many thousands.</p>
<p>The port contained several structures. A stream flowed through the town and poured off the edge to fall to unfathomable depths.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The lizardfolk of Coliar maintained primitive communistic governments. On Hisssta, that government's business was centralized at the Hall of the People.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Hisssta charged a moorage fee of 90 gold pieces and an air tax of 40 gold pieces. This was an exorbitant tax compared to the average 5-gold-piece air tax imposed at other lizarfolk ports within the planet. An additional cargo tax was also charged, which was based on the amount of cargo being carried by mooring spelljammers .</p>
<p>The communal government maintained a publicly owned warehouse where off-world trade deals were arranged and goods were purchased, sold, and stored.</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>The islanders of Hisssta were known to revere the god Semuanya , and the port contained at least one temple dedicated to him.</p>
