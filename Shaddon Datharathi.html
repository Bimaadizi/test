<p>Shaddon Datharathi was the patriarch of the Datharathi family in 1374 DR and the inventor of plangents . He became a thrall of Pandorym while improving on them.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Shaddon had grafted his entire body, effectively replacing his skin, with plangent crystal. He had muscles and bone visible, but only one eye remained natural. He clothed himself fully in ornate golden robes, with a stiff collar, cape, and silken gloves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shaddon was the wizard who built Warian Datharathi 's prosthetic in 1367 DR ; he later improved the process, developing the plangents. In his own words, he was the most accomplished mage that the family had ever produced. He continued to improve on them, and starting on 1372 DR he gained the power to possess, both spying on and controlling, any plangent in Vaelan , unfortunately discovering his own transformation into a plangent had made him a thrall to Pandorym in the process, as he used plangent mined directly from the elder evil's prison within the Celestial Nadir . Few suspected of his activities, but Zeltaebar Datharathi had come to suspect that something was controlling Xaemar Datharathi and other plangents. In fact, his son Xaemar had become his favourite puppet.</p>
<p>When Warian Datharathi returned to Vaelan, he insisted, through Xaemar, that the man come see him immediately. On arrival the patriarch attempted to remove his grandson's prosthetic by force after an initial refusal; Zeltaebar knocked him out using a crowbar, which prompted him to attack them using Sevaera Datharathi and several plangent spiders as proxies. Later, as his grand-daughter Eined Datharathi arrived together with Iahn Qoyllor and Ususi Manaallin , he'd attack them too, killing Eined; they'd paralyze him and escape.</p>
<p>Shaddon Datharathi was finally slain in the Imperial Weapons Cache of the Palace of the Purple Emperor by the elf Kiril Duskmourn , on Tarsakh 19 of 1374 DR .</p>
