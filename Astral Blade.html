<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to his own claims, the bard named Leldor recovered the artifact Astral Blade from the ruins of Northkeep on the southern shores of the Moonsea . Despite his claims, he never could offer evidence of the sword ever existing. His story stated that after the Astral Blade was recovered, the ghosts of the ruins's original defenders approached him as he slumbered late at night. They said that the weapon belonged to the Lady of the North . When Leldor asked who this mysterious woman was, a beautiful apparition presented herself to the bard, immediately making him fall in love with the Lady and returning her sword.</p>
<p>More common versions of Astral Blade with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
