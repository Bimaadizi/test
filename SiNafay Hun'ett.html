<p>Si Nafay Hun'ett was the Matron Mother of House Hun'ett in Menzoberranzan in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thinking House Do'Urden posed a threat, she found an opportunity in the discovery that Alton De Vir had escaped Gelroos Hun'ett 's assassination attempt and taken his guise. She would later reveal she gave Gelroos approval, but did not discover his failure until years later. She used this pretext to present Alton to a gathering of Matriarchs and to challenge House Do'Urden's incomplete eradication of House De Vir. She tasked Masoj Hun'ett into killing Drizzt Do'Urden , but had Alton follow him to make sure the task was done. They both failed and died. With Drizzt abandoning his House, for ten years, the two Houses were in a covert war with no noble casualties. Lloth grew displeases and ordered the war must be over in a final battle, regardless of the winner. House Hun'ett attacked the Do'Urden compound, but with Jarlaxle accepting a desperate Matron Mother Malice Do'Urden 's offer, House Hun'ett was defeated and punished by the ruling council of Menzoberranzan , with all her offspring slain, as well as most of her commoners.</p>
<p>After that, Matron Hun'ett became a member of House Do'Urden under a new name, Shi'nayne Do'Urden .</p>
<p>She was later tricked and sacrificed to Lolth by Matron Malice for the Zin-carla ritual to resurrect Zaknafein Do'Urden in the Year of the Wanderer, 1338 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was particularly diminutive, even by drow standards, standing just over four feet tall.</p>
