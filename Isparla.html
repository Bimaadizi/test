<p>Isparla "Serpenthips" was the leader of the Moonclaws band of thieves in Hastarl , and later concubine to King Belaur Aumar , during the early 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Her beauty and allure were notorious.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As leader of the Moonclaws, Isparla was notoriously impatient and bloodthirsty, feared mostly by her own comrades due to her sadism, cruelty, and madness.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Isparla was the leader of the Moonclaws , and later, a concubine to King Belaur Aumar . She had a special regard for Storntil among her gang members.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Isparla had strung up a man by his feet, whipped him to death, and drank the blood laughing, which was a notable event for the rest of the gang.</p>
<p>After the Velvet Hands thieves' guild attempted to ambush the Moonclaws at the gates of Athalgard in response for the Moonclaws' killing of several of their members, the fleeing thieves were pursued by numerous forces of both the Magelords of Athalantar and the Moonclaws, culminating in a small team led by Isparla personally. After escaping, the sole survivor, Eladar the Dark, who was actually Prince Elminster Aumar , drew her into an ambush at a warehouse by slaying one of her largest bodyguards. At the warehouse, after a number of her people entered, the rest decided to set it on fire rather than keep walking into the ambush. She did not have them go in to rescue their wounded. Elminster escaped from the fire, set her house ablaze in response, and then followed them to the Roost of the Moonclaws, a bath-house they used as their own hideout. Before they were able to eliminate Eladar, the Magister , Dorgon Heamilothoar , interfered, and cast a spell that allowed Eladar to escape.</p>
<p>She was one of the thieves who broke into the bedroom of Peeryst Trumpettower and Nanue Glarneir on the night of their marriage, which led to a rather confusing tussle between them, Perrigo Trumpettower , and a rival band of thieves, the Velvet Hands .</p>
<p>By 240Â DR , Isparla was no longer leader of the Moonclaws, and had instead become a concubine to King Belaur. In the aftermath of Hastarl's conquest by Elminster Aumar , she participated in the festivities, dancing with Helm Stoneblade .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Farl believed someone must've pulled her out of the Trumpettower bridal suite afterwards, as she'd gotten knocked out during the burglary.</p>
