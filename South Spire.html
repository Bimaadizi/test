<p>South Spire was the mage tower of Thessamel Arunder .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Thessamel Arunder 's apprentice, Faeya , signed off on the sale of his tower to a cabal of merchants in exchange for 200,000 gp , a promise to remain unmolested, free firewood, and a dozen deer a year. Thessamel was initially outraged, until Faeya reminded him that the wild magic spreading throughout Faerûn at the time was now public knowledge, and that she'd had to stab two old rivals of his to death. Thessamel also learned that Barundryn Harbright , a warrior he'd met at a feast in Felmorel , was now his tenant.</p>
