<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Shadow Over Wheloon</h3>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Oriphaun decided to become an adventurer, to his uncle Belvedere 's disapproval. An aspiring relic collector, he was roaming about Cormyr hunting for rare artifacts when he first laid eyes on a Nether Scroll in the Storm Horns . In his whimsy, he considered it to be a suitable trinket to add to his collection, though he did not manage to actually obtain it at the time and it was instead taken by the forces of Thultanthar , who were also in the area secretly recovering an intact mythallar . His uncle, along with the footman Antone Corluk , traveled to Eveningstar in search of adventurers to bring Oriphaun home, or at least ensure his survival.</p>
<p>After checking with Oversword Edric Crastmere , Oriphaun slipped into the prison city—unbeknownst to both the Shadovar and the Purple Dragons —seeking thrills and interesting trinkets, having bribed the lizardfolk of the underground tunnels to smuggle him in. Unwittingly discovering the Netherese in the process of their invasion , he knew that his duty demanded that he put the good of the realm ahead of his pleasures, and so devoted his efforts towards uncovering how the Shadovar had entered the city and what they hoped to achieve there. Discovering that they had a Nether Scroll in their possession and were using it to gather an army to strike at Cormyr through the Shadowfell , he prepared to steal it from Oldstone Hall when adventurers sent by the Wizard of War Jacinta Last found him at the entrance.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion with the Cormyrean agents about the situation, Oriphaun climbed up the outside of the structure and planned to sneak in through a window where the archwizard Tyvrus kept the Scroll , while Cormyr's forces fought through the manor, in part using the gossamer-thin Shadowfell border to overcome the defenders. The agents arrived at the top of Oldstone Hall's tower only to find Oriphaun already there, frozen in place by Tyvrus's magic and the Nether Scroll in his hand. After a grueling fight with the arcanist in both material and shadow realms, Tyvrus was slain and the Shadowfell Nexus collapsed, ending the Shadowfell connection to Wheloon and stranding the remaining Netherese forces inside the city. Without a moment to waste, Oriphaun took the Scroll away from the city in order to hide it from its former owners.</p>
<h3>The High Road of Shadows</h3>
<p>Oriphaun fled the scene in Tyvrus's tower as soon as he had the Nether Scroll , knowing that he would be pursued to the death by the agents of Netheril. He managed to make contact with the Harpers and was quickly initiated into the group, then vanished once more into the wilderness. In an attempt to buy time before the shades of Thultanthar recovered the Scroll , or at least prevent them from getting the whole thing, he tore it into several pieces and hid them in various places along the High Road between Eveningstar and Tyrluk , hoping that his Harper allies could muster their forces in time to stop the Netherese properly. With his part done to the best of his ability, Oriphaun moved on as quickly as possible to return to the Storm Horns, where he overcame a Shadovar spellcaster and captured their staff . Realizing that the staff was a powerful and dangerous artifact, Oriphaun dropped it off with his friend Halsaime while he pursued his investigations.</p>
<h3>The Secret of the Storm Horns</h3>
<p>Oriphaun went on to discover a Netherese plot to raise a flying enclave from a mountain glacier in the Storm Horns, using the the power of an unearthed mythallar , and sent an urgent request to the Harpers for backup to meet him in the Yarrow Glade . However, when the adventurers met with him they were ambushed by Netherese forces led by Archwizard Amskar , who captured Oriphaun and brought him to the glacier. Oriphaun was later found and freed by the adventurers as the grand scheme reached its completion. Though they were unable to prevent Amskar from reactivating the mythallar and raising the glacier, they broke the enclave's flight pillars and killed Amskar before jumping off as the enclave flew out of control and smashed into a mountainside, ending the Netherese invasion plans. After the successful thwarting of the Netherese conspiracies, Oriphaun returned safely to his family.</p>
