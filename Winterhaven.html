<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the birth of Cormyr in 26 DR , the shadow dragon Shadraxil lurked in the Thunder Peaks. When Cormyr began to create a series of fortresses along its frontier in 236 DR , Shadraxil took this as an affront to his lands and began attacking the outposts. In response to Shadraxil's depredations, Cormyr sent a small force of armed men and War Wizards led by the paladin Jerold Keegan . Keegan created a magical trap within one of the keeps and trapped Shadraxil in the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<p>Sir Jerold Keegan became the lord of that outpost, which was then called Keegan's Keep. The town of Winterhaven was founded nearby due to the keep's protection.</p>
<p>It is said that some time after Shadraxil's banishment, Keegan became a crazed madman and slew all of his family and friends, cursing the keep forever. The leaders of Cormyr, afraid that this dark influence could be corrupting, ordered the keep torn down. They slew a young shadow dragon, claimed it was Shadraxil's corpse, and buried in a fake dragon burial site southwest of Winterhaven</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , a cult of Shar was established in Winterhaven. While the founder Kalarel and the leader Bairwin Wildarson were killed at the hands of adventurers, rumors persisted that not all the cultists were routed.</p>
