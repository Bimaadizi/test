<p>Warrior Vu'un was a githyanki sentry who guarded the hatchery of Crèche Y'llek on Toril in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vu'un had typical yellow leathery skin of his race and an elongated face. He was adorned in a githyanki half-plate and wore a helmet of the same design.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warrior Vu'un, along with other gith of what would become Crèche Y'llek, attacked and claimed the Rosymorn Monastery of Lathander in the Western Heartlands sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Soon after, the function of Crèche was changed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. During that time, warrior Vu'un stood guard in the Crèche's hatchery and its youths' caretaker Varsh Ko'kuu . Vu'un did not trust istik , but respected them being allowed into the Crèche. Under Vu'un's watchful eyes, outsiders were not allowed near githyanki eggs.</p>
