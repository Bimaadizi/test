<p>Ioulaum Industries was a Netherese company that was responsible for the research and creation of mythallars , and had locations in Eileanar and other enclaves .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Ioulaum himself had little input on his business, as he was personally focused on his longevity spell , the threat of the phaerimms , and various other magical studies. He occasionally visited his Karsus Enclave branch in order to pick up a specialized magical component or chatting with the site administrator Ghazzalee , who oversaw the other managers. Fabbra was responsible for finding and verifying potential customers, ensuring that they could both pay the high prices and weren't a threat to Netheril . Ryckaert headed the research-and-development team, which largely involved guiding the various magical misfits, eccentrics, and lunatics through mythallar -related projects. Finally, Theobald was in charge of transporting finished products to customers, which required extremely experienced and trustworthy guards to oversee shipments until they reached their destination.</p>
