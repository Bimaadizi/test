<p>Utu was the Untheric god of the sun . His manifestation on Toril was killed during the Orcgate Wars . His symbol was a sun disc.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Utu manifested as a human male bathed in dazzling golden light that destroyed undead . Any non-indestructible object that touched his body would melt. Contact with any heat above 100 degrees Fahrenheit would instantly heal all of his wounds. He had the power to transform living matter into soil. In battle, he flung bits of the sun at his opponents, up to two miles away.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Utu presumably came to Toril with the other Untheric deities aboard the Galley of the Gods . He was killed by one of the orcish gods in −1071 DR , and his body was laid to rest in a God-Tomb in Unther .</p>
<p>Utu's outer planar self was once close to his fellow power Enki and resided like him on Mechanus despite his chaotic nature. After Enki's murder, Utu moved to Arborea and for the most part withdrew into his realm.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>In the Great Wheel cosmology Utu maintained a realm named the Absorbing Light on Arvandor , Arborea 's first layer. Noone knew what it was like, however, as no explorers returned from there. It was rumored that any visitors were forcefully merged with chaotic Utu - as opposed to only the most prepared petitioners as was the norm - causing the deity to become more mentally unstable through the effort to integrate divergent minds.</p>
<p>In the World Tree cosmology , the Untheric pantheon including Utu resided on their plane of Zigguraxus .</p>
