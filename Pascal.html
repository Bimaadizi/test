<p>Pascal was slimy rogue inhabiting the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He owned a boarding house called Pascal's Tenements that was widely used by Daggerford's underworld to avoid the attention from the militia. Pascal himself was believed to live outside of the city, but that was only because no one ever saw him coming or going from his building. His boarding house was located at the intersection of Duke's Way and the Farmer's Road in central Daggerford.</p>
