<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anukiru made a name for himself by being a master weapon maker. His fame stretched across the entire Kozakura.

Anukiru eventually finished his masterpiece â€“ Steel Blossom . The swordsmith immediately fell in love with his creation and refused to hand it over to the Shogun. Infuriated, the Shogun beheaded Anukiru with Steel Blossom .
