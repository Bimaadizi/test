<p>The Harbor Ward of Port Nyanzaru housed the majority of city's docks, including those used by its merchant princes . It was a busy place where ships were loaded and unloaded, allowing for goods to flow in and out of the port.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Harbor Ward lay along the harbor on the northside of the city. The Ward sat between the Merchants' Ward to the west and the Market Ward to the east. A network of caves, said to contain an old temple to Umberlee , lay beneath the streets of the ward.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The harbor itself was built to be highly defensible against pirates, and featured a defensive chain that could be raised to block entrance or exit to the harbor. The harbor's lighthouse that could be used to send smoke signals which could be seen all across the Bay of Chult .</p>
<p>The Dock Ward bustled with dinosaurs and dockhands ready to help load and unload ships, notably with the aid of dinosaur-powered cranes , and was filled with the sounds of splashing waves, creaking ropes , and barrels rolling across the cobblestone streets. While most of the docks were freely available for use by ships of all sizes, an enclosed portion of the docks at one end of the Ward—known as the " Royal Docks "—was reserved for use by the city's merchant princes as well as any visiting dignitaries or influential merchants whom the Princes wished to impress or treat as honored guests. Between the Royal Docks and the public docks was a drydock and the Warehouse District .</p>
<p>During heavy rains, runoff from the ravine of Malar's Throat would stream into the city and empty into the harbor, often carrying with it baskets , dead animals, and sometimes an unlucky person.</p>
