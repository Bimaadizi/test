<p>Hands of Tyr were specialty priests of the Church of Tyr who were tasked with tracking down wrong-doers.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hands would sometimes dispense the appropriate form of justice upon capturing their targets if a magisterial system was not in place at their current location. However, a hand would never break any laws or harm innocents in order to capture their targets. A hand would make it a priority to track down any criminal they apprehended who escaped justice after being delivered to authorities by the hand.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Though they behaved more like paladins , hands were still a part of Tyr 's clergy. They viewed themselves as pure and invincible instruments of law, and in many ways they were exactly that. They held to the creed "thou shalt not get away with it." Hands were always human .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hands could detect evil up to 60 feet (18 meters) away at will. They could handle items from crime scenes to find the path of an escaped criminal.</p>
<p>A hand would be negatively affected the longer they went without capturing a fugitive that they had caught and delivered to authorities previously.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>They wore white plate mail with full helmets . A white and gold tabard embroidered with Tyr's symbol covered their chest. They never carried a shield . A hands preferred weapon was a warhammer .</p>
