<p>Nibulus Loral was a scholar and a sage who spent his later years studying the natural life in Cormyr during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He spent much of his life as a wizard by trade, helping others by enchanting weapons and protecting them from monstrous beasts. As he slowed down in his golden years, he gained an appreciation for the simple joys of life, especially taking a newfound regard for the varied species of nature. He traveled around Cormyr and began to record his observations while sketching the various flowers and plants he came across. He spent a significant amount of time in the inhospitable Thunder Peaks and Storm Horns mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During one of his sojourns to study life in the mountains, while seeking out a species of rare wildflower, Nibulus met the fellow naturalist Elminster Aumar . While Nibulus was so focused on the scientific relationship between wildflowers and local insects, by studying and sketching their form, Elminster reminded the Cormyrian scholar that a moment should be taken to appreciate the beauty of life.</p>
<p>In their talks, Nibulus shared his experiences in the Thunder Peaks mountains, which piqued Elminster's interest. The sage of Shadowdale stated he was arranging a compilation of collected writings about the natural world of the central and north Faerûn . Nibulus offered to submit his notes to the anthology, which were assembled into a book called The Storm Horns and the Thunder Peaks . Nibulus hoped that his contributions would help dispel some of the legends and misconceptions about life in the mountains that were commonly held by the people of Faerûn.</p>
