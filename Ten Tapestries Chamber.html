<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the trader Auvrurn Labraster took one of the rooms reachable through the Ten Tapestries Chamber as his lodgings throughout the stay. After Alustriel Silverhand challenged him, he quickly called in an umber hulk and several red wizards ; their battle with Alustriel quickly turned the room to so much debris.</p>
