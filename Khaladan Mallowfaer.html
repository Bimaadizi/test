<p>Khaladan Mallowfaer was the Master of Revels at Castle Obarskyr , in Suzail , during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was dark-hearted, cowardly, sneering, and upset at people having the right to keep secrets from him. Lord Harkuldragon considered him greedy, conceited, and snake-like in his maliciousness.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As Master of Revels, he was in charge of formal protocols.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The man feared Ganrahast Aeiulvana , and resented anyone who could hide information from him. Ganrahast in turn held him in some contempt. As far as Manshoon knew, he was kinless, unmarried, and loveless.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During one of the fugitive Elminster Aumar 's covert entrances into Castle Obarskyr in Suzail , he used an amulet that was almost certainly a medallion of thoughts to scout through walls. One of the people he discovered in this way was Khaladan Mallowfaer, whom he caught talking to an exhausted senior chamberjack, Halance Tarandar ; Mallowfaer needled him about why he was so tired, to which he claimed confidentiality at Royal Magician Ganrahast's request. That was enough to get Mallowfaer to back off. Mallowfaer then called on Halance Tarandar to retrieve extra chairs from Zorsin's Dock .</p>
<p>Later, after Ganrahast and Vainrence , another high-ranking War Wizard, went missing, Khaladan Mallowfaer argued with the Steward Rorstil Hallowdant , who disagreed with many of the changes he had tried to make to the ceremonies in response.</p>
<p>After the calamitous Council of the Dragon , Lord Harkuldragon had intended to have him assassinated, for the crime of having found out something of Harkuldragon's own treasons; however, that didn't come to much, as the Lord found himself killed shortly after.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>He was rumored to be as much of an overweening, vile-hearted man as he actually was.</p>
