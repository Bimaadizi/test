<p>Eliam was a Netherese archwizard who lived during the Age of Discovery .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eliam led the enclave some time after Requiar , who had been driven insane by the Crown of Horns in 2651 NY (−1208 DR) . Inhabitants of the enclave conducted a search for the ancient crown for over 150 years, to no avail. As the members of the enclave could not find the item, Eliam hired adventurers to conduct an outside-search in the Eastern Forest , though they too, were unsuccessful.</p>
