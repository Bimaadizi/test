<p>The Flame Guard was an elite bodyguard in Suldolphor the Golden City in far eastern Calimshan during the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Flame Guard protected and enforced the law of Suldophor's ruling olanger , who was Daeranatha Dorluu as of the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . They also paid and oversaw Suldophor's militiaâ€”the Swords of Suldolphor . The Flame Guard was commanded by a pair of grizzled veterans named Golordin Maerthringul and Jalasta Kelelder . Both held the rank of High Sword. The Flame Guard numbered 2,000 soldiers who were quartered in Elaph's Tower and Corondor's Tower in the city. A typical member of the Flame Guard fought from horseback in plate armor wielding a lance , sword , and crossbow .</p>
<p>The Flame Guard was also responsible for finding Suldophor's next olanger as decreed by Waukeen , which was a bit of a controversy given the aging state of Daeranatha and Waukeen's silence since the Time of Troubles .</p>
