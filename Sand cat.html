<p>Sand cats were a species of felines found in deserts.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sand cats were slightly larger than a house cat . Their fur was colored in a way that allowed them to blend in with the desert. Their most distinguishing physical features were their large ears, each ending in a long tuft of white fur.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Sand cats had the ability to jump 5 feet (1.5 meters) vertically and 10 feet (3 meters) horizontally. Sand cats were incredibly stealthy and their senses were very sensitive, making it near impossible to sneak up on one.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A sand cat attacked prey by pouncing on its target, pinning the prey with its teeth and front claws and raking the belly with its sharp rear claws. Sand cats only attacked larger creatures such as humanoids if they were cornered and retreated at the first chance.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Sand cats were social creatures and lived together in familial groups called dens. Each den had two adults and their kittens. Sand cats mated once a year, and the parents remained with the kittens until they reached maturity, which usually took up to ten months.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Sand cats were obligate carnivores and nocturnal hunters. They played an essential part in their local areas, as they kept the population of rodents and vermin under control.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Sand cats lived in small caves or burrows in deserts or steppes. They were territorial and hunted an area with a range of up to 10 miles (16 kilometers). They were commonly encountered in the Hordelands . They could also be found around the Battle of Bones battlefield in the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Sand cats could be somewhat domesticated and were kept as pets. They were trained as kittens to hunt prey for their owner. Sand cat kittens were gifted to the leaders of human tribes. A sand cat kitten could be bought for up to 2,000 gp at a market.</p>
