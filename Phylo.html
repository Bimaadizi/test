<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phylo "ruled" the Neverlight Grove alone for a long time. When the sovereign Basidia and its two circles arrived in the Grove, Phylo was happy to have someone to share the burdens of leadership with.</p>
<p>However, two years later, when Zuggtmoy arrived in the Grove circa 1486 DR , she understood that the best strategy was to first corrupt Phylo and in order to gain control of the whole community. Phylo was easily corrupted and started a subtle battle of ideologies during the daily melding to convert all circle leaders to Zuggtmoy. Step by step, most of the myconids succumbed to madness; only Basidia and its followers resisted.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Crazed, Phylo dreamed all day about a mushroom paradise.</p>

<p>Since its arrival, Phylo was best friends with Basidia until the arrival of Zuggtmoy.</p>
