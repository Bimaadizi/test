<p>Eyes of the eagle were a magical pair of tiny lenses that fit over one's eyeballs and granted enhanced visual perception.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These lenses were made of a special crystal, typically blue quartz , and gave off a divination aura.</p>
<p>These uncommon items could be produced by skilled mages with the ability to cast the clairvoyance spell.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Wearing these lenses allowed one to make out the details of extremely distant objects as small as 2 feet (61 centimeters) in length if visibility was clear.</p>
<p>If someone only wore one of the two lenses, she or he would become dizzy but could adjust to using the single lens if covering the other eye.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>In most magic-selling shops, eyes of the eagle sold for about 2,500 gold pieces .</p>
<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>The elves of Moonwood made a variation that was incorporated into helms, to armor patrols that defended their home from orcish raids. These helms weighed about 2 lb (910 g). By the late 14 th century DR , several of these helmets found their way to the Sword Coast .</p>
<h3>Bifocals of the eagle</h3>
<p>The ageing adventurer Ratha Rann owned a pair of bifocals, where the top half of the glasses were as eyes of the eagle , with the bottom half allowing far-sighted wearers to read.</p>
