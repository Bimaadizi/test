<p>The Dragon Wood was a wooded ravine deep in the Evermoors , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . It got its name from the unusual megalith that floated at its center, called the Sleeping Dragon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Dragon Wood was located about five days' travel due west of Everlund through the Silverwood and the eastern Evermoors. It was in a sinuous ravine about three miles (4.8 kilometers) long.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Closely spaced duskwood and shadowtop trees were the primary flora in the Wood, except for the immediate area surrounding the Sleeping Dragon which was barren. The artifact floated above a rocky ridge that resembled the curved spine of a subterranean serpent.</p>
<p>Animal life in the ravine was mostly small birds and mammals. Strangely, no predators larger than a fox ever stayed in or even passed through the Dragon Wood. The atmosphere was usually very quiet and, if visitors were quiet, phrases were sometimes heard whispered on the breeze. Examples of these wafting words included:</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The ravine containing the Dragon Wood radiated strong transmutation magic and was enchanted with some form of conditional teleportation spell that gently removed large animals from the vicinity and placed them fifty to five hundred miles (eighty to eight hundred kilometers) away. Sentient races were unaffected by this environmental filter. Occasionally, the whole ravine glowed with painful witchfire , or reverberated with a song that seemed to come from some other plane .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Dragon Wood had a reputation for being haunted, mainly because of the magic guarding it, and the flicking away of large predators, but also for the whispered words that were occasionally heard. Even trolls and giants avoided settling here. The same fate was meted out to anyone attacking the Sleeping Dragon, either physically or magically.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>A band of pixies made their home in Dragon Wood and enjoyed playing tricks on those that came to examine the Sleeping Dragon.</p>
