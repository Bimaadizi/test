<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century the distillery was owned by Thisobald Thorm, the son of general Ketheric Thorm , who turned into Sharran faith . Thisobald and his staff collected sensitive information and rumors reporting it to Ketheric's Dark Justiciars .</p>
<p>The local bartender Madeline had to constantly report to Dark Justiciar Netasha about the gossips and chatter in the tavern leading to the death of her best friends Marc and Benjamin .</p>
<p>As of the 10 th Tarsakh , Thisobald continued to collect the exposing information against the Selûnite resistance and Harpers. He focused his attention on the Reithwin Mason's Guild head mason Mordfred who got drunk and called Thisobald's father a tyrant.</p>
<p>On the 6 th Flamerule of an unknown year in the late 14 th century a woman poisoned Thisobald and tried to blackmail him revealing his experiments to the Baldur's Gate's authorities. She didn't expect that the distiller was resilient to poisoning, so she got captured by him and put in a wooden barrel inside his cave laboratory.</p>
<p>In Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR He Who Was was looking for an opportunity to obtain Madeline's Ledger to hold the trial of Madeline's soul.</p>
