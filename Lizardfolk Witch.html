<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Lizardfolk Witch once was a respected shaman of her people until her tribe was made extinct by a great sickness. She believed that the plague was brought by the Great Lizard, Ibrandul . The Witch did not know how she escaped the sickness so she assumed the Great Lizard protected her as one of the deity's holy ones. Being left lone, the Witch sought safety among the "hairy ones," eventually settling in the Undergate, where the warm-blooded races allowed lizardfolk to live in relative peace.</p>
