<p>During the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ), the king of the realm of Edenvale in the Utter East tried to arrange a marriage for his daughter, Roxanna .</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>The king of Edenvale ruled from Edenvale Castle in the Sempadan Forest .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The king of Edenvale desired a son to succeed him but had sired only one daughter, Roxanna. Thus, when she came of age, he called for suitors for the princess, plotting to arrange a marriage. Roxanna thoroughly rejected this, but pressured by her father's pleading, she proclaimed "I will not be wed in service to the crown, nor traded like some prized cattle. Any man that shall marry me must first defeat me in battle."</p>
<p>Thereafter, Roxanna fought a series of duels against many would-be suitors. These were all contests of arms, and she was victorious each time. When one apparent suitor, Bryan the Bold , challenged her to bloodforge battle instead, these contests escalated into a conflict known as Matchmaker Mayhem .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The king of Edenvale had pale skin and black hair and beard. His royal regalia included a silver five-peaked crown, blue robe lined trimmed with white fur and gold, and green breeches .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The king of Edenvale had at least one daughter, Roxanna. If she married Bryan, the king would gain many grandchildren and potential heirs (at least three), which would worry neighboring kingdoms.</p>
