<p>The Ogre language , also referred to as Ogrish or Jogishk in Jotun , was a patois of the Jotun language spoken by Faer√ªnian ogres , Maztican ogres, and Zakharan ogres . The language was not spoken by the ogres of the Northern Wastes though, nor those found in most of Kara-Tur , as they instead spoke the ogre mage language .</p>
