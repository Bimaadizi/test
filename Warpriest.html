<p>Warpriests were battle-steeled and battle-ready clerics who fought for their deity when required whilst praying for peace.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These powerful members of the clergy were fierce warriors of strong will and full devotion to their deity. Warpriests spent their days preparing for war, tirelessly bribing their bodies, praying, and leading armies into training exercises. When not partaking in military training, warpriests studied history and developed their diplomacy and leadership skills. In times of peace, warpriests could be found scouting lands or spying on their nations' enemies. These clerics rarely embarked on adventurers unless they searched for specific artifacts or magic weapons to bolster their military might.</p>

<p>Warpriests were trained in handling all simple and martial types of weapons and in wearing all types of armor and shields .
