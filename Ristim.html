<p>Ristim was a young human commoner and the nephew of one of his village's elders.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ristim was a young man with black hair and a noticeably long nose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Ristim was one of the unfortunate villagers captured by the Cult of the Dragon 's slavers. Alongside Tren , Wenta , and Jorsh , the villagers were dragged to the Cult's hideout in the basement of the ruined Darnarest's tower . Unlike his fellow abductees, Ristim was left in shackles while others were transported to Myth Drannor to work in the Cult's excavation project in the Polyandrium . Thankfully, a group of heroes tasked with investigating the missing persons subsequently made their way to Darnarest's tower, scattering and slaying the cultists, and rescuing Ristim.</p>
