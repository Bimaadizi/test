<p>Tauk Kodagai was a korobokuru bushi adventurer in Shou Lung .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tauk liked the wilderness, not being comfortable in huge cities and with more cultured people around her. She had accepted being the last of her family and rarely went back to her tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Born into the Kuatan tribe, Tauk, unlike the other korobokuru women, decided to start a life as a mercenary bushi.</p>
<p>However, while she was busy fighting the rebel miners of Fukiow and routing them from their tunnels, her family was all slain by barbarians while saving the rest of the tribe. In grief and rage, Tauk decided to accept all jobs against the barbarians, fighting around the Dragonwall and into the Horse Plains .</p>
<p>Tauk accomplished some great exploits: together with the Iron Regiment , she stood against the cavalry charge at Lo Tu ; she recaptured the Rendai Hills from General Asu 's barbarians and their wild dogs; with the Haybat Imperial Archers , she helped defeat the horde of the ghostly Pin Mo Now , the Headtaker. She was also the standard bearer of General Hie Aie Shek during the cleansing of the Spice Road from bandits and she decapitated the barbarian chief Asam Meneh in one-on-one battle.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , Tauk decided to go to the Komite .</p>
