<p>The Dwarf's Pot Inn was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>This building held a hidden entrance to the sewers of Elturel in its cellar. This had been constructed by the inn's owner, Algaroz , and his friend Pinch . On the sewer side of things, this entrance was marked by a jagged gap in the brick casing of a sewer wall. Fortunately the air within the inn was typically so thick with the smells of wood smoke and provender , stale ale , and spiced stew that the odor of the sewers was rarely ever noticed.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The establishment was rather cheap. It offered clients both stale ale , and spiced stews, both of which contributed to the sewer-masking aroma.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1366 DR , it was frequented by the master thief Pinch.</p>
