<h2>History</h2>
<p>The warlock Japheth Donard strong-armed Dherk into tributing him thirty percent of the daily profits of the Razorhides at some point in 1396Â DR , leaving behind a quickly made construct . The arrangement lasted a few tendays, until Raidon Kane 's party came looking for the warlock; Dherk managed to strike Seren Juramot in the throat with a poisoned knife before the battle began. After a short fight where she still managed to bring down Japheth's construct, Dherk told them where to find their target.</p>
