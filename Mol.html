<p>Mol was a young tiefling entrepreneur and criminal from Elturel , who began their enterprises during the 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mol had light red skin and two small black horns. Her face was adorned with black markings around her eyes, and gold-colored wrapping around her right horn.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She offered a few interesting items for prospective customers, including an arrow of Ilmater , a scroll of Melf's acid arrow , and thieves' tools .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mol had convinced a number of the tiefling children who were also exiled from Elturel to join her in a life of crime, including Arabella , Doni , Mattis , Meli , Silfy , and Zaki .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Elturel was pulled down into the Nine Hells in an event that came to be known as the Descent . As they were unfairly blamed for causing the Descent, most of the tieflings within Elturgard were exiled from their homes, and forced to live as refugees. Mol and her gang decided to take that opportunity to strike out on their own. They worked as pickpockets, burglars, and con-artists, stealing and scamming what they could from outsiders that encountered the Elturian tiefling community, and even the druids of the Emerald Grove who gave them temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Mol did not abide how the tieflings, especially the children, were treated, and offered them hope of a better life in the big city.</p>
