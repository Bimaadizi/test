<p>Boogins were a form of orcish hybrid, born when orcs crossbred with quaggoths .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Boogins resembled large orcs with shaggy fur.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Neither inclined toward chaotic nor lawful behaviors, boogins were typically neutral evil .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Boogins were immune to poisons. In combat, they were known to enter a berserk rage which made them comparatively better at offense but meant they fought until either they died, or all the foes in sight did.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>At least one group of boogins was known to wield spiked clubs and bastard swords , the latter of which were coated with drow knockout poison .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Boogins were the result of orc crossbreeding with quaggoths, and thus were sometimes given as evidence that orcs would copulate with anything sufficiently humanoid. They had only ever been observed in the Underdark , and reports stated they understood and probably spoke the orc language .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , a band of five boogins led by the half-orc Grunch were active in the caverns beneath Old Skull Tor .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , the boogin population was increasing in both the far northern Upperdark and the Underdark beneath Cormanthyr .</p>
