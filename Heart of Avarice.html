<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Heart of Avarice was diamond -bladed and had several jewels set into its hilt.</p>

<p>This dagger had a mighty +5 enchantment . In addition to doing a huge amount of damage for its weapon type, it was able to uncover the presence of valuable metals within up to 20 ft (6.1 m) in each direction. If someone tried to take the dagger for themselves, they would lose a proportion of their overall power and the knowledge they possessed. If they continued to hold it, this effect would continue until the greedy wielder lost all the abilities they had gained.</p>
