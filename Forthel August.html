<p>Forthel August was a bard who was known for offering significant sums of gold to adventurers and crafting songs about their exploits during the midâ€“14 th century DR . He refused to travel and experience the world on his own, owing to the inherent danger that could be encountered on the road.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
