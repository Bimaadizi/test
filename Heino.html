<p>Some time around 1367 – 68 DR , the sage Elminster charged his apprentice Lhaeo with compiling a comprehensive report detailing the lands of east Faerûn for the Harpers , at the behest of Alustriel Silverhand , High Lady of Silverymoon . The Tethyrian mage reached out to a number of contacts across the realms, and requested that Heino and his fellow performers gather information on the nation of Thay .</p>
<p>In order to gather the information, Heino bribed Thayan officials with bottles of Elminster's Choice , and began their travels just south of the First Escarpment , continuing north to the then-independent city of Amruthar . They continued up the Thayan Plateau by mount and wagon, through Nethentir , inland to the city of Eltabbar , and eventually Tyraturos , before taking the High Road south to the port city of Bezantur . The troupe paid for their journey by performing in the more squalid establishments near the nation's numerous tax stations, but endured harassment from legion soldiers and racial prejudice directed at most of their members.</p>
