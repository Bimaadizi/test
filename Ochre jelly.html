<p>An ochre jelly ( pl : jellies ) was a dangerous variety of ooze .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ochre jellies resembled giant amoebas, dark yellow in color. A mature ochre jelly reached up to 15 feet (4.6 meters) in diameter and around 6 inches (15 centimeters) thick. However, it could compress its mass to fit through gaps of only 1 inch (2.5 centimeters). Moreover, it had a mass of 5,600 pounds (2,500 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They lurked in dungeons, slowly creeping along floors, walls, and ceilings and under and through doors and cracks looking for victims. When they were found, the ochre jelly extended itself and latched onto a victim, proceeding to constrict and engulf them. The jelly exuded pseudopods to slam and grapple foes in combat.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>If cut, an ochre jelly could split into two similar, but smaller, offspring.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
