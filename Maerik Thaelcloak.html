<p>Maerik Thaelcloak was a retied human adventurer that lived in the North Ward of Waterdeep circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . He made a living buying, selling, and trading horses and livestock for Waterdhavian nobles that didn't want to travel or bargain for themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Maerik's most well-known exploits were as a member of the so-called Masters of Monsters adventuring company. In the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , he and his band were exploring Ardeep Forest when they got too close to the site of Reluraun's Tomb . A tolerant baelnorn was dissuading them from approaching further when the tomb's insane occupant thrust a sword through the long-suffering guardian's chest before rampaging about the forest, terrorizing the rabbits, birds, and apparently the air itself. The Masters survived that encounter, but at some point they met their match and many of their group were slain.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Local gossip revealed the belief that Maerik was quite wealthy, mainly from the spoils of his adventures, but he kept a low profile and, if true, hid his wealth very well.</p>
