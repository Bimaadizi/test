<p>A portable hole was a magic item that, as the name said, created a hole.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A portable hole was a circle of black cloth, sometimes silk , about 6 feet (1.8 meters) in diameter. When not in use, the hole could easily be folded to the size of a handkerchief. The cloth was magical, woven from the webs of a phase spider and strands of ether.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>When a portable hole was spread on any flat surface, it opened an extra-dimensional hole to a non-dimensional space that was 6 feet (1.8 meters) wide and 10 feet (3 meters) deep.</p>
<p>The spell plane shift was required in order to create a portable hole . If a bag of holding was placed in a portable hole both would be lost forever, but a rift to the Astral Plane was opened. If a portable hole was placed inside a bag of holding , a gateway was opened to another plane. The portable hole and bag of holding were both sucked in, as well as any unfortunate individual within 10 ft (3 m).</p>
<p>A portable hole did not function within the phlogiston .</p>
