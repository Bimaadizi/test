<p>Hexxat was a vampire from Mezro who worked as an agent for a powerful and mysterious individual.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Carrying herself with a certain manner grace, Hexxat was cordial and respectful of others, even when they did not show her the same courtesy.</p>
<p>More than anything else, Hexxat saw herself as someone who merely survived in the world regardless of the actions she took.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hexxat was born in Mezro during the 12 th century DR , to a Mazewalker of Ubtao . She was however raised not by her mother, but several of her aunts.</p>
<p>Along with another agent Phreya , Hexxat came to be employed by an individual known as L . He tasked her with recovering three artifacts from across the Realms: The Casque of Imprisonment located in a tomb within the city of Athkatla in Faer√ªn ; the Claw of the Black Leopard found in the crypt of Durkon in Kara-Tur ; and the Shroud of the Unproved within its resting place in Zakhara .</p>
<p>Hexxat traveled to Athkatla first and slipped into the catacombs beneath the city's Grave District . She found the resting place of the reviled vampire warlord, Dragomir the Red . When Hexxat removed the casque from Dragomir's head the ancient vampire rose up, free from the magical binds that immobilized his body. Dragomir rose up turned Hexxat into a vampire. He imprisoned her within a nearby stone coffin, where she would languish for over two hundred years.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Hexxat was mentally dominating young women in the city in effort to attract a group that may free her from within the tomb. She began referring to herself as 'The Sleeper' through the voices of the women she enthralled.</p>
<p>Later that year she appeared in the village of Amkethran in Calimshan , ready to perform the final task for her patron L. In exchange for her humanity, Hexxat would hunt down the lich Korkorran , who once served her master.</p>
