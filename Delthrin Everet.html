<p>Delthrin Everet , also known as Delthrin the Deadmaster was a human man of the city of Marsember in Cormyr . He was a necromancer and local hero.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Delthrin Everet was the last remaining member of noble House Everet of Cormyr.</p>
<p>Delthrin was formerly little known among mages, until he came to Marsember's aid and animated an army of undead to help defend the city against a pirate attack. He raised lacedons , skeletons , sea zombies , ju-ju zombies , and bone sharks , who boarded an impressive six pirate vessels and tore both their crews and the ships themselves apart.</p>
<p>Though notorious for the deed, Delthrin gained great respect, fame, and popularity. However, uncomfortable with this attention, he became a recluse by 1358 DR . He devoted himself instead to his continuing necromantic experiments with drowned undead. His dwelling was supposedly guarded by many of his undead creations.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , one of Delthrin's rumored creations was an aquatic undead like a giant predatory shark . It was a monstrosity fashioned from the body parts of many different dead creatures, with multiple jawed heads, claws, and a massive set of main jaws.</p>
