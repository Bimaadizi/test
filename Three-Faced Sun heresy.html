<p>The Three-Faced Sun heresy was the belief that the sun was an overdeity . According to this heresy , this overdeity had a total of three aspects out of which two were eligible as objects of worship by mortals in the form of deities .</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Believers in this heresy claimed that Amaunator and Jergal were the aspects of highsun and dusk respectively during the days of Netheril . Later, these positions were fulfilled by Lathander , as the aspect of dawn, and Myrkul , as the aspect of dusk. After the Time of Troubles , the Morninglord, according to this heresy, experienced a time of unchallenged authority.</p>
<p>A substantial number of believers in this heresy claimed in 1374 DR that the Morninglord was close to transforming into the Yellow God. However, a minority believed that Lathander was about to take over the position as the highsun aspect, essentially handing over the dawn position to another deity, while another minority believed that a completely different god would ascend to take over the position as the highsun aspect.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Clerics who believed in this heresy were capable of accessing the Death , Law , Renewal , Sun , and Time domains . They could use both the light mace and the scythe as their favored weapon and could add the flaming quality to either of them on casting weapon of the deity .</p>
