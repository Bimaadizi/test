<p>Naltecona was the last Revered Counselor of Nexal in 1361 DR . He was governed by superstition, as were most Nexalans, and the High Priest of Zaltec , Hoxitl , had a strong influence over his actions.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He wore a green feathered cape embroidered with a cotton mesh that could lift up behind him like a peacock's tail using pluma magic. He sometimes rested on a floating litter of emerald feathers, which could gently move him around from place to place. He wore a bright green feather headdress and wore gold ornaments over his body.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was extremely wealthy and owned vast treasure that he had amassed in his palace in Nexal. He had a menagerie of exotic creatures that he kept in his palace.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His nephew Poshtli an eagle warrior was close to him and was one of the few people who would dare give him advice. . Poshtli temporarily took over for his uncle as leader of Nexal when Naltecona was kept as a captive by Cordell.</p>
<p>The high priests and magicians of Nexal were his closest advisors. He felt frustrated with them when they could not explain the portents that appeared in Nexal in the years prior to the Night of Wailing</p>
<p>When he held court, he would sit on his floating feather litter, dressed in his ornate pluma robes, while those around him wore simple cotton and had to stand in his presence, without leaving, even while he napped. When having meals, he had his servants present him with more than a hundred dishes that they prepared and then he would choose the few that he liked.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was the most brilliant general during the rule of his father Axalt . His nephew, Aztil , tried to convince him and his fellows to leave their posts, despite their excellence. During Naltecona's reign, Nexal's tribute and territory reached the largest extent in the nation's history.</p>
<p>Sometime in the early 1350s, a mysterious fire appeared in the sky over Nexal. Naltecona was perturbed by this, thinking it was a sign from the gods. He called the leading clerics of the four great Maztican gods in Nexal ( Tezca , Zaltec , Calor and Qotal ） to meet him and demanded that they explain the sign. He was advised by the high priests of Tezca and Zaltec to sacrifice more captives. Naltecona then ordered for slaves to be sacrifice and for a new expedition against Kultaka be launched to capture more victims for the sacrificial altars.</p>
<p>The expedition ended in disaster for the Nexalans. When it was reported to Naltecona, he ordered for some of the warriors who returned to offer themselves in sacrifice to Zaltec, and ordered for another expedition to be sent, but only after they had been rebuilt. Right after he gave the order, however, another portent appeared when the great pyramid of Zaltec in Nexal burst into flames without apparent cause. Naltecona ordered it to be immediately rebuilt and allowed the priests to use the Pyramid of the Moon instead.</p>
<p>Years later, shortly before Cordell 's expedition reached Maztica, another portent appeared when three of the four lakes surrounding Nexal inexplicably started churning with waves and growing hot with steam, threatening canoes and buildings near their shores. He summoned the priests and magicians again to the top of the pyramid of Zaltec to demand explanations. They told him that their gods were upset and needed more hearts, but he dismissed all of them except Coton , high priest of Qotal, since the lake that represented his god was still calm. He demanded answers from Coton about the portent, but Coton could not answer him on account of his vow of silence. Naltecona then began to believe that these events were a sign of Qotal's imminent return.</p>
<p>When Cordell and the Golden Legion reached Maztica in 1361 DR , Naltecona heard of it, he grew very worried and believed that this was indeed the return of Qotal to Maztica. He ordered for eagle warriors to watch the newcomers. . He was urged and advised by those around him to ready an army to fight the invaders back into the sea, but he initially decided to do nothing but to wait and see what happened in Ulatos Naltecona feared that the foreigners were gods, and he hoped that the Payit would defeat them, thus proving to him that they were not gods. When the Legion instead defeated the Payit, Naltecona's fear that they were gods and the return of Qotal increased. He sent them gifts of gold, after learning about how much they desired gold along with a message asking them not to come to Nexal. . However, Cordell, on learning of Nexal's great wealth, made Nexal as the primary objective of his campaign in Maztica.</p>
<p>Poshtli brought Halloran a deserter from the Golden Legion and Erixitl , a woman from Palul, back to Nexal and presented them to his uncle. Hoxitl , high priest of Zaltec urged Naltecona to sacrifice Halloran to Zaltec, but Naltecona put the man under his protection, wishing to know more about the foreigners that he feared could be gods. To appease Zaltec, however, he agreed to attend the consecration of the Viperhands .</p>
<p>When Naltecona met Halloran, he showered gifts on him, including a house with slaves, and sought to learn as much as he could about the Legion from Halloran. He invited Halloran to attend the sacrifices to Zaltec, but Halloran refused, due to his Helmite faith that rejected human sacrifice, which greatly surprised Naltecona. Halloran answered most of Naltecona's questions except he refused to give advice about how to defeat his former comrades in battle.</p>
<p>When Viperhands attempted to murder Halloran, Naltecona was informed of it and he moved Halloran into the palace for safety. When Halloran visited Naltecona's menagerie in his palace, and told Naltecona about his meeting with a Couatl near Ulatos, Naltecona was shocked by this news, as the Couatl was a sign of Qotal's return. He tried to question Halloran more about Cordell, wondering if he was a god, even though Halloran insisted that Cordell was just a mortal human and not a god.</p>
<p>After Cordell had achieved victory over the Kultakans and was marching towards Nexal, Naltecona resolved to try to fight Cordell, in the hope the Cordell was truly just a human and not a god. He devised a strategy to meet the Legion at the village of Palul . Rather than face the Legion in the field as had the Kultakans and Payits, he decided to lay an ambush for Cordell during a feast in his honor. Cordell learned of the ambush from his mage Darien and attacked the Nexalan warriors without warning. The resulting massacre nearly annihilated the Nexalan army and destroyed the town.</p>
<p>When Naltecona was informed of the defeat of the ambush, he became convinced that the strangers were truly gods. Rather than engaging them with the rest of his massive army, he welcomed them into Nexal, despite the protests of his advisors and nephew who urged him to fight. He gave the palace of his father Axalt to the Legion as well as gifts of gold. Cordell initially demanded that they end the sacrifices, but Naltecona persuaded him to allow them to continue, since the people would revolt if the sacrifices stopped. Naltecona initially only wanted the legion to enter the city and keep their Payit and Kultakan allies outside, but Cordell prevailed and forced Naltecona to allow them entry .</p>
<p>When some Viperhands tried to assassinate Cordell in Axalt's palace, Cordell kidnapped Naltecona and brought him to the palace as a hostage to ensure the Legion's security. Many Nexalans wanted to fight the foreigners after this, but Naltecona urged them not to resist and insisted that he was there by his own will. Cordell ordered Naltecona to order the people of Nexal to give up their gold to the Legion, which he reluctantly agreed. He summoned Poshtli, who had taken over as ruler of Nexal in Naltecona's place and ordered him to bring the gold of Nexal to the Legion, Poshtli protested and urged Naltecona to give the order to fight the foreigners instead, but Naltecona, still believing that the strangers were gods insisted that the order must be followed.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Viperhands and Nexalan warriors numbering over a hundred thousand assembled in the plaza around Axalt's palace to surround it, as a result of plotting by clerics of Zaltec and other Nexalans who had made plans for an attack on the foreigners. The Legion only had several hundred soldiers in their ranks and despite superior equipment, they knew that they had little chance of fighting against such a massive force. Cordell brought Naltecona to the roof the palace to address the mass of Nexalan warriors below in order to urge them to turn back.</p>
<p>However, Darien , the Legion's mage was in fact secretly a Drow member of the Ancient Ones who served Zaltec, despite having been with the Legion in Faerun for a decade. She had earned the trust of Cordell in order to bring him to her home in Maztica to use him and his legion as a pawn in a plot of the Ancient Ones to further the domination of Zaltec. She revealed her true nature to a shocked Cordell at the top of the palace, and then proceeded to murder Naltecona with an array of magic missiles within plain view of the amassed warriors, whom Naltecona had been trying to calm down. His mangled and burnt body fell from the roof into the plaza below. Darien then teleported herself away and left the Legion to meet its fate at the hands of the huge mass of enraged warriors. This event was the first act in the events that became known as the Night of Wailing , that ended with the destruction of Nexal and the demise of their civilization.</p>
