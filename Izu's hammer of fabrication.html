<h2>History</h2>
<p>Izu was a blind master smith who died in the Silver Marches sometime before the late 14 th century DR . As the blind smith spent years of his life making enchanted armor and weapons for the Harpers, his heirs gifted Izu's hammer of fabrication to a young Harper scout the smith was especially fond of. Sometime later, that Harper went missing, along with the hammer, while mapping the Upperdark .</p>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Izu's hammer of fabrication found its way to the city of Melvaunt on the Moonsea . The hammer was kept by the Gondar priests of The Purple Portals .</p>
