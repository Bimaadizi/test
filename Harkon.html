<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lord Harkon was one of the high-ranked members of Halaster Blackcloak's nameless conspiracy revealed in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR by the Seven Sisters . He participated in an emergency meeting to address the slayings of Azmyrandyr and Roeblen, who were spell-linked to Thaltar Glaervar, another Red Wizard. During the meeting, he suggested this connection gave them the opportunity to set an ambush for the Simbul , who'd come for Thaltar Glaervar. Thaltar then revealed he'd been attacked by her earlier that day, but had already slain her; he revealed a wand he'd taken from her body. The wand turned out to be the Simbul in spell-shape, who immediately set about the task of slaying them all.</p>
<p>He was the last one slain by the Simbul's spell-sphere shape after he employed a prismatic wall shaped into a sword to strike at the sphere. However, the sphere turned into a snake , the snake went down his throat, and made him explode.</p>
