<p>Zandess Danthiir ( pronounced : /ˈ z ɑː n d ɛ s ˈ d ɑː n θ ɪər / ZAHN-dess DAN-theer ), titled the "Strong Arm of Tyr", was a human paladin of Tyr from Tethyr in the mid–14 th century DR and a senior member of the Moonstars .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As a paladin, Zandess was supremely zealous in her faith and highly principled. She preferred to travel alone, but was quite willing to temporarily ally with others of similar views, for deeds well within the law.</p>
<p>Instead of a personal crest, she used the holy symbol of Tyr, a warhammer and scales, as her own.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zandess was described as beautiful and dusky-skinned.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zandess Darthiir was born a noble of Tethyr, but ran away from her decadent and feuding parents while still a child. She fled to Amn and was taken in by the priests and paladins of Tyr. They raised young Zandess in the Amnian mountains and trained her to be an "arm of justice", as a paladin of the Just God.</p>
<p>Upon completion of her training, Zandess was sent to the Inner Sea lands to do the church's work and aid Tyrran priests there. By 1367 DR , she was operating in the Western Heartlands and along the Dragon Coast . She then worked around the Dragon Reach for several years before she traveled to Impiltur . Near the end of the decade, she had joined with several efforts to eliminate the hidden evils of Narfell that threatened the kingdom of Impiltur.</p>
<p>She was among the first members of the newly formed Moonstars organization in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . She was one of twelve senior agents under Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun ; though she disagreed with his habit of bending rules and laws, she trusted his overall support for justice, law, and order.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , however, she had converted to the worship of Ilmater , the Crying God. She remained active in Impiltur and was still a member of the Moonstars.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Zandess traveled with several horses : her warhorse, pack horses, and a spare mount, all fully armored and equipped.</p>
