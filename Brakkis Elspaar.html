<p>Brakkis Elspaar was a member of the Stone-Cold Reavers , a group of reckless adventurers who made their living sometimes as sellswords and sometimes as brigands.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young white dragon Cryovain from its lair, Icespire Hold . However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brakkis was out of shape and had lost the benefits of youth.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He took advantage of any opportunities presented to him, resorting to thievery when honest work was unavailable. He was a follower rather than a leader. This suited him because all he really wanted to think and talk about were dogs and what he would do when he retired.</p>
