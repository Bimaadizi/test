<p>Altand was a village in the Misty Forest in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 th century DR . The village existed on two levels, with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient monument to an elven ranger.</p>
<p>Residences and the village temple were built into the upper boughs of the forest. The elves strung rope bridges between these sites and constructed circular walkways around the trees.</p>
