<p>King Olosar of House Tethyr was a king of the Lions' Dynasty of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Olosar and his older brother Jaszur were twin sons of King Alemander III , born when their father was only twelve years old! He was uncle to Alemander IV , who would succeed him as king.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olosar was born in 1274 DR. He took the throne upon the murder of his brother in 1295 DR . Because Waterdeep left many questions unanswered regarding his brother's death, King Olosar cancelled all trade agreements with that city, and by as late as 1370 DR , Tethyr and Waterdeep had had no significant agreements or alliances since.</p>
<p>He reigned until 1319 DR , when he was succeeded by his nephew, Alemander IV.</p>
