<p>Chanelle Hallwinter was a knight of the famed Hallwinter family who, after her passing, returned as a restless ghost beneath the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In life, Chanelle wore plate armor and wore her hair in braids. As a ghost, she appeared as a middle-aged woman with the same accoutrements.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Chanelle was interred within a sarcophagus decorated with gold paint , carved with the heraldic six-pointed crown of the Hallwinter family and a relief of herself and Makalia Siannodel in love together. Her tomb was filled with old weapons and armor, though most had rusted and rotted into uselessness by 1501 DR . Among them was an intact shield that bore the curse of missile attraction , which she was able to remove.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In life she was the loving partner of Makalia Siannodel, an elf mage . After their deaths, they were buried in twin crypts beneath Neverwinter with relief carvings on their sarcophagi depicting their lives together.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In her afterlife, Chanelle became a lost ghost with no memory of her life. She wandered the tunnels between her crypt and Makalia's, failing to remember her own identity and history and even losing her face. She was not hostile to visitors in this state, instead beseeching them for aid in recovering her identity, and sulking if refused.</p>
<p>Only in the event of her full name being spoken in her presence would she recall herself and her memories of both life and undeath. Most recently, around 1501 DR, she had witnessed Delvin Fearnehart being pursued by the Cult of Vecna , though she didn't have the faculties to understand it at the time.</p>
