<p>The Myir were a tribe of people living in the town of Nathoud between Rashemen and the Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Famed for their prized Nathoudi stallions , the Myir were not known for anything other than horse-breeding.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally part of the Nar nation, the Myir adapted to the harsh life outside of Narfell . They abandoned their nomadic ways in favor of becoming sedentary farmers since they were not able to compete with the fierce Khassadi people of the region.</p>
<p>As of the midâ€“14th century DR , the Myir had been living a stationary existence for several centuries, but they were still poor in resources and technology compared to their neighbors.</p>
