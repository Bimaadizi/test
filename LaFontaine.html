<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Waterdeep – the City of Splendors, became once again menaced by the drow from the mega-dungeon of Undermountain . The Masked Lords determined that the danger was coming from underneath the Yawning Portal , and Durnan , the proprietor of the famed establishment, put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the dungeon's depths and route the evil within.</p>
<p>La Fontaine was among the heroes who answered the call, eager to spread the faith of his goddess and to practice his healing arts. La Fontaine was present at the Yawning Portal's common room, when a squadron of drow assassins sent by "queen" Valsharess attacked. The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the city's clergy , including La Fontaine. La Fontaine thought his skills would be of more use helping hurt and the dead and refused to venture into the Undermountain, leaving the quest in the hands of the hero who would be known as the Slayer of Mephistopheles .</p>
