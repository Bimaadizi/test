<p>The Harbortower was a watchtower in Marsember in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Harbortower lay in Marsember's northwestern corner, along the wall. The Dockmarch terminated on one end at its base.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>From the heights of the tower, a lookout could look out onto the sea or, from out the windows, they could look down towards the street. According to high-level War Wizards , the place was too rickety and unstable for mighty spellcastings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>As of 1373 DR , there were several rooms. One of the rooms had a table and a cot.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The inside of the tower was always cold and drafty, even in the muggiest summers.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>There were farglasses on the window, allowing watchmen to search the horizon for pirates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The War Wizard Huldyl Rauthur had been posted on the Harbortower for a few years by 1373 DR . He was not allowed to have dalliances or cast dangerous spells while on lookout duty. Despite this, he had his meetings with Harnrim Starangh , a Red Wizard , at that location.</p>
