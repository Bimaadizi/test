<p>The Parliament of Peers was an advisory council that held governance over the city of Baldur's Gate during the latter half of the 15 th century DR . They were responsible for submitting official recommendations, regarding a myriad of civil issues, to the Dukes of the Council of Four . In addition, they were entrusted to elect new Dukes to the council that held the utmost authority within the city.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Parliament held their meetings in High Hall , using several smaller chambers and a grand, 300-seat hall for when the entire body was in attendance. Most of their sessions were open to observers, however on occasion they were forced to hold session behind closed doors.</p>
<p>They held official assemblies every day in the afternoon, though attendance was not mandatory. Typically, between twenty to thirty members were in attendance unless the topic at hand was one of particular importance. Meetings covered a wide range of issues, and were usually roaring and contentious affairs. When parliament finished debating an issue, they put forth any decisions or recommendations to the Council of Four.</p>
<p>A great number of parliament members had been bought, or were at least influenced by the Guild and its leader Nine-Fingers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The legislative body was formed shortly after the attempted coup of Duke Valarken during the mid–15 th century DR . The city's patriar urged the last remaining councilor, Duke Portyr , to form a congress of trusted citizens who decided exactly who would be elected to fill the vacant positions within the Council of Four. After electing the extremely popular Grand Duke Abdel Adrian , parliament was allowed to keep their legislative and elective powers.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Around fifty trusted Baldurian citizens made up the Parliament of Peers, who met daily, albeit seldom in full number, to discuss the city's future and recommend actions for the dukes on matters both great and small. Approximately twelve members typically hailed from the Lower City , constituting roughly one-quarter of the Parliament, with the remaining members coming from the noble families of the Upper City , known as patriars . Membership was predominantly hereditary, especially among the Baldurian patriar. The Parliament consisted of various influential figures, including retired adventurers and guild leaders.</p>
<p>New seats were created by parliament under their own power and this was always done by unanimous consent.</p>
