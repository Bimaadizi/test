<p>Yenech was a member of the Grand Council of Impiltur , residing in New Sarshell until 1396 DR .</p>
<p>In that year, the eladrin noble Malyanna kidnapped him and set her pet, the shadow mastiff Tamur , on him for entertainment. Before he died, he saw Behroun Marhana in the hidden redoubt where he was trapped, and called out to him for help, only for the latter to look away. His death helped cement the upstart Lord Marhana's bid for control and power over Impiltur; as the eladrin noble made his ally watch, it also made evident what Malyanna was capable of doing.</p>
