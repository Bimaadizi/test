<p>Deathjump spiders were a species of huge spider that appeared in the Realms following the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>These spiders could not spin webs, though they could leap great distances and were skilled at landing softly. Like many spiders they had poisonous fangs. And they viewed their surroundings through tremorsense .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Being unable to spin webs, these feral hunters relied upon ambushing their prey. They would lie within dark crevices, large trees, or underneath a thin layer of dirt and leaves that resembled a trapdoor. Once their prey was in range a deathjump spider would leap upon them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , deathjump spiders could be found beneath the ruins of Cragmire Keep , inside the Cragmire family's crypts, as well as around the the Ebon Downs . Around that time they could also be found in the pit fights conducted by the Gray Wolf tribe in Vellosk .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , an expedition of drow slavers from House Xorlarrin laid siege to a small farming town in Roth√© Valley and employed many spiders in this effort, including deathjump spiders.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
