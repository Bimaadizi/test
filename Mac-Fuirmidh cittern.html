<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Bards wielding a Mac-Fuirmidh cittern had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.</p>

A bard playing a Mac-Fuirmidh cittern could invoke the spells fly , invisibility , levitate , protection from evil and good , barkskin , cure wounds and fog cloud each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.</p>
