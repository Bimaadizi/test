<p>Charisk Expeditionary Outfitters , also called Charisk Expedition and Supply , was an Amnian trading company that operated in Amn's colony at Port Nyanzaru in Chult during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As an Amnian trading company in Port Nyanzaru, Charisk wielded a great deal of influence in the city and was in constant political and financial competition with the other trade companies. Affiliation with the company granted the right to reside within the safety of Port Nyanzaru's wall.</p>
<p>Unlike other Amnian trading companies, Charisk's agents valued local suppliers and worked to make friends and forge trade deals with the Chultan and lizardfolk tribes of the jungle. These tribes supplied the company with guidance through the jungle, trade goods, rare plants and animals , and treasures like gold , jewels , and ancient relics, while the company provided them with firewater , glass beads, and manufactured goods in return.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Agents of Charisk were given special masks that marked them as allies to the tribes of the jungle, allowing them to parlay without violence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Charisk participated in sponsoring a great hunt that served as a competition between Port Nyanzaru's dozens of trading companies. They vied against the other companies—notably House Selemchant , Naelishti's Naturals , the Order of Belox , and Zazefay Logging and Mining —to recruit the most capable hunters. The rules of the competition forbade competitors to hire local guides, however Charisk's good relationship with nearby lizardfolk tribes offered their hirelings a loophole around this restriction.</p>
<p>Amnian companies like Charisk were subsequently expelled from Port Nyanzaru by the Ytepka Society and a local merchant consortium in the late 15 th century DR, and were replaced by seven merchant princes as the city's mercantile and political leaders. Charisk's trade in plants was taken over by the prince Jessamine , trade in animals fell to Ifan Talro'a , gold and jewels came to be controlled by Zhanthi , ancient relics and lore came to be controlled by Wakanga O'tamu , and alcohol came to be controlled by Kwayothé .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The company's liaison to hired adventurers was a hardy dragonborn explorer who had spent time living among the lizardfolk tribes near Port Nyanzaru.</p>
