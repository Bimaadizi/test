<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to legends, long before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Soggy Nurkel, still a mere child, got lost in swamplands while chasing some toads around. The area was clouded in fog, and the child followed the lights that turned out to be will-o'-wisps . Somehow Soggy managed to weave a magic shield out of swamp reeds and used it to crush will-o'-wisps as the gnome snuck around the bog. Later, annual festivals were held to celebrate Soggy Nurkel's life that lasted at least into the late 14 th century DR. Making a copy shields of the Wisp Hunter was a part of the festival, and many of these magic items had been created over the years.</p>
