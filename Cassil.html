<p>Cassil was a shrub used by rich men as birth control.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cassil looked very similar to a simple mustard plant. The plant itself held little value, however, its seeds were gathered for their medicinal properties. Eating a little ground cassil seed rendered a man infertile and unable to propagate for a period of time from four to twelve days. On average, the medicine took effect within an hour. One dose of the herb cost a single gold coin . This effect was exclusive to humanoids .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>There were many tales of rulers being dosed by their disloyal courtiers with powdered cassil in order to end their family line.</p>
