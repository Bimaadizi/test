<p>Netherese was a language spoken in Netheril both before and after Karsus's Folly in −339 DR . Though it was considered a dead language by 1372 DR , scholars believed that it evolved into the Halruaan and Ruathlek languages.</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Netherese was the primary language of Low Netheril, but it was also spoken by commoners in High Netheril. ( Loross , its sister language, was spoken by the nobles of High Netheril. )</p>
<p>While by 1374 DR , Netherese had not been commonly spoken for over one thousand years, small pockets of Netherese speakers did still survive, particularly among the shades and Shadovar of the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Netherese used the Draconic script known as Iokharic .</p>
<h2>History and Legacy</h2>
<p>The Netherese language was one of the oldest known human languages, dating back to two or three thousand years before the beginning of the Dalereckoning . It was part of the Ulou language family , which also included Ulutiun and Damaran .</p>
<p>The term "Netherese" was also used by scholars to refer to Netherese and those languages derived from it, namely, Halruaan and Ruathlek .</p>
<p>While Halruaan and Ruathlek were the direct linguistic descendents of Netherese, several other common languages bore traces of the Netherese tongue, including Chondathan , Damaran, Illuskan , and Tethyrian .</p>
<p>The ruins of Low Netheril in the Anauroch desert were covered in Netherese writing, and Netherese words were often used as "command words" for magic items.</p>
