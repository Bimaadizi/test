<p>A uropygus , also known as a giant whip scorpion , giant pedipalp , monstrous uropygid , or occasionally giant vinegaroon , was a very rare and dangerous creature, mainly found in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uroypgi were the largest type of pedipalpi . They had spiny bone-armored pincers and feelers like the smaller types, but also had tails which resembled the stinger of a scorpion. It was sometimes called a giant vinegaroon due to its acidic spray.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Uropygi fought with their two pincers and vicious bite. They could execute a gripping attack, and if the opponent could not escape it, they crushed and held in place for a series of bites.</p>
<p>As well as using their appendages, these creatures were also able to release poison gas thrice a day. The yellow, sultry and acrid gas would expand around a 20' radius sphere and those within would uncontrollably spasm and tremor.</p>
