<p>The wardstone was an object in Surgath Ilder 's possession.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>It flashed when operating. Its actual operating mechanism was unknown, but Surgath Ilder had expected it to thwart curses.</p>
<p>Its effects were inverted with a spell once. When inverted, its powers quickly slew the person they were protecting with a flame so intense it scorched some rubies .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Surgath Ilder had purchased the item around 239 DR for two rubies. In 241 DR , he was using it for protection against a curse he expected to be in place on some rubies he had just traded for, but Heldebran employed a spell to invert its functions, causing it to quickly incinerate Surgath Ilder with flames powerful enough to damage some of his rubies.</p>
