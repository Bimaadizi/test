<p>Burlen was a warrior from Vaasa that traveled alongside Vala Thorsdotter and a few others on an important journey to the depths beneath Evereska in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Like the other Vaasan warriors that were honored to carry out their mission in the west, Burlen was the proud owner of a darksword . Each of these blades possessed a unique quirk; Burlen's sword hummed while he was engaged in combat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Burlen accompanied Vala and others of her company to hold up the bargain of Bodvar the Black . They traveled all the way from Vaasa to the Shaeradim in Western Heartlands . Together they delved into the crypts of House Vyshaan near the Sharn Wall , joined up with Melegaunt Tanthul , and gained admittance into the city of Evereska . The group even ventured back underground to rescue a pair of elven nobles from the phaerimm .</p>
<p>After Vala and her new traveling companions entered into the returned Netherese city of Thultanthar the following year , Burlen and the other Vaasan warriors remained in Evereska. They helped defend the city against the phaerimm , fighting alongside Keya Nihmedu and the elven Company of the Cold Hand in skirmishes across the Vine Vale .</p>
<p>During the battle on Mirtul 20 , Burlen and his fellow Vaasan warriors suffered grievous wounds. Both he and Kuhl were reassigned to escort Khelben Arunsun . Within a few days, Khelben, the Vaasans and the rest of Evereska's defenders were united with Laeral Silverhand and the Army of the North . Unfortunately, they were all abandoned and betrayed by the Shadovar . Burlen himself was somehow compelled to attack Lady Silverhand with his darksword , severing her arm below the elbow. Fortunately for Laeral, Burlen was knocked out cold by Kuhl and they were all transported to safety.</p>
