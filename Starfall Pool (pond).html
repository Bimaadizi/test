<p>Starfall Pool was a small pond located in the Moonwood of north Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . It got its name from the many stars that could be seen reflected in its mirror-like surface on a clear, quiet night. It was made famous throughout Luruar by the "Ballad of Starfall Pool" .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Starfall Pool was almost due north from the Hunter's Gate of Silverymoon about 50 miles (80 kilometers). Upon reaching the edge of the forest, it was about another mile (1.6 km) into the trees.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This small pond had a bed of solid stone that could be clearly seen through the crystal waters. The cool water was slightly acidic, but potable, and supported a colony of frogs along its moss-covered banks. The glade where the pond formed was home to an illusion of a wandering shield that sometimes passed over the water.</p>
<p>There was a portal in the pool that could be activated by uttering certain words while submerged beneath the surface. When queried about the destination of this portal , Elminster , the Sage of Shadowdale , said only "more than one dragon waits at the other end", and admonished any would-be explorers to put all their worldly affairs in order before they stepped into the Pool.</p>
