<p>Resino was a young man from Beregost who became the reason for the creation of rings of clear thought some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Resino was just a young man when he became afflicted with voices that incessantly attacked his mind. Resino turned to a local temple for help in ending his miserable existence. The temple's clergy was unable to determine what kind of demon was plaguing Resino. Yet, the church refused to take Resino's life, instead, it ceased rings of clear thought that would help with Resino's strange affliction. However, these rings enhanced the young man's senses but did nothing to stop the voices. Eventually, unable to suffer anymore, Resino took his own life.</p>
