<p>The Moonwood was a large forest north of Silverymoon in the Silver Marches . By about 1460 DR , the Moonwood had grown together with the Cold Wood and the larger forest was known as the Glimmerwood , although the elves and the locals still referred to it as the Moonwood.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Moonwood was located between Silverymoon and Mithral Hall and was bound by the River Surbrin to the west and the River Redrun to the northeast. Directly to the north of the Moonwood was the Druarwood ; across the Redrun were the Night Trees forest groves and, beyond them, the Cold Wood . It was one of the woodlands that were collectively called the Moonwoods by some local folk.</p>
<p>By the mid–15 th century DR , these four woods had grown together and became known as Glimmerwood.</p>
<h2>Flora</h2>
<p>The Moonwood was dominated by evergreens , shadowtops , and duskwoods .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Although the Moonwood was known to be free of orcs and other goblinkind , the forest was known to be the haunt of many lycanthropes , primarily in the northern reaches. Many of these lycanthropes were members of the People of the Black Blood , while others were members of the Eldreth Veluuthra . As of 1374 DR , the two organizations often clashed, and the greater number and superior organization of the People of the Black Blood meant the odds were in their favor.</p>
<p>The southern section of the Moonwood was home to small bands of moon elves . Druids also resided in the Moonwood, and were known for crafting amber acorn necklaces, which could summon powerful allies of nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the rise of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the 1370 DR , orc tribes raided the outer edges of the forest for lumber. In retaliation, the pegasus -riding elf warrior Tarathiel attacked them.</p>
