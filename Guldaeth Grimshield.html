<p>Guldaeth Grimshield was an old dwarf adventurer who lived in the village of Highbank Forest in the Vast around 1370 DR .</p>
<p>Speaking of dangers and rumors to be found in the Vast, Guldaeth once joked dryly, "Come one, come all, here to the Vast. All the killing's happening here, and the next handful of dooms to befall us all are a-hatching hereâ€”why wait for them to crawl to you? Come to the Vast, and join the slaughter."</p>
