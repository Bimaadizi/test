<p>Beholder armor was an odd kind of magical device used by beholders to walk around.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The armor very closely resembled full plate mail +1 used by humanoids , but was built specifically for beholders to use. The beholder rested on a seat of sorts atop the shoulders, and was tied in securely with straps and buckles.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Beholder armor was used by beholders that wished to have a more "hands on" experience in combat. Once attached it allowed the beholder to walk about at a quick pace and use both gauntlet hands to hold items or weapons in addition to their typical beholderish abilities.</p>
