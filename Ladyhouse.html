<p>The Ladyhouse was a temple in the Sunset Vale dedicated to Sheela Peryroyl , a goddess of nature and agriculture in the halfling pantheon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Ladyhouse was nestled in a hollow among the hills and pastures east of Corm Orp , where it was well situated for the priests to keep an eye on grazing pigs and to watch for potential raiders and incursions from the Zhentarim out of Darkhold .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was large—much larger than it looked at first glance—and was emblazoned with a daisy symbol. It was surrounded by gardens, the most notable of which were the "wild gardens", small nature preserves where local weeds, shrubs, and trees grew freely. These plants were considered sacred to Sheela Peryroyl, and any cutting or burning of them was forbidden.</p>
<p>The temple's interior was filled with climbing vines and flowers .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Ladyhouse was seen as not only the spiritual center of Corm Orp, but also its agricultural and even social center. The temple was actively involved in breeding crops, assisting local farmers, and protecting the surrounding grazing land. The clergy were consulted on everything from the health of crops to predictions about the weather.</p>
<p>Halfling worshipers made donations of their best flowers and other plants to the temple, both for breeding and for rituals.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The priesthood spent their days chanting the praises of their goddess. They were relied on to keep watch for bandits and thieves as well as wolves and other beasts that might threaten the local livestock. To this end, some of the priests were highly skilled archers .</p>
<p>The temple was home to sixteen acolytes , eight priests, and four experienced clerics. As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the clergy was headed by Alliya Macanester , who was much beloved by the local halflings and was the true—if unofficial—ruler of Corm Orp.</p>
