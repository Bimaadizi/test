<p>Battlemaster Agarta the Breaker was a senior officer of the Night Brigade gang in Wheloon Prison in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Agarta had very pale skin, bright blue eyes, and short white hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The Battlemaster was exceptionally, overwhelmingly bloodthirsty and aggressive, finding her purpose in life and death struggle. Outside of battle, she was reasonably thoughtful and calculating.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She wore a suit of black plate armor and carried an axe . Among her other possessions, she had a sturdy belt , quick boots , a keepsake trinket , and the powerful greatsword nightbringer's wake .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agarta served the Night Brigade gang by overseeing their more martial operations. She was broadly responsible for training and maintaining their "soldiers", and operated a series of arenas where beasts and prisoners killed each other and served as target practice for her troops. Among her contestants, willing or unwilling, were a displacer beast , a crocodile , a band of orcs led by Bonegnasher the Cursed , the cloud giant Durvastra , and the Purple Dragon knight Ser Gregori the Broken . She even managed to keep a large amount of Riverside Rats wererats , who were unable to escape due to wearing magical prisoner collars. Agarta was always looking to maximise the profit and excitement of her arenas, and could even have specific victims smuggled into the prison by bribing the right people.</p>
<p>Her time came to an end when the Night Brigade faced the counterattack of the Riverside Rats gang. After Ryndalla Cuttail escaped her arena alone, she gathered allies and sent them in to rescue her fellow wererats and eliminate the Breaker. The Rats' agents sneaked into her arenas and cut their way through her forces before finally finding her in person overseeing the giant Durvastra in an arena match. When Durvastra faltered against the invaders, she threw herself into the arena herself and gleefully fought to the death, leaving the Night Brigade without a key officer to manage their forces.</p>
