<p>The dwarven brawler's wraps were a set of magical handwraps found in the ruins of Tethyamar during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The handwraps gave great power to the wearer's fists, making every blow a crushing impact that disoriented and discombobulated. The wraps had a particular animus towards evil outsiders , inflicting devastating wounds upon them and potentially banishing them with each strike.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By legend, the wraps were created by a dwarven hero who fought against the drow . When his axe broke in battle, he took a swig from his flask and tore his tunic into strips, wrapping them around his hands. He proceeded to win the battle with nothing but his mighty punches, driving them from the battlefield. The handwraps were later found in Tethyamar, after the demon lord Graz'zt was defeated and his schemes thwarted by the forces of the Tethyamar Mining Outpost .</p>
