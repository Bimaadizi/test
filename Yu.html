<p>Yu was a fishing community and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yu was a very poor village, but its people were friendly. As a whole, the people of Yu were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.</p>
<p>Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops.</p>
<p>The village had a population of about 275 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Yu was located on the west coast of the Fochu Peninsula of Tsukishima , north of Fochu , off a spur trail from the Hisano Road .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Villages in Wa were run by an administrator known as a shoya , typically a minor samurai , and Yu was no different in this respect. The shoya could call upon a local militia if needed. The shoya of Yu after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) was Fu Pukiyi , a simple-minded but pleasant fellow.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The cost to spend the night in one of the small minkas was 2 fen . The village did not produce anything more expensive than 2 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 28 citizens of Yu served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Yu were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies , the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever.</p>
