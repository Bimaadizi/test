<p>Vampire muses were a variety of vampires that originated from the Feywild and were renowned for stimulating creativity in artists.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These vampires were stunningly beautiful and eladrin -like in appearance, barely distinguishable from a living creature.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Vampire muses could dominate other creatures with their gaze, could charm undominated creatures to move away by means of a song, and could psychically impede a creature's movement with their touch. Finally, due to their fey origins these vampires could teleport short distances.</p>
<p>Each vampire muse kept an ornate cauldron in their hidden lair that they filled with blood, which acted as the ultimate source of their power. They functioned similarly to a lich 's phylactery , restoring a vampire muse to undeath thirty days after their body crumbled to dust from being killed. The only way to permanently eliminate one was to find and destroy their blood cauldron.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vampire muses were quite elusive in combat and willing to take risks due to their near-indestructibility. They would typically use their fey nature to teleport their way close to a foe, then dominate them with their gaze. They would then charm other foes away with their song, while having the dominated target intercept those unaffected.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Like most vampires, a vampire muse was a sanguinivore, which they slowly stole from the artists they inspired creativity in. They placed a great deal of this blood within their ornate cauldron.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Vampire muses were native to the Feywild. In the Shadowfell , vampire muses could be found in the city of Evernight , that plane 's reflection of Neverwinter .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Vampire muses truly valued the relationships they developed with mortals, who with their inspiration could potentially achieve renown in creative endeavors such as epic poems, paintings, or songs. But they would likely die soon afterward, becoming a gaunt and hollow-eyed husk.</p>
<p>They were often accompanied by living creatures, who served them in hopes of being chosen as companions.</p>
