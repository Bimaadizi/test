<p>Bowls of blood were a type of enchanted bowl that filled with fresh blood on command.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This bowl had a similar appearance to many other magical bowls in the Realms, such as the bowl of commanding water elementals . They were often carved out of a massive bloodstone gem and were about 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter and 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) deep.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This bowl magically itself with blood. This was done either upon command, once every twenty four hours, or every four minutes after an activation. While inside it, the blood conjured by the bowl did not congeal. There were a variety of applications for this including writing ink , material components , medical supplies, a lure for sanguivorous creatures like stirges , or blinding one's opponent. Some versions could be commanded to fill up to three time per day, but vanished after fifty uses.</p>
<p>In the case of medical use, this blood was compatible with any blood type. Around 80% of these bowls conjured human blood, but there some that contained the blood of elves , gnomes , or even dragons . This last type only had a limited number of uses, ranging from nine to ninety, and would vanish once it reached that limit.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>The master vampire of Waterdeep , Artor Morlin , was known to have one of these installed in his coffin hidden in the Fireplace Level below the North Ward , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
