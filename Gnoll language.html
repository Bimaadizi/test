<p>The Gnoll language , also referred to as Gnollish , was the language of gnolls and flinds .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The language was not a complete one, only able to communicate basic concepts. It consisted of cackling, howling, and whining sounds and often relied on gestures and facial expressions. Such words were mixed with a broken version of the Abyssal language , allowing the leaders among them to communicate more complex thoughts.</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Beyond gnolls themselves, Gnoll was sometimes spoken as a second language by bugbears , elves (of the Chondalwood , the Forest of Lethyr , and the High Forest ), fey'ri , forest gnomes , goblins , lizardfolk , orcs , half-orcs , and zebranaurs . Among elves it was typically learned by moon elves and wild elves .</p>
<p>When it came to regions, Gnoll was somewhat common as a language in Anauroch , Dambrath , Lapaliiya , Rashemen , the Shaar , Thay , Thesk , and among warriors in Thar . Gnomes of the Great Dale and halflings of Channath , the Chondalwood, and Luiren also occasionally spoke it.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>Gnoll had no true script or written form, but some gnolls were shrewd enough to write in Abyssal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gnolls believed that their language was a gift to them from Yeenoghu . Some scholars found the many connections in Gnoll with the Abyssal language to lend evidence to the theory that gnolls had demonic bloodlines.</p>
