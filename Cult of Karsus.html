<p>The Cult of Karsus , also called the Church of Karsus , was a collection primarily of wizards and specialty priests called Heartbloods who worshiped Karsus , the Momentary God.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Cult faded away before any kind of formal hierarchy could be established, with the only title or rank being the Heartbloods.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Most cult members concerned themselves with the daily operations of Karse , primarily mining metal deposits from the Star Mounts .</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Ritual after ritual was performed with the hopes of resurrecting their god, most of which were inspired by dream visions of the Cult's leaders. Most of these rituals involved a synchronization with the beating heart statue of Karsus.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The most notable location for the Cult was the Shrine of the Undying Heart which stood atop the butte near Karse where Karsus' fell. The inhabitants of Karse in -298 DR formed the foundations of the Cult that lasted only for ten years. Followers within the Cult believed Karsus would somehow return and restore the power of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>The Cult taught that the fall of civilization, specifically Netheril, was a prime example of human folly and pride and a result of the punishment of the gods. It was believed that Karsus would be reborn to deliver humanity into a new golden age tempered with the experience of the past.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>The Order of Thaumaturgists was composed of Cult members who performed spell research.</p>
