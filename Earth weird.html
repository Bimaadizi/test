<p>Earth weirds were elemental weirds from elemental earth . Some were summoned for their renowned powers as diviners in matters related to wealth and dooms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The upper half of an earth weird typically appeared like a brown clay female humanoid composed entirely of earth, but the lower half could appear serpentine or like a column of earth rising from the ground.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The earth weirds were capable of foretelling events of doom or of great wealth with equal dispassion. They saw the passage of time with the same dispassion as the mountains. They would utter their prophecies as general fates, as the mortals to whom they spoke lacked the ability to comprehend immutable futures. In that same vein, emblems of finality and bounty appealed most to the earth weirds as tribute for their prophetic words, like dust from a skull of a lich who had lived a thousand years, or a gemstone that had never seen the light of day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Due to their bodies being composed entirely of earth, piercing-based attacks were ineffective against them while a slow spell was required for edged and blunt weapons to have any meaningful effect.</p>
<p>Earth weirds generally fought by ambush, appearing as nothing more than slightly raised patches of dry earth until their prey were within 10 feet (3 meters). Once close, they would form into their serpentine forms and lash out against anyone within 15 feet (4.6 meters). Once slain, they would reconstitute within a minute, coming back fresh and hale once more. Only by scattering its constituent parts or using the passwall or move earth spells upon it remains would it be truly slain, never to rise again.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Earth weirds fed of the earth surrounding dead bodies that were decomposing into the ground, and each would maintain a territory keeping other earth weirds out by either intimidation or combat. The dirt that made up their constituent parts were highly prized by magic users as it was especially useful as components in various spells involving earth like passwall , flesh to stone , or transmute rock .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Those earth weirds living in the Elemental Plane of Earth would occasionally join local pechs in their inter-tribal warfare, fighting alongside a neighboring tribe against other pech tribes from further afield.</p>
<p>Some acted as servants of Laduguer and Abbathor , owing to the earth weirds' powers of divining in matters of mineral wealth. Others were bound to Ogrémoch and were once mortal worshipers of that primordial who had become earth weirds as rewards for exceptional service to the Tyrant of the Black Earth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , several earth weirds were encountered in the Savage Frontier ambushing travelers.</p>
