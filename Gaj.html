<p>Gaj was a market town mostly inhabited by hard-working dwarves and gnomes , located to the southwest from the Blade Kingdoms , on the westernmost foothills of the Maerthwatch in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of the 14 th century DR , Gaj was an unwalled settlement that housed numerous crafters, and areas surrounding it were farmed land.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The town was ruled by an elected council of twelve called the Luth. The council members all were senior crafters. The Luth commanded the town's Gajmar, the title given to the leader of Gaj's town watch. The watch consisted of cudgel -armed "trusties" and spies who kept an eye on visitors and outsiders, as well as spellcasters who watched over outsider mages , adventurers, and other notable powerful individuals. The town watch prevented gangs and criminal organizations from forming in Gaj and stopped thefts, blackmail, and arson.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Being a major trade settlement, Gaj's industry was based around its shallow copper and silver mines with an occasional gold vein. The dwarven inhabitants worked the mines while gnomes manned the town's smelters and foundries. Gaj produced copper wire grips for tolls and weapons, wire jewelry mounts and handles, teapot handles, and other such items. These products were exported to coastal Chondath and Chessenta . In turn, Gaj imported clothing, woven textiles, and fine wine .</p>
<p>The town was fed by its farms that produced goat cheese , milk , mutton , and vegetables. Gaj also produced lower-quality wines and ales , both sour-tasting. The town's cuisine consisted of a variety of soups and stews with leeks , marrows , dilvarrens , roast goat , goat milk , and redroot . Gaj's specialty breads were barley breads and nutbreads , with walnuts —nicknamed "brains"—being prevalent.</p>
