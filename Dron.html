<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa the 1480s DR, Dron and Utna accompanied the warlock Sangin to Toril on the Prime Material plane in order to recover a specific magical item that allowed travel away from Barovia. The trio briefly worked together to claim the item for themselves, to escape from Strahd's ever-present and far-reaching control.</p>
<p>After tracking the item to the city of Baldur's Gate , they abducted the cleric Nerys Kathon in order to determine the authenticity of the relic . They were interrupted by the Heroes of Baldur's Gate , an adventuring party that prevented them from claiming the item, a locked that once belonged to Tatyana . After a brief battle, Dron and Utna, along with Sangin, Nerys, and the adventurers were transported by the mists of the Shadowfell back to Barovia.</p>
<p>Once back in the Domain of Dread , Dron and Utna abandoned the adventurers and Sangin, who had abducted back to Castle Ravenloft . They returned to their pack at the caves near the lake, and reported what had happened to their pack leader Kiril. The warlock Sangin barged into the cave network having been turned as an undead vampire , demanding that one of either Dron or Utna be slain as punishment for their failure. Kiril chose Dron, and the lycanthrope was torn apart and feasted upon by his fellow pack members.</p>
