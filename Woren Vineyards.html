<p>The Woren Vineyards were the renowned vineyards of the city-state of Nimpeth , famed throughout the Vilhon Reach region, in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>These sprawling vineyards were composed of the heavily landscaped Broken Hills , a rough and rugged plot of land immediately beyond Nimpeth's northeastern wall that had been molded through years of slave labor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The wine produced at the Woren Vineyards was said to be of an exceptional quality, touted throughout the Vilhon Reach as the finest in the whole region. The farther away one took a bottle of Nimpeth wine from its city-state, the more valuable and pricey it became.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over time the profitability of the Woren Vineyards proved so considerable that it outpaced Nimpeth's slave trade economy, leading the city-state to concentrate more of its efforts towards supporting the vineyards.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , when writing his book on the Vilhon Reach, Adamar Session remarked on how he found the Woren Vineyards to be a marvel of landscaping, even though he found the slavery used to achieve it distasteful.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>These vineyards were owned by Lord Woren , the ruler of Nimpeth in the 14 th century DR, whose considerable wealth was partially derived from its success. Much of the vineyards were tended to by slaves, an ever-present facet of Nimpeth society.</p>
