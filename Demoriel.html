<p>Demoriel was a demon. It was summoned to fight against Gage , a thief from Laothkund , by Sathra of the Shadow Tongue thieves' guild: the necromancer called it by name. It was a black, humanoid, scaled creature, with inky teeth and claws. Wielding Angul , Gage managed to slay Demoriel, but it was a tough fight: the demon showed the power to scream abyssal curses to liquify stone and metal.</p>
