<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the mid-14 th century DR she was one of the youngest mages of power in the North. In mid- Kythorn of 1357Â DR , she discovered the location of Thalon's Throne from a book found in catacombs beneath Everlund while helping mages clear out wraiths . She teleported almost straight there, after giving her apprentice instructions on how she wanted the house kept, and bequeathing unto him the Helm of Hiding temporarily.</p>
<p>Teleporting to a hill alongside the River Dessarin on the edge of the High Forest , she found the tower holding the Throne by twilight. After bypassing a naga and receiving a warning, she entered the tower and bypassed its traps. At its final room, she met Thalon , who attacked her with spells. She defeated the lich, but before she could take the throne she was struck down by a rain of stones.</p>
<p>It turned out to be the work of her apprentice, Blaskyn; finding her helpless he took most of her obvious magical items and sat on the throne, only to be subsumed by Thalon and become his new body. Though she was badly injured, she managed to destroy the lich by detonating the necklace of missiles which Blaskyn had taken from her and donned without bothering to identify. She fainted afterwards, but woke up, healed herself, and then teleported back to Loudwater, deciding to leave the throne for later.</p>
<p>After returning to Loudwater, she discovered that Thalon had somehow modified her list of apprentices, making himself the only name in the list. She resolved to destroy the throne as soon as possible.</p>
