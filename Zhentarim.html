<p>The Zhentarim ( pronounced : / z z ˈ h ɛ n t ɑː r ɪ m / zz-HENT-ah-rim ) also known as the Black Network , was a mercenary company and greater mercantile organization in Faerûn , who, over their 200 years of existence, had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves , spies, assassins , and malevolent wizards , who for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods Bane and Cyric . Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes, but also major misfortune, particularly for their historical strongholds around the Moonsea . As of 1489 DR the Zhentarim was headquartered in the Western Heartlands , at Darkhold Castle , nestled in the valley of the same name .</p>
<h2>Aims & Goals</h2>
<p>As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon , the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faerûn. After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser mages to his cause, they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control, or, if they couldn't exert control over something, extinction.</p>
<p>After the mass purge by the Cyricists, known as the Banedeath , and the subsequent partial destruction of Zhentil Keep following the Cyrinishad debacle, the control of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping Fzoul Chembryl . He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to Iyachtu Xvim , Bane's divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the goals of the Zhentarim returned to their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the best guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faerûn, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of the practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence, and power.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In order to achieve their financial goals, the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faerûn's more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves, poison , drugs and even smokepowder weapons .</p>
<p>As a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the Zhentilar army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous humanoids to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, and arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their mages summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely on the protection of the Zhentilar.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Inner Circle</h3>
<p>From the early years of the organization until 1369 DR , the Zhentarim was led by the triumvirate of Manshoon , the ultimate authority and Lord of Zhentil Keep ; Sememmon , his student in the arcane who presided over Darkhold; and Fzoul Chembryl , the High Priest of Bane. However, the Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart.</p>
<p>In addition to his role as the ultimate authority of the Zhentarim, Manshoon held the title of High Lord of Zhentil keep, speaker of the city-state's Council of Lords , and had the full backing of the Zhentilar army. He kept close control over the Moonsea Zhentarim, and controlled the other city states such as Hillsfar , the Citadel of the Raven, and even Mulmaster . Prior to the partial destruction of Zhentil Keep, Manshoon moved his operations over to the Citadel.</p>
<p>The obedient and skillful lieutenant of Manshoon long served as the Lord of Darkhold and unfailingly loyal servant of the Zhentarim. Due to its distance from Manshoon and the Moonsea Zhentarim, the mage-lord only recruited the most loyal and capable agents, about 1000 strong, to the dark keep hidden within the Far Hills . Sememmon's second-in-command was the powerful mage Ashemmi , a former Harper , his consort and true love.</p>
<p>Before he became the exarch of Bane following the Spellplague , the faithful servant Fzoul served as the High Priest of his clergy at the Black Altar in Zhentil Keep.</p>
<h3>The Moonsea</h3>
<p>While many on the Council of Lords of Zhentil Keep chose positions of subservience or acquiescence to the Zhentarim, a few of the Keep's Lords were active and proud members of the Zhentarim, including:</p>
<p>Following his ascension during the Time of Troubles , Cyric's followers gained prominence within the Zhentarim. Many of the organization's Banites converted to Cyricism and often had conflicts with those who chose to worship Iyachtu Xvim, Bane's divine son.</p>
<p>Meer , the Head of Caravans for the Zhentarim, was overseen by the dark mage Sarthor . He worked with Aghebar who directed individual Zhentarim merchants and Maglor the apothecary. They were served by several caravan masters: Ultan Rathelstan , Krommiar Kethyr , Neth Ilturin , Lhemako Taraskh , and (after 1369 DR) Samras Quolcon and Tamek Ilturin .</p>
<p>While not official members of the Zhentarim, their wide-reaching influence gave them access to political powers, military units, and groups of skilled individuals.</p>
<h3>The West</h3>
<p>Sememmon was served by group of stealthy killers known as The Three : Mairhe , Sahbonn , and Itlur .</p>
<p>Ashemmi had a number of Zhentarim mages serving as her apprentices.</p>
<h3>Post Re-emergence of Bane</h3>
<p>After 1370 DR , the Black Network followed a strict linear hierarchy with Fzoul Chembryl serving as the Zhentarim's Grand Tyrant. Only the powerful lords would report directly to him, while lesser officers and agents would only report to their immediate superiors.</p>
<p>The only exception to the inherent power structure of the Zhentarim was Manshoon. While he allowed Fzoul to act as the supreme leader of the Zhentarim, he maintained command over any of its agents or resources to further its goals or his own endeavors.</p>
<p>A number of the leaders of the Moonsea city-states either joined the Zhentarim or were otherwise manipulated into serving them:</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Allies</h3>
<p>The Zhentarim had few allies, in comparison to their foes, but they were highly valued for their strategic value. The roster of these supporters were constantly changing along with interests and powers of the Zhentarim. They included:</p>
<h3>Foes</h3>
<p>Over the years, the Zhentarim drew the ire and hostility of a great number of peoples and organizations. They opposed any group they perceived as a threat to their interests to grow their trade and influence across Faerûn, including the Iron Throne of the Sword Coast , the Rundeen of Calimshan , and the fanatical Cult of the Dragon . They included:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Founding</h3>
<p>The Zhentarim was founded in the Year of Bright Dreams, 1261 DR , by the power-hungry wizard Manshoon, the lord of Zhentil Keep, as a tool for his ambitions of expanding his realm of control. He was soon joined by the Banite cleric Fzoul Chembryl in the Year of the Tressym, 1263 DR , who broke away from the orthodox church in Mulmaster , bringing with him a small army of his fellow priests into the lesser ranks of the Zhentarim. He then disposed of the high-ranking priests within Zhentil Keep and converted the city's lesser clergy to the worship of Bane. Paranoid even in the early years of their alliance, Manshoon offset the possible threat of Fzoul's influence by concocting a plan with the beholder Xantriph. They had the Banite priests confess their sins and swear fealty to Manshoon alone. Xantriph's lair, the floating Temple in the Sky, became an outpost for Zhentilar troops and Banite priests in former Teshendale .</p>
<p>Manshoon planned on capturing the Citadel of the Raven during the first days of the Zhentarim, though they were not powerful enough as an organization to openly attack a city of the Moonsea. While it was openly discussed for years, many senior members of the Zhentarim advocated against assaulting the city, fearful of losing their investments that funded the Black Network. Putting that scheme on hold, they greatly strengthened their economic holdings during the Moonsea War of Year of Thunder, 1306 DR . The allied forces of Zhentil Keep, Hillsfar , Melvaunt , Phlan and Sembia united together to defeat the city-state of Mulmaster .</p>
<h3>Growth</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Manshoon seized the fortress of Darkhold from the Lich -Queen Varalla in order to extend his control into the Western Heartlands . Four years later, they invaded and seized Teshendale in the Year of the Highmantle, 1336 DR .</p>
<p>They then conquered and installed their own rulers in Daggerdale in 1336 DR . Manshoon consolidated his rule over all Zhent lands and declared himself the High Lord of Zhentil Keep the following year . These actions caused the nations of the Moonsea to grow wary of the Zhentarim and Zhentil Keep.</p>
<p>Also that year, Manshoon granted the previously occupied Yûlash its independence, and maneuvered this act of "good will" to call a meeting of the rulers of the Moonsea in the neutral town of Elmwood . He called for a garrison to be established at the Citadel of the Raven to protect the greater Moonsea from a horde of orcs that was stirring further north. He "graciously" offered to move the recently evicted Zhentilar soldiers from Yûlash to the city, though this was merely part of a long-term scheme to take over the city.</p>
<p>The Zhentarim saw significant losses in the next few years when Jyordhan , puppet ruler of Shadowdale, was assassinated by Khelben Arunsun ; Xantriph was killed by the Knights of Myth Drannor ; and Malyk , the puppet ruler of Daggerdale, was killed by Randal Morn , leading to all-out civil war.</p>
<p>Despite their losses, the time was right in the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR for the Zhentarim to strike against their former allies in the Citadel of the Raven. They had their agents planted within the city kill as many as they could, using poison and magic. The orcs and Zhentilar poured into the city and claimed it for the Zhentarim. One of the few survivors within the Citadel was the mortally wounded Galauntar Hawkhelm , whose eventual death would lead to the formation of the Knights of the North .</p>
<h3>Banedeath</h3>
<p>During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Bane arrived in the Black Altar . He ordered his devoted priest Fzoul Chembryl and Manshoon's apprentice Sememmon to work together, much to their mutual displeasure, in an assault on the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in Shadowdale so that he could enter Morningdawn Hall . After the destruction of the Dark God's avatar , the newly ascended deity Cyric, who took on his divine portfolio, became the focus of worship for a great number of the members of the Zhentarim. Fzoul Chembryl and a few others maintained their faith, while some others converted to the veneration of Iyachtu Xvim , Bane's divine son.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the Zhentarim began their campaign to take control of a trade route that ran through the desert of Anauroch . They were initially rebuffed by the unified tribes of the Bedine, aided by the Harper agent Lander and an exiled sorceress known as Ruha .</p>
<p>The conflict between the opposing faiths embedded within the Zhentarim culminated in an event known as the Banedeath , which began on Marpenoth 30 , the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . Xeno Mirrormane , began a purge of all the remaining Banites within Zhentil Keep, eventually killing his brother and sparing none except for Fzoul Chembryl, due to his "special relationship" with Cyric. While the aid of the church of Cyric allowed Zhentil Keep to grow in power over the next few years, Manshoon realized that Cyric was no replacement for the calculating cunning and patience of Bane.</p>
<p>Over a period of six months in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Manshoon quietly and discreetly shifted resources and personnel from Zhentil Keep to the Citadel of the Raven, being distrustful of the impulsive Cyric and his inept clergy members. Fzoul Chembryl saw these actions and remained neutral, still bitter from his loss of influence as the High Priest of Bane.</p>
<h3>Cyrinishad</h3>
<p>Cyric was eventually undermined by a divine conspiracy involving High Lord Fzoul. The larger northern half of Zhentil Keep was left in ruins as a result. Some 1,500 Zhentilar and Zhentarim, many of whom were high-ranking officers, and all the orc troops fled the city.</p>
<h3>Manshoon Wars</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Fzoul and Lord Orgauth attacked and killed Manshoon. However, Manshoon lived on through clone bodies, many of whom fought and killed each other. Of these, one returned to the Zhentarim, conceded all leadership to Fzoul, and worked as an agent.</p>
<h3>Resurrection of Bane</h3>
<p>Bane was resurrected on Midwinter night in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>In the early morning hours of Nightal 16 , the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a Zhentarim army led by Scyllua Darkhope overran Shadowdale from the north. They were aided by the church of Shar and House Dhuurniv , who attacked the Twisted Tower from below. The Army of Myth Drannor was unable to respond as Zhentarim brigades to the east launched simultaneous attacks on several key elven fortifications.</p>
<p>A Zhent named Karne attempted to take over the Onyx Tower , but the plan ultimately failed.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Vindicated Warrior, 1383 DR , the Shadovar moved against Zhentil Keep during the Shadowbane War , razing it along with the Citadel of the Raven, killing both Fzoul and the final clone of Manshoon, leaving only Darkhold left.</p>
<h3>15 th century</h3>
<p>The Zhentarim was again taken over by the forces of Cyric, who engaged in battle with the forces of Bane. In the Year of the Dark Goddess, 1420 DR , an evil mage named Rezlus took over the Banites and attempted to conquer Daggerdale. He failed and the Banites fell with only the forces of Cyric remaining.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the Pereghost, the Zhentarim transitioned from a conquering force into a mercenary army that served others. As of 1489 DR , the Zhentarim were said to have greater numbers than ever before and had a reputation for service unlike any time in their history.</p>
<h3>Post–Second Sundering</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the Zhentarim sent an agent, the gnome assassin Jamna Gleamsilver , to investigate the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon, as they had been growing in power rather rapidly. They allied with several other factions, including those which would otherwise be enemies, to rise up against the Cult and Red Wizards' attempts to free the dragon god Tiamat .</p>
