<p>Mhoss , also known as the True Soul 26 , was an agent and a True Soul member of the Cult of the Absolute in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Agent Mhoss was an envoy tasked with recruiting orcs of the Trielta Hills into the Absolute 's fold. True Soul 26 was sent to the Ringfork Stronghold with an offer for Lord Heradd . However, the orcish guards of the fortress deemed the cultist envoy's presence as evidence of weakness and dismembered Mhoss. The envoy's death caused the cultists to re-think their strategy of co-opting orcs into their army.</p>
