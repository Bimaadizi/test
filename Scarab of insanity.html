<p>A scarab of insanity was a dangerous magical item that could be used to drive others mad.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A scarab seemed like a harmless piece of jewellery, such as a mundane amulet , brooch, or scarab.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When the scarab of insanity was displayed and the command word spoken, all other creatures within 20 feet of the bearer were potentially afflicted with (hopefully) temporary insanity for a minute or so, rendering them incapable of any coherent thought or reason, similar to a confusion spell.</p>
