<p>In the Heralds of Faerûn organization, Old Night was one of the High Heralds . The sign of Old Night was an ancient, broken bronze shield hung on the wide trunk of an oak tree, surrounded by oak leaves. This office was in charge of training the Heralds Pursuivant , including the "everchanging offices" of Green Shield and Gauntlet . Additionally, Old Night was the head librarian of Herald's Holdfast , the greatest repository of heraldic lore, genealogy, and historic documents of the primary sentient races in North Faerûn .</p>
<p>Ironically, Old Night was the most scholarly and reclusive of the High Heralds, and yet the most well known to the peoples of Faerûn because of the authority the office wielded over matters of heraldry and the Law of Arms . The public perception of Old Night was that of an ancient, powerful, benevolent wizard with a mercurial streak, but at least two of the office holders in the 14th century DR ( Farsyr and Shalara ) were rangers .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The rod of office was a crooked and rough wizard's staff made from the remains of a cracked bronze shield, crushed into the shape of a walking-stick. It could be used as a wand of paralyzation and had other powers known only to the High Heralds.</p>
