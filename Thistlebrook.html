<p>Thistlebrook was a green warder in Cormanthor in 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1221 DR , an elf druid ordered Thistlebrook to watch over the ruined tower of Talarith near the Moonsea area. It fulfilled its task well until 1373 DR, when the place was invaded by a drow party led by Varzek . It had no power to destroy them so it lurked around the area, hoping to find some allies to expel them.</p>
