<p>Al-Akara Mountains , also called the Mountains of Creation , were a prominent mountain range found in the heart of interior Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountain range ran for hundreds of miles roughly west to east, abutting the fertile Al-Sarif River valley near Huzuz in the west and passing southeast into the Cities of the Pantheon , effectively creating a border from the Cities of the Heart . A long arm of the mountains sprouted from its center, reaching north into the barren Genies' Anvil of the Haunted Lands .</p>
