<p>The Cold Wood was a forest on the edge of the Silver Marches . By about 1460 DR , the Moonwood had grown together with the Cold Wood and the larger forest was known as the Glimmerwood .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located between the Spine of the World , Rauvin Mountains , and Ice Mountains . A wild place, the Cold Wood was largely untouched by civilization; most woodcutters and homesteaders avoided it.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The forest was full of pine , birch , and spruce trees. Though the heights were covered almost exclusively by pines and spruces. In the winter time the snow was so deep the trees were often bent down.</p>
<p>Animals that could be found inhabiting the Cold Woods included brantas , dire bats , dire bears , dire wolves and mundane wolves , dire wolverines , elk , night hunters , red tigers , and sinisters . More fantastical and magical creatures included darkenbeasts , gray renders , gulguthydra , ibrandlin , perytons , phase spiders , snowcloaks , tall mouthers , unicorns , vargouilles , and worgs .</p>
<p>The Cold Wood was also haunted by a number of undead that included crawling claws , dread warriors , packs of ghasts and ghouls , shadows , spectres , wights , and wraiths .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1366 DR , a group of giant-killers known as the Blood Riders commonly operated out of this forest.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR , a number of green abishai and a bebilith could be found roaming the Cold Wood, though how they came to be there was a mystery.</p>
<p>In the years following 1486 DR , fire giants began moving through the eastern woods from Ironslag , using their fire and greatswords to clear wide swaths of the forest for expedited overland travel.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Sentient creatures that were known to roam the Cold Wood included ettins , orcs , green hags , tanarukka , treants , wild elves , and a variety of lycanthropes . Including werebats , werebears , and werewolves .</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR the Cold Wood was inhabited by an adult and clutch of green dragons , a juvenile red dragon , a juvenile song dragon , a young gold dragon , a young adult white dragon , and two dracoliches .</p>
<p>Uthgardt barbarians hunted in the area, but would not cut any living tree and kept fires to a minimum to protect the forest. The Red Tiger Tribe considered the southern part of the wood their territory. Several bands of outcasts from Uthgardt society were known to live around the area as well.</p>
