<p>Sultan Duncan el Ashnarti was the ruler of the city of Keltar in Calimshan as late as 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>Duncan Ashnarti (who often dropped the article in his name to sound more like a northerner ), was one of the richest men in Keltar, having made his money through connections in the horse -breeding, meat-packing, and shipping industries. He was the owner of a number of tanneries as well, which produced the cowhides used by the Tenassar Saddleworks .</p>
<h2>Rule</h2>
<p>As a ruler, Duncan was a relatively good leader with no need to rely on powerful supporters to keep him in office. He was receptive to input from his advisers, but he was the one in full control. He was proud of the peacefulness of his city.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>A key factor in Duncan's control of Keltar was in the fact that he was also the leader of its only significant crime syndicate, the el Ashnarti family, which maintained a guild of thugs and enforcers. Having married into the el Ahimar crime family, he also connected himself into one of the "four families" of Calimshan. Duncan considered the Kahmir clan his rivals.</p>
<p>Though ordinarily men in their positions would be rivals, Duncan was a decades-long friend of the ynamalik of the shanate surrounding Keltar, Uras el Ihak , and their friendship partly explained the peace of Keltar.</p>
