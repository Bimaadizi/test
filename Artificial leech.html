<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Artificial leeches bore a simple enchantment, similar to that of a +1 weapon that made it more deadly and easier to aim with. The device itself was used for bloodletting. It had mechanism that activated with a twist, sending the leech's needles spinning.</p>

<p>In the late 15 th century DR , several of the artificial leeches could be found in the House of Healing in Reithwin and in the hands of undead nurse Sister Geanne who served depraved Sharran surgeon Malus Thorm . Another such bloodletting tool belonged to the drow blood magic researcher Araj Oblodra who ran Crimson Draughts apothecary in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
