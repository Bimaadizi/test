<p>Donovan was a sailor and fisher from the town of Targos who lived sometime before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Those who knew Donovan in life said he had a thick skull but was a good person with a big heart. Others added that he liked to drink a bit too much at the The Salty Dog Tavern in the docks of Targos.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Donovan and his beloved Veira 's lives ended some years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . By some accords, Donovan sailed into Maer Dualdon after drinking a bit too much and soon after met his doom in a storm. Veira's heart was broken, and she hurled herself out of the window to the base of the cliff. Since then, the lake-facing room in the Weeping Widow Inn remained locked and unused, with Veira's ghost appearing and crying on the deepest nights.</p>
<p>Some said that her spirit found rest in 1312 DR, soon after a group of adventurers from Luskan found a broken carved prow from the skiff called Veira's Gaze that was displayed for several years at the Salty Dog Tavern where Donovan liked to drink.</p>
