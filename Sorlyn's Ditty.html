<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sorlyn Sheerla received the original and significantly more powerful version of Sorlyn's Ditty as a Midsummer gift. Being a teacher at a bardic college in Amn, she decided to order several dozen copies of the flute created to be given out to the best students as a gift of recognition. She quickly realized that creating an exact copy would be far too expensive, and the resulting copies were of significantly lesser power. Sorlyn Sheerla did not think that was much of an issue as she believed that any prize student of hers would keep out of trouble in any event.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one of Sorlyn's Ditties found its way into a wizardly cabal in the Tempest's Fury of Samarach .</p>
