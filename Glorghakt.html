<p>Glorghakt was a mind flayer envoy from Ryxyg in the Deep Wastes in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the illithids of Ryxyg discovered that the fire giants of Maerimydra had built devastating arcane siege engines that they were planning to use against Hillsfar and Elventree . However, the mind flayers also discovered a means to disable those engines in secret from afar.</p>
<p>Thus, Glorghakt asked to meet a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet in the myconid settlement of Sporedome . There, it explained that it wanted an adventuring party find and kill a rogue mind flayer warlock who'd allied itself with the demon lord Graz'zt and was hidden in a place full of madness-infected faerzress . In exchange, it offered to destroy the engines of the giants.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Glorghakt was driven by disturbing knowledge of both the surface world and the future. Only his closest confidants could use its full name. Glorghakt was very direct and matter-of-fact, never hiding information but only yielding it to those it deemed worthy.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Xicvizt and Glorghakt were spawned from the same pool.</p>
