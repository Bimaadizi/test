<p>Nine Paces was an enchanted polearm designed specifically for hunting arctic boars of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Apart from being an oaken spear , the runes on its haft allowed Nine Paces to strike at a one-third longer distance than an average weapon of the kind. The same carved symbols gave it a simple +1 wounding enchantment, guiding the hand of the wielder to strike true. However, its magics did not affect creatures that could only be harmed by enchanted weapons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The weapon was thought to originate from north Faerûn , judging by it being used for hunting white-furred arctic boars and the magical sigils engraved along the shaft, typical for the region. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Nine Paces belonged to the Gallaway Trade Depot . It was made available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her family's trading house in Targos .</p>
