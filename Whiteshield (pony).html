<p>The Whiteshield was a breed of war pony from the North that was favored among the region's shield dwarves .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ponies were quite large and possessed a dense musculature. They were exceptional at traversing mountainous terrain, and were strong enough to support the weight of a dwarf in full plate armor. They had thick and shaggy winter coats, which they shed in the hotter months, revealing a rough brown hide.</p>
<p>Whiteshield ponies earned their name from the shield -shaped patch of white hair that was found on the forehead of pure-breed specimens. Dwarven riders often tattooed or painted their personal heraldry upon this spot, distinguishing their mount from others.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>While these ponies were common within the dwarf holds of the North they were rarely made available to non-dwarves. If they were sold to outsiders, they fetched a hefty price of around 1000 gp .</p>
