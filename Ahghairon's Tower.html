<p>Ahghairon's Tower was the home and eventually the final resting place of Ahghairon , the first Open Lord of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Ahghairon's Tower was located in a courtyard at the intersection of the Street of Silks and Waterdeep Way in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A series of six barriers were put in place to prevent entry into the tower. To successfully gain entry to the tower, all wards required keys. Opening each barrier gave a limited amount of time to open the next, as each would reactivate after a short time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to song, Ahghairon slew five demons and closed a demonic portal during the Goreclipse . The tower was then constructed on the site of the portal.</p>
<p>Upon his death in the Year of the Dusty Throne, 1256 DR , the tower became his tomb. His nine apprentices warded the entire tower to prevent intruders from disturbing the first Open Lord's final resting place.</p>
<p>Only fifteen years later, in the Year of the Shattered Wall, 1271 DR , Melkar of Mirabar attempted to breach the tower's defenses. Thereafter, his skeleton hung outside of the tower as a warning to others who would try to breach the tower.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Khondar Naomal was nearly able to reach the inside of the tower, but was thwarted by the new Blackstaff , Vajra Safahr , and her allies.</p>
