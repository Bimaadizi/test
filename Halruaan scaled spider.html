<p>Halruaan scaled spider were a species of deadly spiders , unique to the nation of Halruaa in South Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These arachnids were as big as an adult human 's palm, larger and more aggressive than their mundane cousins. Unlike spiders of the natural world, these monstrosities had bodies covered in fine and incredibly tough scales. Their bulky armored appearance was deceiving as they could move with the speed of lightning..</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Halruaan scaled spiders were extremely aggressive magical creations of an unwitting wizard from Halruaa who was exiled after his spiders escaped into the wild. These magical beasts collected treasures, small enough to be dragged into their lairs. The spiders diligently guarded their diminutive treasure hordes. Very few individuals were brave or stupid enough to try to rob Halruaan scaled spiders as their venom was extremely potent and deadly. Unique to Halruaa, the spiders lived in its tropical warm and humid climate, oven nesting within hollows in the massive Halruaan bilboa trees . Scaled spiders' homes could be identified via thick webbings that covered entrances to their nests. These sprawling trees were big enough to support their own micro-ecosystems that included several types of spiders, including Halruaan glass, brightly-colored birds , tressyms , and starsnakes .</p>
