The Friendly Arm inn on the Sword Coast and the Nashkel Inn in Amn served Shadowdark for a single gold coin .</p>
<p>Jasper purchased a pitcher of Shadowdark for himself, Bortas , Rob , and Will at the Swamp Rat tavern in Ghars , Cormyr , on Eleint 17 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . It was the most expensive drink at the Swamp Rat. Among other places in Cormyr where one could buy a frothy tankard of Shadowdark was Marsember 's The Wight on a Waterdragon .</p>
