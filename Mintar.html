<p>Mintar was a large city-state in the Land of the Lions region of south Faerûn , on the northwestern shores of the Lake of Steam , that was conquered by a faction of the Church of Bane led by Teldorn Darkhope in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was connected to two roads, Darkhope's Road connecting it westward to the town of Kzelter and Tyrant's Road (renamed from "Coast Road", in reference to Teldorn) connecting it eastward to the city-state of Saelmur . Below the surface, the catacombs of Mintar connected more or less directly to the beholder city of Zokir in the Underdark .</p>
<p>Every spring, the fields around Mintar were flooded by the swelling waters of the River Mintar .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>From 1018 DR to circa 1150 DR , the city-state was a magocracy ruled by a cabal of wizards known as the Magelords of Mintar .</p>
<p>After the fall of the Magelords, the city-state became a monarchy. Its rulers were officially referred to by the title of Grand Murlistar. However, Calishites , as well as many outsiders and Mintaran commoners, would also use the titles satrap and sultan to refer to the ruler. Under the rulership of Teldorn Darkhope, who declared himself to be the "Dark Tyrant of Mintar", the city-state functioned as a theocratic dictatorship. Its theocracy was based around the Church of Bane, though for a time it had shifted to the Church of Iyachtu Xvim after it was revealed that they had in fact not been receiving their spells from a reborn Bane, with Teldorn declared the leader of its own Xvim sect. Prior to becoming a Xvimite, Teldorn's had a number of Xvimlar from Almraiven as part of his senior staff, with their leader Khalas el Doalmin having been working to influence Teldorn into embracing Iyachtu Xvim.</p>
<p>The other major power over the state was the Zhentarim . Originally an alliance forged by Fzoul Chembryl , Teldorn would later become a Zhent lord and had to report to Fzoul. It had representatives installed throughout the ruling church hierarchy and it was not uncommon to find Zhent banners being flown alongside those of the Banite army. The city even had two stone walk connections, both established by Fzoul himself. One connected the city to the Citadel of the Raven , the other to Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h3>Allegiances</h3>
<p>Mintar's other major ally was a group of beholders from the Alimir Hive that had been brought together by the elder orb Vaxall , who himself was another member of the Black Network.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Before its conquest by Banites, Mintar produced boats and ships, seafood, wagons , and wine . They were the primary shipbuilders of the region, cutting trees from the Thornwood and dragging the logs by animal teams to the River Mintar, where they would be left to float downstream to the dock ward of Mintar. All of these goods continued to be produced following the Banite takeover, but ceased to be exported, save to the Mintaran occupied village of Kzelter. The one product that continued to see some limited export outside the city was wine, particularly the Mintar Gold that was produced by the merchant Georborg Fireblade , though part of his profits still went towards the coffers of the Church of Bane.</p>
<p>Equipment shops were generally poorly stocked, as the Banites would purchase anything of use or value, though would only compensate merchants with just enough currency to keep them afloat. Slavery was largely frowned upon in the city, as was common among the cities in the Land of the Lions. The Banites didn't share this anti-slaving attitude and life for slaves in the city was harsh.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Prior to Mintar's takeover by the Banites, giant leech hunting was a popular sport among the Mintaran nobility. These leeches, which grew to the size of small rowboats , would be lured to the surface by dropping blood or raw meat into the water. Then the noble would spear the beast with a small, barbed harpoon . A long, violent struggle would ensue, eventually culminating in the giant leech's death.</p>
<h3>Festivals & Holidays</h3>
<p>Mintar was host to several fishing festivals that were held throughout every year. During these festivals, much notoriety was garnered by those nobiles who brought in the largest leeches. Besides fishing festivals, prior to Banite rule the city held a grand spring festival, simply known as the Celebration of Spring, to celebrate the receding of the River Mintar's annual floodwaters.</p>
<p>Teldorn would eventually instate his own holidays, some of them revolving around the city's gladiatorial arena, the Thunder Room .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city was the base of Knights of the Black Gauntlet , a Banite military order of crusaders and helmed horrors . Their numbers were swelled over time by mercenary warriors and wizards, recruited from all across south Faerûn, and indoctrinated by Darkhope with a special ritual involving dark promise spells and other magics. These mercenaries roamed the city, breaking up crowds and cracking down on all riots and attempts by the Mintaran militia to gather. The Mintaran forces were also known to use double-agents and spies to gather intel.</p>
<p>A special contingent of helmed horrors, the Doom Brigade , were created by Darkhope with the doom of Bane spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa -5100 DR , Mintar began life as one of many garrisoned fortresses that were established by the armies of the First Kingdom of Mir . Sometime in the 25 years following the Mirran army's defeat at the hands of Jhaamdath in −5032 DR , on the plains north of the tiny fishing town of Ankhapur , Mintar along with the other Mirran fortresses were overtaken by the Jhaamdathan army as they pushed the Mirrans all the way back to garrisons at Fort Saradush .</p>
<p>In −5007 DR , after a year long siege on their eastern fronts, the leaders of Mir and Coramshan came together for negotiations and came to the conclusion that only unification of their states would ensure survival against Jhaamdath. United under the rulership of Ukhar IV , the Coramshite-Mirran army unleashed a devastating counterattack against the Jhaamdathans and within two months pushed them all the way back to Saelmur. The fighting continued on into −5003 DR , with Jhaamdath losing Saelmur. Eventually a truce was reached between the two nations, with the promise that both would abandon any claims over the Land of the Lions, leaving Mintar and others in the region independent.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Enigma, 755 DR , Mintar was struck by the Crimson Death and lost 16% of its population from the plague.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , during a Rage of Dragons the blue great wyrm Iryklathagra was driven to attack Mintar. She battled with its defenders for nearly a month before returning to her lair, leaving the city in ruins and many local ships sunk. This would kick off the Eighth Age of Calimshan . Up until that conflict, a cabal of wizards known as the Magelords of Mintar had been vying for power in the shadows of the Mintaran government. With the devastation left by Iryklathagra, the few surviving Magelords arose as the city-state's new leaders, promising to protect the populace against any further attacks by dragons.</p>
<p>The Magelords of Mintar become engaged in a conflict with the Harpers on the Turmish coast circa 1150 DR , having been hired by Calishite merchants to eliminate their presence in south Faerûn. The Magelords would ultimately lose this conflict and chaos would ensue in the city-state.</p>
<p>Sometime later during that period, Ankhapur tried to convince Mintar and Saelmur to unite into a single country. However, these efforts failed for a multitude of regions, such as the general preference among Arnadens for local governance and independence, trade dis-agreements, and difficulties with defenses.</p>
<h3>Banite Coup</h3>
<p>In the wake of the Time of Troubles , Teldorn Darkhope, then a mid-ranking Banite and former adventurer that had settled in Mintar, was approached by the elder orb Vaxall under the polymorphed guise of a younger beholder with the assumed name of "Xavlal". Vaxall offered Darkhope an alliance with a group of beholders that it claimed to represent. Having prior to this received visions of conquest and reward while within the city's Banite temple (that were in actuality the work of Iyachtu Xvim under the guise of Bane), Darkhope was open to the idea and together the two forged a plan to sieze power in Mintar.</p>
<p>On Midwinter's Eve in 1362 DR , Teldorn Darkhope and small company of the Knights of the Black Gauntlet appeared in the Mintaran palace through a ghostly black hand and slayed Obril Alaekyn , his fiancee Fyriana Darkenstar , his Court Sorcerer Pyrax , and their guards. Their assassination was quick, though fairly brutal affair. That night anarchy filled the streets of Mintar, with riots breaking out and panicking mobs. At least one such mob blamed magic or mages in general for the Grand Murlistar's death and stormed the mansion-and-tower home of Kosmal Ontos .</p>
<p>Kosmal tried to calm the mob down and disperse it, leaving his apprentice Enthos Raziir in his secret summoning chamber with a marilith named Malatorna that they had conjured and trapped with greater planar binding . Unwilling to listen to reason the mob attacked the wizard, restrained him, and burnt him at the stake. Not long after Raziir discovered his master's smoldering remains on the street and in a panic took what he could from the tower before fleeing to Saelmur.</p>
<p>Over the next several days the black knights, backed up by twice the number of helmed horrors and their flameskull commanders, eliminated all opposition within Mintar – the churches, its two schools of swordsmanship, and the local thieves' guild , and anyone else that dared to openly disagree with the proclamations of Teldorn. They sacked and burned city's temples. Much of Mintar would burn down over the first few weeks of occupation. Though at first intentional, the damage grew out of the hands of the Banites as the fire spread.</p>
<p>Non-Banite priests were attacked, hunted down, and burned at the stake. Some managed to flee the city and lead other refugees to safety, fleeing eastward to the city-state of Saelmur. Other priests resolutely stayed and did their best to minister to Mintar's sick and homeless.</p>
<h3>Banite Rule</h3>
<p>After the major threats to his rule were eliminated, Teldorn went about recruiting mercenary forces from all across south Faerûn. The buildings that were destroyed from the fires during takeover would eventually be either rebuilt or replaced, providing the Mintaran army much needed space to house its troops, horses , and equipment.</p>
<p>In 1368 DR , a Mintaran troop on a wide patrol beyond the city-state under the guise of bandits or slavers encountered a small group of Ala-min . Feeling that the tribesmen were foraging too close to Mintar the troops attacked. Caliym Zalaster and his personal guards came across the scene and intervened, killing several of the troops and taking their heads, but in the process Zalaster was killed. Due to the disguises as bandits, Mintar's blame for the murder of the Ala-min leader went unknown.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR , the city was firmly under the iron rule of Teldorn Darkhope. On Uktar 20 , the powerful Banite tyrant Fzoul Chembryl was possessed by Iyachtu Xvim and given a vision urging him to head to Mintar as part of a holy quest. By stonewalking to various Banite and Xvimlar holy sites, Fzoul managed to travel from Mulmaster to Mintar over a period of 17 days. On Nightal 7 he arrived with great fanfare from the populace, but quickly went about meeting with Teldorn in private. Alone, Fzoul scarred Teldorn with the mark of Xvim , flooding his mind with visions from Xvim. At that moment Tendor realized that he had been receiving his powers and spells from the Baneson all along and converted to his church.</p>
<p>At dawn on Nightal 8 , Teldorn Darkhope addressed the masses and troops of Mintar, announcing their alliance with Fzoul Chembryl. Fzoul in head recognized Teldorn as the "Lord Knight Imperceptor of the Baneson" and the head of his own sect of the Church of Xvim.</p>
<p>By the end of 1369 DR, Mintar was mustering its forces for an invasion of Kzelter, a small and isolated town at the southern extent of Tethyr 's borders. There had long been local legends of an ancient stash of powerful magic, Tethyrian treasures, and weapons buried somewhere near or beneath Kzelter. Iyachtu Xvim confirmed the existence of this lost armory to Fzoul and Teldorn in the visions he provided, urging them to seek it out as a holy quest.</p>
<p>In the month of Uktar , the counts of the Tethyrian counties Mirkazar and Surkazar sent intelligence reports that suggested a buildup of troops and army movements in Mintar. In response, Tethyr sent a small contingent of troops to Kzelter.</p>
<p>From Nightal 10 to Nightal 26 , Teldorn and Fzoul managed to secretly ascertain the location of hidden armory beneath Kzelter and the nearby Plains of Pehrifaal . From the armory, Fzoul took eleven tyrant blades . With knowledge of the armory in their hands, the two went about planning the conquest of Kzelter in earnest, wanting to ensure their control over it. From relics taken from the armory, the two of them assembled the Scepter of the Tyrant's Eye as Xvim had commanded of them to do. Fzoul then returned to Zhentil Keep to construct a stone walk link between Mintar and Zhentil Keep.</p>
<p>In the month of Hammer , 1370 DR , the contingent of Tethyrian troops detected no activity from Mintar, their scouts and spies unable to even find the supposed amassed army. In response, the commander of the troops sent a request to Count Yuldar Llistiin for them to disband. Between Mirtul 8 and Mirtul 10 , a second instance of Fzoul Chembryl's Tyrantfog manifested around Mintar and from there spread northwest to Saradush. Finding themselves invigorated with new-found strength by the fog, at a time when Kzelter's local duke his two counts were away at the Tethyrian court in Darromar and the stationed army had their guards down, the Knights of the Black Gauntlet marched upon Kzelter.</p>
<p>The bulk of the troops surrounded the town under the cover of the Forest of Mir , the Thornwood, and the Qatarn Hills . Over the course of a three day siege, the small garrison fell to Mintar, leaving the beleaguered Tethyrian troops to route and flee north, regrouping at Ithal Pass .</p>
<p>In the month of Flamerule , Tethyr sent two thousand troops to their garrison town of Ithal Pass in anticipation of a further Mintaran advance, bolstering Tethyr's south. Around that same time, Mintar began sending caravans of troops and supplies north. Information on their movements would be leaked to both Tethyr and Calimshan, leading both nations to reinforce their eastern borders, though later intelligence reports showed little activity among the massed Mintaran forces. The nation of Saelmur would likewise beef up its defenses.</p>
<p>In Eleint the syl-pasha of Calimshan offered his aid to Tethyr and sent a token force to retake Kzelter. However, the syl-pasha was likewise interested in the legendary lost armory and ordered his troops that, should they free the town, to search for it before turning Kzelter over to the authorities.</p>
<p>In Uktar , Fzoul Chembryl constructed a stone walk site at the Citadel of the Raven, linking it to Mintar, then traveled to the city to congratulate Teldorn on his conquest of Kzeltar. Fzoul then stayed at Mintar for a tenday , enjoying the warmth of the Lake of Steam region.</p>
<p>Though Teldorn had desired to commit more military action that year, but was stymied back home by strikes, popular uprisings, and his ally Vaxall 's reluctance to advance further. Thus hostilities between Kzelter and Ithal Pass were few and far between, as the Tethyrians and Mintarans both focused their efforts towards refortifying and planning for the future. To Teldorn, the conquering of Kzelter was the first step in carving out a new empire in the name of Bane and schemed to one day conquer large portions of the Sword Coast South .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Teldorn and his forces were standing by, awaiting orders from Fzoul on what city to wage war against next. All the while, an underground resistance movement was brewing with Ilindyl Fireblade as its leader, sharing intel and resources with the underground resistance of Kzeltar.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , in the midst of Sammaster 's Rage of Dragons , the red great wyrm Balagos flew over the Land of the Lions and unleashed a firestorm in Mintar and Saelmur, killing over half of the population of both city-states.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR, rumors circulated around the cities of Ankhapur, Darromar, and Saelmur that Mintar was selling much of its imprisoned youth off into slavery. According to the rumors, this "conscription service" was being done in order to raise funds for to pay off the increasing numbers of mercenaries that were under Mintar's employ, mercenary forces that speculated as being amassed for battle against lthal Pass.</p>
<p>Around that same period rumors began to circulate around the Nagalands suggesting that Mintaran agents had uncovered a lost method for transforming water nagas into banelar nagas . The increasing presence of the latter within the Nagawater were speculated to be a result of this.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th century DR, the permanent residents of Mintar typically numbered around a minimum of 45,000, with the population exceeding 50,000 during the summer months. By 1370 DR, Banite tithing records estimated the population to be at 34,000 and to mostly consist of humans . By that time very few mages remained in the city and sages were nearly non-existent. Those that remained of both groups were largely those that served under Teldorn.</p>
<p>A resistance movement existed among the populace, referred to by some as the "Pursuers of Freedom" due to the central role of the Pursuers of Pure Knowledge , the Oghmanytes of Mintar that chose to remain in the city. They were dedicated to the cause of documenting everything that transpired in the city so that the Banites could one day be held accountable for their crimes, as well as hindering and impeding the efforts of the Banites.</p>
