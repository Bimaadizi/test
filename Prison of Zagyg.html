<p>The prison of Zagyg was a minor artifact created by the Oerthian wizard Zagyg Yragerne that could imprison almost any creature. It was widely believed that there were only five copies of the artifact in existence.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>All copies of the prison of Zagyg were nearly identical, having the appearance of a small, well-made brass birdcage , studded with gems and sporting a padlock that had the appearance of diamond . They weighed no more than 4 pounds (1,800 grams).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These artifacts were only usable by wizards and other arcane spellcasters .</p>
<p>Both the interior and exterior of a prison of Zagyg were constantly under the effect of permanent anti-magic and non-detection spells . The former effect caused any supernatural abilities, spell-like abilities, spells, and other magic possessed by a prisoner to not function within the cage. The latter effect made these cages and their prisoners impossible to locate by magical means, including by divinations of all sorts. If detect magic was ever cast upon a cage, the spell had only a 50% chance of detecting its magic, which was a strong abjuration dweomer . Otherwise, detect magic would either not discern what class of magic it was or give a false reading.</p>
<p>Additionally, any creature imprisoned within the confines of one of these cages was magically sustained, no longer requiring food or water.</p>
<p>Prisons of Zagyg were nearly impervious to damage, harm, or otherwise being affected by all manner of physical force or magic. However, each copy of the prison of Zagyg had its own weakness that could be exploited to cause its destruction. These methods were unknown, but guaranteed to be dangerous. If somehow one of these cages were destroyed, the creature imprisoned within them would be returned to their normal size. Alternatively, the spells alter reality or wish could be used to open a prison of Zagyg .</p>
<p>Operating a prison of Zagyg required attunement and knowledge of its four command words that activates it, though with tremendous expertise in the arcane a spellcaster could bypass the need for them. A prison of Zagyg would function only for those attuned to it, even if the appropriate command words were spoken. They could only be attuned to one creature at a time and upon changing ownership the previous owner was immediately made aware.</p>
<p>Each cage had own particular set of command words, separated into: activation , trigger or target , command spell or imprison , and freedom .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>The methods and materials needed to create a prison of Zagyg were unknown, lost with their creator, though some of Zagyg's tomes contained partial instructions on how to go about creating one.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Oerthian year of 318 CY, Zagyg led the Company of Seven on an expedition to find the lost ruins of Veralos. Within its depths the wizard discovered a prototype magical cage that would serve as the basis for his prison of Zagyg .</p>
