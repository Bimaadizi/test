<p>Karasuthra was the third and deepest layer of the Beastlands . A realm of perpetual night and home to dangerous predators, it contained the divine realm of Stronmaus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dominant celestial body in the layer was the moon Noctos , which absorbed the light that emanated from the plane's sun Selera and reflected part of it off its surface, providing the layer with a very dim silver moonlight. Noctos's phase changed extremely slowly. The countless stars of this realm drifted randomly across the heavens, moving unpredictably and baffling all attempts at understanding. Light sources such as torches , fires, and magical light were also considerably weakened while in the layer, giving off only about half of their nominal light and heat for only half of the normal duration. Nonmagical light only worked if brought from outside of the layers, and no new nonmagical light could be initiated there.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the Beastlands, this layer had no settlements.</p>
<h2>Cosmography</h2>
<p>Rumors existed of connections between Karasuthra and the Shadowfell . Shadow creatures were occasionally found in the layer, usually hiding from predators.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The layer's main natives were the mortai , who were present in the skies of the entire plane. A permanent contingent of at least one mortai was always present near Stormhold.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the plane, Karasuthra was inhabited primarily by natural beasts . The layer's most frequent inhabitants were noctunal animals such as owls and panthers . Despite the perpetual night, the layer had an extensive vegetation that provided food and cover for a variety of herbivore animals as well.</p>
