<h2>History</h2>
<p>Salander began his career in the Zhentarim as an apprentice to the archmage Olorim at the Citadel of the Raven . He would go on to serve the organization as a caravan guard in the Stonelands , until being stationed in the Darkhold .</p>
<p>In 1359 DR , Salander was living inside the town of Voonlar, tasked by his superiors with guarding a gate that had been recently constructed by Gauntather , then-leader of the Risen Cult of Bane , with aid from Manshoon . This gate was in a windowless, unfurnished room and it connected to the House of the Black Hand . Salander was stationed in a room adjacent to this one, while inside it was guarded by nine ju-ju zombies and two bonebats .</p>
<p>Salander was given very little information regarding purpose of his task. If the area were to get breached and the situation turn dire, he was instructed to allow a bonebat to escape so that it could report the situation to Zhentil Keep . If hounded by such intruders, he was to drink his potion of gaseous form , then retreat to the nearby Blushing Beauty inn and report to its innkeeper, Ralagas Therim .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Due due to something that transpired prior to 1359 DR, many within the Zhentarim considered Salander to be overly ambitious and deceitful. He was especially mistrusted by his fellow Zhentarim wizard Sememmon and he in turn harbored resentment towards him.</p>
