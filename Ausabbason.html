<p>Ausabbason was a sparsely-populated fishing hamlet on Cloak Bay , southwest of the Cloakwood , separated from the library fortress of Candlekeep by a perilous and rocky shore known as the Jaws .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ausabbason stood on Cloak Bay and the smaller Borlyth Bay's southeastern shore, sheltered by Cloakwood's edge, and south of the nameless rocky plateau that bordered the eastern side of Borlyth Bay. A wagon trail that curled southeast around the edge of Cloakwood connected Ausabbason to the Coast Way . By the 14 th century DR, Ausabbason was a collection of mostly abandoned single-store cottages reinforced with timber wood and scavenged marine wrecks. Those buildings that remained untouched by ruination and decay were the most defensible homes in Ausabbason.</p>
<p>The hamlet's inhabitants survived by salvaging and fishing in its natural harbor, netting for crabs , silverfins , and laethe , a species of eel -like creatures.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , Ausabbason, as well as other hamlets of Cape Raeth, were almost completely deserted, inhabited by very few hardy folks who lived on fishing and ship-salvage. At some point before the 14 th century DR, most inhabitants of the coastal hamlets fled from pirate raids and Cloakwood monster attacks.</p>
