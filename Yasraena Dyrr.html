<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Auro'pol's death, Yasraena was chosen by the Lichdrow to be matron mother.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , during the Silence of Lolth , House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the Jaezred Chaulssin , who had chosen that house because of its de facto male ruler, the Lichdrow Dyrr. In exchange for the assassination of Matron Mother Ghenni Tlabbar , they worked with Nimor Imphraezl to betray Menzoberranzan's Army of the Black Spider to the armies of Gracklstugh and Kaanyr Vhok . Nimor posed as Captain "Zhayemd" of House Agrach Dyrr in order to complete the deception. After the house's betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by House Xorlarrin and its allies. Gromph Baenre battled Lord Dyrr, destroying his corporeal form. Thus the defense of the house was for the first time truly in the hands of Yasraena and her daughters. However, Gromph infiltrated their compound in order to destroy the lich's phylactery . Destroying the phylactery activated the master ward, destroying the house temple and killing Yasraena.</p>
