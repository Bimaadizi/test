<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 229 DR , local Hastarl thieves Eladar and Farl hurled local coin-lass, Shandathe , into the bedchambers of the baker Hannibur through the second-story window to keep her safe from the forces of a local dandy that had purchased her services and then been thwarted. They took brief notice that he slept in women's lingerie. Afterwards, to their surprise, there had been no word of what happened after Shandathe woke up. Shandathe made it a point to return to his home on at least some nights, which they eavesdropped on at least once. They got married just about the same day on which the thief Eladar the Dark (actually Elminster) was going to leave Hastarl; he paid them a visit, and dropped gold coins between the two of them as they slept.</p>
<p>In 240 DR , the armsmen of King Belaur Aumar broke into his home to pull out his wife, Shandathe, to whom the king had seen and taken a fancy. They also knocked him out. During the siege that followed the arrival of the prince Elminster Aumar, come at the head of a force bent on ending the reign of Belaur and his Magelords of Athalantar , Hannibur snuck in through the tumult and managed to stab the Mage Royal Undarl Dragonrider from behind. After the prince slew King Belaur, and fainted, Hannibur picked up the Sword of the Stag , and used it to hold at bay the King's courtiers who meant to assassinate the prince, until the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn arrived at the throne room with his wife, Shandathe, and aided the prince.</p>
