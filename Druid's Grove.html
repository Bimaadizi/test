<p>Druid's Grove was a large clearing filled with standing stones in a rough circle located to the northwest just outside of the village limits of Shadowdale .</p>
<h2>Flora</h2>
<p>Oak trees surrounded the area around the Grove. Mistletoe grew quite heavily around the Grove.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Several druids stayed in the area and tended the Grove, though they kept themselves apart from the rest of the Shadowdale community. A more formal group of druids, known as the Circle , once tended the Grove. Shortly after 1358 DR the Circle moved on and left the Grove.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Druid's Grove had been a meeting place and a place of worship for druids for centuries before the 1300s DR. After the Spellplague , the Druid's Grove became known as a place of great primal power and it was sacred to the fey .</p>
