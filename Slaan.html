<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , while en route to sabotage ships in Highcliff , Slaan and his forces were attacked by undead from Highcliff Castle. After his troops fled deeper into the castle, Slaan was left fighting the undead alone. While fighting, Slaan encountered the Kalach-Cha, who helped fight off the undead. There are three possibilities when it comes to his later fate. Either the Kalach-Cha killed him and looted his body for a map to the lizardfolk cave where the attacks on ships were planned or, in exchange for helping his soldiers, Slaan led the Kalach-Cha to his chieftain for peace talks. It is also possible that Slaan was slain at the peace talks.</p>
