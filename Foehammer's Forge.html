<p>Foehammer's Forge was a renowned smithy found in the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR . Its proprietor was the dwarf master smith Ghelryn "Goldhand" Foehammer .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ghelryn produced a large quantity and variety of metalwork items that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast . The quality of his metal and his craftsmanship was above average, and his prices cheaper. In particular, his eyebolts , latches , nails , and pins were crucial to the success of Wainwright's Wagons and other wagon repairmen in town. He also forged armor and weapons . His work was recognized by the inlay on the hafts of his weapons. Notably, he forged the darksteel greataxe with telescoping haft that would come to be wielded by Holga Kilgore .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The forge was located in the north end of town, on the west side of the Long Road and across the way from Uldinath's Arms . Foehammer's and Uldinath's enjoyed a long-standing but amiable rivalry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Foehammer's Forge was well-established in Triboar by the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<p>By the late 1480s DR, Ghelryn was growing too old for day-to-day work and had begun looking for an apprentice, but could not find any who met his standards.</p>
<p>When Ghelryn fashioned fine suits of ceremonial armor for King Morinn and Queen Tithmel of Citadel Felbarr , they awarded him an honorary title as Royal Armorer. This strengthened the already strong reputation of Foehammer's Forge.</p>
