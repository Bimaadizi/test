<p>The Friendly Word was a holy slayer organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teaching of Zann , the Zakharan god of learning and intelligence.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>Though they did not use unique weapons, members of the Friendly Word left a pen-shaped dagger in the pillow of their target as a calling card and warning.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Holy slayers from this organization rarely committed murder, preferring instead to attack the reputation or station of their targets. They accomplished this by carefully researching their targets, spreading rumors, and destroying the wealth and holdings of their targets. Their favorite tactic was to create an accusation of which the target could only be proved innocent by confessing to some other crime or incriminating situation.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The stronghold for the Friendly Word was located within the Ghost Mountains northwest of Halwa .</p>
