<p>Omeluum was an illithid born with arcane powers that managed to escape the Grand Design of its designated elder brain . It managed to establish a life of independence, and became a member of the Society of Brilliance during its travels throughout the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite its disagreeable experiences within the illithid colony it had once been a part of, Omeluum had an appreciation for the lore and history of its people. Omeluum had a curious mind along with a drive to make the world a better place for others beyond itself.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fitting for a resident of the Underdark, Omeluum was a skilled alchemist . Using a tongue of madness fungus and timmask spores, Omeluum could brew a moderately-poisonous potion that could bypass the effects of magical stasis.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Omeluum owned a ring of psionic protection , an item that helped it evade the psionic influence of elder brains within the Underdark.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Omeluum was an associate of Lenore De Hurst , a Mystran cleric and scholar that dwelled within the Arcane Tower . It was friends with the orog (or possibly hobgoblin ) Blurg , who expressed concern for Omeluum's safety when it disappeared during its research into the altered tadpoles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike nearly all other illithids, Omeluum was born with sorcerous powers, granting it natural defenses against the psionic control the elder brain exerted over its colony. Omeluum resisted the elder brain's control and fled the colony before its disappearance could be found out.</p>
<p>For some time Omeluum traveled with a lich , bringing the undead spellcaster souls in exchange for brains to feed upon. Eventually their paths in life parted, and it became a founding member of the Society of Brilliance alongside Blurg , Grazilaxx , Sloopidoop , Y , and Skriss .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Omeluum was studying alongside Blurg at the Ebonlake Grotto . It sought an alternative to brains as a food source for its people, though its research was progressing slowly. They spoke with several adventurers who had been afflicted by tadpoles and bore a strange artifact . Omeluum was shocked to find that their tadpoles had been magically altered. It offered a number of different types of aid to the adventurers, though to no avail. In a comment to Blurg, Omeluum was overheard expressing astonishment and pondering the idea that its species could possibly be evolving.</p>
<p>Omeluum and Blurg later returned to Baldur's Gate . Intrigued by their encounter with the adventurers, Omeluum began deeper research into the altered tadpoles and eventually caught the attention of the Cult of the Absolute . Detained by Enver Gortash , Omeluum was brought as a prisoner to the Iron Throne headquarters , an underwater prison. Omeluum was one of several prisoners that might have been freed by the same adventurers bearing the altered tadpoles it had met in the Underdark, though Omeluum encouraged saving others before itself. After this, if Omeluum survived, it thanked the adventurers and returned to the Society. Alternatively, Omeluum may have been murdered by Ptaris , a githyanki hatched from an egg acquired by Lady Esther , whose development was magically accelerated as part of an experiment run by the Society.</p>
