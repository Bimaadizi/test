<p>Meldryn Jalensifer was the Magister from 986 DR to 998 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Meldryn came upon the idea to slay the previous Magister after looting a stronghold of the Cult of the Dragon northwest of the Vilhon Reach , discovering spells that could create skeletal dragons and zombie dragons . He lured Constulgrael to the Howling Caverns , where he had laid down zombie and skeleton dragons , and then struck the Magister with spells and summoned monsters when he appeared. Eventually, Meldryn slew the dragon.</p>
<p>Once he had the office of the Magister, Meldryn created a number of constructs to speak for him, dedicating all of his time to hiding and misdirecting mages who sought to challenge him. Even though Mystra pointedly gave him the scepter of Mystra in 994 DR with orders to give it to a minor mage, he performed that action and immediately returned to hiding. Mystra reminded him in dreams and visions that the Magister was supposed to spread magic; in response, he wrote down dozens of copies of Jalensifer's Trident and went on a whirlwind tour to spread them.</p>
<p>He was eventually ambushed in his hidden lair in the Star Mounts by a challenger, but rather than attack, he responded with visible relief, and asked only for a few days in order to explain his situation at leisure instead of running and hiding. Though suspicious, his challenger accepted. A few days later, Sarndaen Dalabar , the challenger, slew the Magister with three meteor swarms in quick succession, just to make sure.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Meldryn's ability to stay undetected was excellent, leading some to suspect a psionic wild talent was involved.</p>
