<p>Peela Crivens was one of the inhabitants of Reithwin , the town that once venerated Selûne in the Western Heartlands , sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Peela Crivens perished in a tragic event sometime before the fall of Reithwin, before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , and before it was consumed by the Shadow-cursed Lands . The event took the lives of Peela, Brent , and almost every member of the Crivens clan, including the family dog – Patch , outlived only by Errick Crivens , who was, in some way, the cause of the tragedy. Peela was buried in Reithwin's graveyard behind the House of Healing in a cluster surrounded by the graves of her family. Her tombstone read: "Dedicated to Peela Crivens, taken along with her family on the same grim night. May their deaths be avenged." The Crivens family's grave markers remained relatively undamaged and legible as of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
