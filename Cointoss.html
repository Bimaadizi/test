<h2>Location</h2>

<p>It was poorly lit and unremarkable, just as Yartarrans preferred.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tavern's owner, Tanataskar Moonwind was once an cocky adventurer and a devout follower of Tempus . On one occasion, his pride got the better of him and Tempus took offense. The deity cursed Tanataskar to fly into an uncontrollable rage whenever he shed the blood of another.</p>
<p>Not wanting to hurt any companions or innocents, the devout warrior retired to run the Cointoss in Yartar. He was always eager to hear stories and adventures from his fellow Yartarrans.</p>
