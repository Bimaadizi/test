<p>The shrine of Torm near Shadowdale was a small stone temple with a thatched roof, that had Torm 's holy symbol carved in the facade above the southeastern-facing doorway.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The granite building was surrounded by a colorful, sweetly fragrant flowerbed, and was tended weekly by local druids . About twenty feet (six meters) east from the temple was a tall oak tree, that provided total shade for the structure. Enchantments on the building kept the inside of the building comfortable at any time of year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shrine itself was erected in 1359 DR by the local faithful of Torm as a means to provide safety for the many travelers entering Shadowdale. They imbued the building with its protective magic. Not long after, druids of Chauntea passing by thought it looked bare and planted the flowers and oak tree, which was expedited by their magic , specifically the plant growth spell .</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>Anyone attempting to vandalize, or defile the shrine were permanently blinded until they personally fixed the damage for which they were responsible. Also, anyone attempting to pick more than a couple flowers from the garden became entangled as per the spell . Lastly, any attempt to chop down or destroy the oak tree caused it to reveal itself as an angry treant .</p>
<p>The shrine was a haven to any who stayed inside, offering protection from local wildlife and beasts.</p>
<p>Although it was not known to all, this temple was actually a symbol of the partnership of natural divine powers. The shrine itself was a place of worship for four different deities: Torm, Chauntea, Silvanus and Mielikki . Each of these divine powers were represented in some way. Torm by the stout building, Chauntea by the beautiful flowerbed, Silvanus by the protective oak tree and Mielikki by the vengeful treant.</p>
