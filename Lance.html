<p>A lances were a long member of the spear family of polearms , specially designed for use in mounted combat.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The design of these spears varied between cultures, but they generally consisted of a long shaft made of tough wood with an iron head shaped like a laurel . These spearheads had cutting edges and a sharp point meant to penetrate armor . Also fitted to the shaft, just behind where a wielder would grip the lance, was the "graper" — a thick leather ring that acted as a stop against the wielder's armpit. This was meant to halt any rearward momentum brought about by impacts.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Lances were meant to be aimed diagonally above a mount's neck and gripped close to their bottom end, the latter of which was meant to put a great distance between their wielder and a target. Is aimed diagonally above the horse's neck. A lance relied in part upon the weight and speed of a wielder's mount to effectively penetrate a target. If a lance was too heavy for the mount being ridden upon, its effectiveness would be reduced.</p>
<p>Without the aid of stirrups , a lance had to be wielded with two hands and it was generally impossible be couched for a charge. Prior to the invention of stirrups, lancers fought by stabbing overhand or even throwing the weapon.</p>
<p>It was common for lances to be tossed aside once their wielder became engaged in close quarters combat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1300 NY (−2559 DR) , the lance was first adopted by many cultures on Toril . The adoption of lances as mounted weaponry was directly linked to the adoption of stirrups many years prior.</p>
<p>In 1360 DR , in the Battle of the Fissures , the Bedine fought against the asabi with lances.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , one could find some fighters in the Sword Coast North wielding lances that were made from titansteel .</p>
<h2>Varieties of Lances</h2>
<p>Lances were divided into three classes of size and weight, designating what kind of mounts they were suitable to be used with — light, medium, and heavy. For example, light warhorses could only handle light lances.</p>
<p>Each lance was heavier and longer than the last. Measuring 10 ft (3 m), 12 ft (3.7 m), and 14 ft (4.3 m) in length respectively; weighing around 5 lb (2.3 kg), 10 lb (4.5 kg), and 15 lb (6.8 kg) respectively.</p>
