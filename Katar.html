<p>A katar was a punching dagger common to Calimshan and Zakhara , the Land of Fate .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The word for "knife" in Alzhedo was katar , yet when most people used the term "katar", they were referring specifically to the punching dagger used by Calishites .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A katar was a dagger with an H-shaped handle, two parallel metals bars that held a crossbar grip at an angle perpendicular to the length of the triangular blade. These blades were grounded to an edge on either side.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Katars were held in a clenched fist, facing away from a user's knuckles, and typically used for either stabbing or slashing an opponent. However, the former was the more common method among its users. It put more force from one's punch behind it, making it capable of deadly attacks.</p>
<h2>Notable Users</h2>
