<p>Wanderfen was a small village in the Mere of Dead Men , just south of West Harbor that ended its existence in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wanderfen had little history of note. The village was taken back by the Mere sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . One of the village's refugees was a cleric of Chauntea named Goodwife Aruna who resettled in the nearby hamlet of West Harbor. The hamlet lost most of its scant inhabitants to the creatures unleashed by the King of Shadows , while other were dragged away by the wandering undead of the swamp.</p>
