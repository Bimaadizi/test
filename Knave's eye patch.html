<p>A knave's eye patch was a magic eye patch that granted its wearer a number of benefits. It was particularly effective when worn by drow and other creatures that were sensitive to sunlight .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While attuned to the knave's eye patch , the wearer gained a magically enhanced eyesight, becoming able to discern more minute details within their field of view. It also shielded the wearer's mind, effectively blocking any magic that could read thoughts and even blocking unwanted telepathic communication.</p>
<p>The eye patch also made it easier for creatures that were overly sensitive to sunlight―such as drow, driders , duergar , kobolds , kuo-toa , and troglodytes ―to withstand it. Such creatures suffered no ill effects from exposure to sunlight while wearing a knave's eye patch .</p>
