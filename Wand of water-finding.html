<p>A wand of water-finding was an enchanted wand that would alert the wielder to nearby water.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When activated, this wand would vibrate if potable water was within 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the wielder. The intensity of the wand's vibrations would increase the closer the wielder came to the source of water. Additionally, the wand could shoot a beam of energy into the earth and draw water to the wielder from depths up to 500 feet (150 meters).</p>
