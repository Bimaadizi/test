<p>Zeldazar Street was the street that formed the western border of the Pumpside neighborhood in the Southside District of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Zeldazar Street began at the Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility , where it met with Red Sails Way . Unlike the streets that ran parallel to Zeldazar, it did not stretch to the Fire River , being cut short by one city block. From there, Zeldazar ran in a straight line south, crossing Drover's Run , Conant Court , Grismort Lane (which ended at Zeldazar Street), and ended at Stonekeep End , where rooming houses stood at the border with a forested area. Samarglast Lane formed a moot with Zeldazar and Stonekeep End where Zeldazar came to an end.</p>
