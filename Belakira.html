<h2>History</h2>
<p>As reported by the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter broadsheet in Uktar - Nightal of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , , Ambassador Belakira filed an official complaint with the governing body of Ravens Bluff of an attack on the nation of Thay, perpetrated by an adventurer or a group of adventurers from the City of Ravens. The charges included a number of murdered Red Wizards of Thay. An eyewitness fingered a man that resembled Lord Lorien Darkarrow of Ravens Bluff, disguised as a Red Wizard, who was one of the accused perpetrators; however, the evidence was scant and unreliable. Ambassador Belakira gave a detailed interview about the accusation to Armond Arhesian of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter . The accusation was handled boldly by Mayor Thoden of Ravens Bluff, who presented a list of Thayan "Lords" who committed crimes in the City of Ravens, including murder, but were untouched by the law but to diplomatic immunity. On top of that, Lorien Darkarrow provided the law with an alibi. He was badly hurt by a black dragon 's acid and teeth, allegedly, with the bodily wounds to prove it.</p>
<p>Ambassador Belakira appeared on the pages of Ravens Bluff Trumpeter once more in Mirtul of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . Journalist Guido of the Trumpeter reported on the murder of Dart Leftwin , one of the leaders of Port Disciples , a group that was said to have had affiliations with the Red Wizards. To this, Ambassador Belakira responded with a statement that these allegations were unproven and baseless as Thayan would never work with such "rabble," calming that if they indeed were Thayans, they were just renegades.</p>
