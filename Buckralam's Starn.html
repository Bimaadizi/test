<p>Buckralam's Starn , briefly Fox's Starn , was a small town somewhere in Faerûn in the mid–8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Buckralam's Starn lay in a vale, the Starn , where the river Larrauden crossed the Gar's Road .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The townsfolk were reported to herd sheep and produce cloaks from their wool .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Around 755 DR , the Iron Fox , a bandit, had taken over the town.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Before the Iron Fox, the town was home to Taver's Talons , an adventuring band.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Taver's Talons rode frequently through town until around 753 DR , the year they were all slain by a dragon . Afterwards, the town was taken over by the Iron Fox, who took the Shrine of the Sheaf as his own "Fox Tower", published a code of laws, renamed the town to Fox's Starn, and claimed the land around it to be the Realm of the Fox . He was in turn slain by Elminster Aumar in the Year of Laughter, 761 DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The Iron Fox's men spread vile rumors about Taver's Talons, including that they were fiends in human form, or scouts from a bandit kingdom.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The town had a tavern, the Trough and Plough , and boasted a small market, known simply as the Market; during the Iron Fox's rule, people were flogged in the market over minor transgressions. The local shrine to Chauntea was called the Shrine of the Sheaf .</p>
