<p>Melkar of Mirabar was a mage who tried to breach the protections around Ahghairon's Tower in 1271 DR (although his identity was not public knowledge). He failed, having misjudged the number of keys needed by half. His skeleton remained hanging inside the protections as a warning.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Melkar's journal was retrieved by Samark "the Blackstaff" Dhanzscul from the tomb of Khelben Arunsun . It fell into the hands of Samark's killers, Khondar and Centiv Naomal , who used it to determine the number of keys needed to enter the tower.</p>
