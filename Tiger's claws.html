<p>Tiger's claws (also seen as tiger claws ) were the favored weapon of the Red Tiger tribe of the Uthgardt barbarians in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This three-bladed dagger had very sharp, thin stone blades—either all of one piece or separate blades mounted on a short wooden handle —that were held projecting between the fingers to look like animal claws. One of these weapons weighed 2 lb (0.9 kg). Because these weapons were special to the tribe, it was very unlikely they would give or sell one, but if one found its way to a market, the typical price was 1 gp .</p>
<p>Some clerics of the Red Tiger tribe could craft magical tiger's claws for their warriors and did so before major conflicts, especially battles with orcs , their most hated enemy.</p>
