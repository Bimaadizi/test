<p>Dordrien was a ruined settlement in the western Dagger Hills in Daggerdale . It was founded by a Jhaamdathan noble whom the settlement was named after.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the destruction of Jhaamdath in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR , Dordrien led the survivors of Jhaamdath north from the Twelve Cities of the Sword in the Year of Black Apples, −251 DR . In the area later known as Daggerdale , the Dordrien Lords raised a sizable keep on the western slope of the Dagger Hills , which guarded a large and prosperous town nearby. Flourishing for a century or so the realm was weakened by continual orc raids and the decline of its ruling family. Eventually most of its folk drifted back to the more populated lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars . By −75 DR the town was abandoned.</p>
<p>Few traces remained by the 14 th century DR to indicate any settlement existed prior to the Dalesfolk. However, the crumbling foundations of Dordrien Keep lay on a barren hilltop, and the crypts of the Dordrien family could be found 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) north of the ruins.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>The Dordrien Crypts</h3>
<p>These crypts were built into the limestone caverns beneath the Dagger Hills, leading to three elaborate vaults carved from the rock. Two impressive stone mausoleums stood for many years outside. A handful of other mausoleums did not fare so well; over many years homesteaders hauled off most of the fallen stones. The natural caverns here led to the drow outpost of Szith Morcane in the upperdark . Drow refugees from the destroyed city of Maerimydra , circa 1372 DR , had been using these crypts as a staging ground for raids on the surface. These raids were ended by adventurers enlisted by Randal Morn .</p>
<p>The crypts were home to numerous undead Jhaamdathan nobles, plus a nest of bebiliths summoned by the drow wizard Solom Ned'razak , Archmage of Szith Morcane.</p>
