<p>Karl Chisolm was a boy at the family-run Downunda Patisserie in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of Jemima and Arvend Chisolm , and the younger brother of Allison and Derek .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As the youngest child, Karl was spoiled by his mother, brother, and sister. He of course enjoyed it, but tended to love his family more for what they did for him, than for them themselves. He wanted to be a great hero when he grew up, perhaps as a cleric for any god that would have him, and as much as his mother disapproved of adventurers, she figured he'd grow out of it.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At age 13, Karl stood 5 feet and 5 inches (1.7 meters) and weighed 143 pounds (64.9 kilograms). He had jet-black hair and eyes of a piercing gray hue. His mother rationed him and his siblings to only three of the bakery's smaller cakes a week to prevent them putting on weight.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Karl went to a school in Ravens Bluff and worked hard on his lessons. When he was older and left school, his mother might let him join an appropriate temple (she hoped he would become a cloistered cleric), or else he would begin work in the bakery. Until then, he was too young to be trusted with all the sweet things to eat and was not expected to help out.</p>
<p>His main interest in his spare time was playing a game called Papers and Paychecks with his friends.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When his father Arvend was executed for murder and all the family's belongings seized, leaving them destitute and ashamed, Allison left with her family to build a new life. They arrived in Ravens Bluff and purchased the bakery.</p>
