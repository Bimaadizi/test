<p>Artmaster Rhydwych Bourmay was the leader of the Lordly Wands contingent of the Swords of Evereska as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mage had black hair and thin eyebrows that granted expression to her otherwise elven visage.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was subordinate to Blademajor Aubric Nihmedu , leader of the Evereskan noble militia. While they disagreed at times, they maintained respect for one another along with the chain of command within the Swords.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Nightal 30 in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Rhydwych and Aubric led the Swords against nearly a dozen phaerimm and their minions during the early skirmishes against the aberrant creatures. They navigated through the Blazevale towards Rocnest to aid the elves defending from within. During their trek across the battlefield, Rhydwych had her Wands set up regular shields that protected their forces from the eye rays of phaerimm-controlled beholders .</p>
<p>They soon learned that the elven high mages within Rocnest were setting up a large portal to bypass the Deadwall the phaerimm established around the Shaeradim , to allow the relief army of Waterdeep to aid Evereska's forces. The two led a valiant assault against overwhelming odds and helped buy the high mages enough time until the chosen of Mystra Khelben Arunsun could destroy the phaerimm with Mystra's silver fire .</p>
