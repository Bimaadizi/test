<p>Mount Hotenow ( pronounced : /ˈ h oʊ ɛ t ɛ ˈ n aʊ / HOE-teh-NOW ) known to the ancient dwarves as Glaurimm , was a volcano amid the Crags mountain range, situated to the northeast of the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North , deep in Neverwinter Wood . It was home to a large population of fire elementals , warming the Neverwinter River to the point where it never froze over, even in the heart of winter, giving the city its name.</p>
<p>A shadowy reflection of Mount Hotenow also existed in the Shadowfell . Unlike its Torilian counterpart, the Mount Hotenow of the Shadowfell was always spilling rivers of lava, which flowed to the city of Evernight .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prior to its eruption, Mount Hotenow was described as a twin-peaked mountain, with the taller peak standing south-southeast of the shorter one. Both were barren of trees following some great fire in the past that had allowed the top soil to erode away.</p>
<p>After its eruption, the lower peak was gone and the rock of the mountain was shattered. Mount Hotenow looked like a set of serrated teeth that many described as a "door to the Nine Hells " (or the Elemental Chaos , according to others). A river made of pure elemental fire followed a serpentine path throughout Hotenow's interior and underneath the surrounding mountains and hills of the Crags.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Within Mount Hotenow were largely untapped deposits of alum , nitre , and sal ammoniac . Following the eruption, deposits of rare black diamonds were found in the crater's rim.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The volcano also had a tendency to attract creatures like fire giants and red dragons to make their homes near it.</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague of 1385 DR , creatures that could be found within Mount Hotenow included bloodfire oozes , fire archons , fire bats , fire beetles , galeb duhrs , flamespiders , geonids , magma beasts , salamanders , volcanic dragons , and xorn , while on its slopes could be found elemental weevils .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Since Neverwinter‘s founding, Mount Hotenow had long been a majestic landmark that featured in the bedtime stories and urban legends of the city's inhabitants as the home of fire giants , the fearsome red dragon Karrundax , and many other blazing beasts.</p>
<p>In the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR , a small adventuring party rediscovered the ancient dwarven city of Gauntlgrym beneath the volcano. The party, consisting of Dahlia Sin'felle , Korvin Dor'crae , Valindra Shadowmantle , Athrogate , and Jarlaxle Baenre , made it all the way to the legendary forges. There, the latter two were betrayed by their Thayan allies, with Athrogate hypnotically forced to activate the forge. This briefly awoke the primordial Maegera , who, in a fit of rage, released a burst of energy so powerful that it forced the eruption of the volcano . The resulting earthquake and combination of smoke and lava destroyed much of Neverwinter, killing thousands. The eruption entirely destroyed the settlement of Thundertree .</p>
<p>Over the next few decades the Cult of Maegera led by the mad fire giant Gommoth emerged within Mount Hotenow, attracting many of its fire-worshiping denizens. Having felt a shared "rapturous awakening" during the volcano's eruption they sought to re-awaken Maegera from her slumber once again.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a dwarven expedition led by Vandra Hillborn ventured into Mount Hotenow in hopes of finding an entrance to Gauntlgrym.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Mount Hotenow nearly erupted again due to the activities of Orn , a fire giant who tried to create a dragon-slaying weapon using its magma river. Due to the actions of a band of adventurers, the eruption did not occur. Mount Hotenow had a minor eruption again in the late 1490s DR, when Edgin Darvis and Holga Kilgore happened to ride past on their way south to Neverwinter.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Throughout recorded history, there had been many legends surrounding Mount Hotenow. Some believed that it sat atop a passage to the Nine Hells or a gateway to the Elemental Chaos . Others claimed that it had a secret entrance to Gauntlgrym. Following the Spellplague, in Neverwinter and Helm's Hold , there was an oft-told tale that suggested anyone who dared to enter its caves was to become cursed to die in a fire within one year.</p>
