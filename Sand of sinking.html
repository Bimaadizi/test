<p>Sand of sinking was a magical sand that turned other sand , earth, or stone into quicksand .</p>
<p>This sand originated in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When thrown upon any other type of sand, earth, and even stone, sand of sinking transformed the area into deadly quicksand. A handful of sand of sinking was capable of transforming a 9 ft (2.7 m) by 9 ft (2.7 m) square for 2-8 minutes. Additional handfuls did not increase the depth, but did increase the effected area. Anyone caught within this area began to sink instantly to a maximum depth of 10 feet (3 meters). Anyone stuck within the area when the magic wore off was in for a nasty surprise since the effected area solidified into its original state.</p>
<p>If used upon a wall, sand of sinking behaved similar to a passwall spell, creating a 10‑foot (3‑meter) deep opening. Openings created in this manner were permanent since the quicksand flowed downward away from the opening.</p>
