<p>The Fishyard was the bustling central marketplace of Yartar .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located immediately in front of the Waterbaron's Hall , in the center of several notable shops, inns and other establishments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The marketplace comprised a large collection of stalls, arranged in what seemed to be an unorganized maze.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Merchants and vendors sold a wide-variety of goods in the Fishyard. Appropriately enough, fresh fish and crustaceans caught in the Three Rivers were always available, even during the freezing winter months. Many types of seafood were sold, including catfish , coldwater crabs , eels , and shalass .</p>
<p>A number of folks sold baubles and curio from foreign lands; including jewelry, potions and even spellcasting components , from as far away as Calimshan or Mulhorand .</p>
