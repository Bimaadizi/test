<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tharchion Willeth Lionson was selected by the Council of Zulkirs to oversee the Thayvian gold mines with Maligor's help but remained unaffiliated with individual zulkirs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1362 DR , Willeth Lionson was captured by Maligor , the Zulkir of Transmutation as a part of the wizard's plot to usurp control over Thay. The Red Wizard's gnolls captured Willeth on his way to Tantras to purchase new mining equipment. His scheduled two-week absence gave Maligor time to carry out his scheme.</p>
<p>Captured Willeth was tortured and, under the influence of the friends spell, ended up revealing all the information the Red Wizard was after. He disclosed the locations of traps, the mines' defenses, and the daily production of gold , as well as the newly discovered abundant new vein. Taking control over Thay's gold was fundamental for Maligor's plan. He planned on using his horde of darkenbeasts to take over the mines and putting his trusted assistant Asp in charge.</p>
<p>After Willeth's usefulness ended, Maligor fed the tortured man to his gnoll friends. Afterward, he assembling the bones and clothes that were left behind into a sack to be secured to prevent his opponents using magic to communicate with the dead.</p>
