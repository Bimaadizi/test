<p>Corin Ithal was a chieftain of Clan Ithal during the First Age of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Chief Corin was half-brother to Tethyr 's first king, Darrom Ithal . They were both sons of Clovis II by different mothers.</p>
<p>Corin, like his half-brother, married an elven woman, named Shyllisyrr , and they had a half-elven daughter named Varytha , among other children.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A child of his father's old age, Corin was born in the same year that his father was killed by a swarm of arrows in the Ithmong Slaughter of the Year of Shambling Shadows, −221 DR . His older brother by sixteen years would go on to win that battle and retake the town of Ithmong for the Tethyrian tribes.</p>
<p>When Darrom was later crowned King of Tethyr by the clans in the Year of High Thrones, −212 DR , Darrom stepped down from his role as chieftain of Clan Ithal and passed the position to Corin. Corin, however, was only eight or nine years old at the time, so Darrom continued to serve as Chief Regent until −206 DR , when Corin came of age.</p>
<p>In −190 DR , Corin and Shyllisyrr's daughter Varytha vanished, and neither rangers nor mages could track her whereabouts.</p>
<p>In −189 DR , Corin's wife was killed by a snake bite while on a picnic with their remaining children. The elves of her tribe demanded that the family's guard be executed for not protecting her from the snake, but Corin refused to honor their request, believing the man to be innocent of any wrongdoing. After six years of tense diplomacy with the elves, King Darrom finally turned the elderly fellow clansman over to the elves, in hopes that this would serve to maintain the alliance with the clans and the elves. However, it caused the other human clans to turn against Clan Ithal.</p>
