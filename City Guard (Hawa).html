<p>The City Guard of Hawa was tasked with keeping order in the "City of Chaos."</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>As of 1367Â DR , there were 2,000 soldiers in the city guard and 15 ships in Hawa's navy. However, these numbers were greatly misleading considering that every landholder in the city had a contingent of personal guards, some of which were small armies by themselves. An estimated half of the city would be armed and ready for combat if Hawa was threatened with invasion. Additionally, each of the corsair Captains of the Corsair Council owned a ship with an elite crew with plenty of tricks up their sleeves.</p>
