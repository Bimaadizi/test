<p>Domincus was an Amnian bishop of Helm in the mid-14 th century DR and a member of Cordell 's Maztican expedition in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He tended to be arrogant and self-righteous, coming of as dour and intolerant, and as such was not well liked by the rest of the expedition. When something gained his interest he would be near fanatical about it.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wore a pair of gauntlets painted with the all-seeing eye of Helm , and a helmet that caused awe in enemies during battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He took his daughter, Martine , on the voyage and when she was sacrificed by the natives of Payit he demanded retribution. Domincus's thirst for vengeance led to a short war between the Golden Legion and Payit. The Legion easily won and claimed the Payit capital of Ulatos as a spoil of war.</p>
<p>Domincus was captured by Nexalans during the Golden Legion's retreat from Nexal and was sacrificed to Zaltec .</p>
