<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>House Thann were closely allied with the Tethyrian royal house and were engaged in the Reclamation of Tethyr . The family, originally based in Waterdeep, had actually split into two and the other branch of the family was based in Tethyr.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Thann was originally a Velenese family that made its fortunes in the slave trade by taking slaves from the Port of Shadow to the south. In 1315 DR , Rhammas convinced his father, Erktos Thann , to abandon the slave trade. They then began focusing on land holdings, wine, and shipping. They continued some work in less reputable trades, however.</p>
<p>In the 1360s and 70s DR, the family gained the ire of the Shadow Thieves through their ties to Lhestyn Silmaeril Arunsun and their involvement in Riatavin 's secession to Tethyr. The Shadow Thieves were known to attack Thann holdings within the city of Waterdeep itself.</p>
