<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Zita was employed by Baldur's Mouth and could be found outside the broadsheet publisher's office backing issues for delivery. She personally stopped reading the paper due to the sharply declined quality of reporting and Lord Gortash 's propaganda. She also was used to hearing complaints about the broadsheet's contents and simply sent everyone into the offices to talk to the editor-in-chief instead.</p>
