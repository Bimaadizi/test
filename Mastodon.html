<p>A mastodon was an ancient relative of the elephant and the mammoth that had a long pair of tusks. They were generally greater in length than those of modern elephants.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mastodons stood about 10 feet (3 meters) tall at the shoulder and weighed more than 4,000 pounds (1,800 kilograms). Though their attributes differed based on their natural habitat, they were generally longer in length and hairier than elephants. Their tusks grew up to 12​ to ​15 feet (3.7​ to ​4.6 meters) long, almost as long as their bodies. In cold climates, mastodon species grew long, shaggy fur, but those in snowy environments had shorter tusks.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other elephants and their ancestors, these rare animals were semi-intelligent.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were much more ferocious and aggressive than their elephant relatives.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Mastodons usually charged their opponents in combat, throwing their weight behind their attacks. Their foes were also met with a long and powerful set of tusks, meaning they could attack opponents from range. They would trample and gore their foes.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>A mastodon could be summoned by the conjure animals spell .</p>
<p>Only very powerful druids were able to use these hulking beasts as animal companions .</p>
<p>They were outstandingly strong, and if trained were able to carry up to 12,580 pounds (5,706 kilograms) and haul up to about 62,400 pounds (28,300 kilograms) worth of cargo.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These huge animals could adapt to live in many types of environments, from cold and temperate forests to jungles and tropical islands. Mastodons often organized themselves into small groups and herds of up to six.</p>
<p>Mastodons were fairly rare throughout Faerûn , but could sometimes be found in the company of frost giants . They were more common to the far east of the continent, close to the boundary of Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Thayans were known to purchase ivory tusks of mastodons for about 500 gp each. Only non-fossilized ivory was generally sold across Faerûn.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mastodons were once far more prevalent across Faerûn, found as far as Vaasa and Damara . Expansive civilizations drove them further to the east, even to the Hordelands , where they still existed by the mid–14 th century DR . However, their population was known to be slowly decreasing.</p>
