<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vangerdahast Aeiulvana was a famous royal magician to King Azoun Obarskyr IV . Before that, however, he was an accomplished spell-slinging adventurer. One of the deeds that brought him fame was creating the master adventurer's robes . With wizards being extremely vulnerable in close combat, these sets of enchanted cloth granted them protection and time to weave a spell against the melee opponents.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , master adventurer's robes could be found in possession of wizards from Cormyr , the Sword Coast , and Daggerford vicinity.</p>
