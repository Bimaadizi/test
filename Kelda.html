<p>Kelda was a horse that accompanied the chosen of Cyric Malik el Sami for a time during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The horse had a sad look to her eyes and expression but appeared to otherwise be well cared for, if a bit overweight.</p>
<p>She walked with exceptional grace, more akin to a unicorn that a regular horse.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Malik was especially fond of Kelda, far more than his previous mount: the goat -devouring hell-horse named Halah that was "gifted" to him by Cyric . Malik demonstrated his affection for Kelda by cooing to her, extolling her virtues or even kissing her on the snout.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Malik and Kelda traveled all the way from Thousand Faces in the Greypeak Mountains to Reitheillaethor and the Dire Wood within the High Forest . After Malik relocated to Villa Dusari in the Netherese city of Thultanthar the following year , Kelda was given a comfortable home within the city's stables.</p>
