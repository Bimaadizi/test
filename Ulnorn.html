<p>Ulnorn, blood of Jalabar was one of the dwarves who would found the kingdom of Roldilar in the Vast in north Faer√ªn in the 7th century DR . He was a warrior and a descendent of Jalabar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After its forging and enchantment in the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR , the magical sword Sarghathuld , or "Orcbane" was given to Ulnorn. Wielding Orcbane, Ulnorn fought with courage in the dwarves' battles against the orcs of Vastar , culminating in that realm's fall in the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR , and the rise of the dwarven kingdom of Roldilar.</p>
<p>Ulnorn later journeyed to Myth Drannor in its heyday, and there dwarven craftsmen and elven mages further enchanted Sarghathuld . But with the fall of Myth Drannor in the Year of Doom, 714 DR , Sarghathuld disappeared from history for almost twenty years.</p>
