<p>Hasklar's Arms & Armor was a shop in Yartar in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR that offered perhaps the highestâ€“quality and most expensive armor in all of the North . It was run by Hasklar .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Hasklar's Arms & Armor boasted a wide variety of armaments, that came in many shapes and sizes. The prices were as expensive as any others found throughout the Sword Coast North .</p>
<p>Unlike some other armorers, Hasklar was not a smith and sold his wares "as is". He could not offer any wearer-specific modifications or alterations.</p>
<p>Among the items for sale were:</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The shop was well-protected by what appeared to be two animated weapons, that were diligent in their pursuit of shoplifters. In fact, these weapons were wielded by the watchghost that was dedicated to Hasklar, along with several other undead spirits .</p>
