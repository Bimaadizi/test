<p>Miraenna Odestone was a dwarvish weapon designer and the wife of Hagnen Odestone , who finished the creation of the unique enchanted heavy crossbow called Hagnen's Folly .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hagnen and Miraenna Odestone shared passion and profession, and that was the likely the cause of no love being lost between the couple. Both were passionate and often argued over every single piece of their designs and every part of running a household. Their clan remembered such spats of arguments as legendary. Shortly before the late 13 th century DR , Miraenna Odestone, annoyed with her husband's extensive backlog of unfinished weapons, laid them out in the workshop to prove a point and cursed each one with Hagnen's name. Soon after that, Hagnen Odestone was crushed to death in the Year of the Blade, 1275 DR , during a great historic earthquake. Naming the items after her late husband, Miraenna completed all of his weapons. One such weapon was the enchanted heavy crossbow she named Hagnen's Folly . To complete its design, she strung it with dragon gut giving the crossbow its unique speed and aim.</p>
<p>When all of Hagnen Odestone's inventions were finished, Miraenna left their clan and traveled south to rid herself of her husband's creations.</p>
