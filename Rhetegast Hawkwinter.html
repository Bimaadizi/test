<p>Rhetegast Hawkwinter , who went by Rhett , was a half-elf paladin of Torm and young noble of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Luskan</h3>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Rhett was a low-ranking Waterdavian guardsman assigned to man the blockade Waterdeep maintained around Luskan to keep the Fury plague from spreading. He met Kalen Dren as Kalen was attempting to enter the Cliffside Cranny gate. After a brief battle, Kalen subdued the guardsmen and left his powerful broadsword Vindicator with Rhett.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Rhett was able to wield the sword and later tracked down Kalen in Luskan with the intent of becoming Kalen's apprentice. The two were attacked and captured by the Dead Rats gang and taken back to the gang's headquarters. There, Rhett met Myrin Darkdance and Kalen assigned Rhett to guard her, though it was unlikely the powerful mage needed a bodyguard.</p>
<p>Rhett tagged along with Kalen and Myrin on several forays into Luskan to investigate the Fury plague infecting the city. Rhett helped defeat Scour , the demon who was the cause of the plague.</p>
<h3>Westgate</h3>
<p>Myrin shadow-walked with Rhett to Westgate so Rhett could train with Levia Shadewalker at the Eye of Justice , although Myrin returned to Luskan. While in Westgate, he met Lilten , who convinced him that Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him.</p>
<p>Rhett assumed the mantle of Shadowbane and began crusading throughout the city. However, Rhett disagreed with Kalen's methods and favored Tyr over the other aspects of the Threefold God and referred to himself as "Mercy".</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Early in their relationship, Rhett idolized Kalen and wanted to be his apprentice although Kalen refused. During his time in Westgate, Rhett disapproved of Kalen's lack of mercy but in the end reconciled with him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Rhett was one of three crusaders who, as of 1480 DR, was able to wield Vindicator .</p>
<p>While crusading, he dressed as Kalen with leather armor and a helm .</p>
