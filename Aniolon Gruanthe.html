<p>Aniolon Gruanthe was a wizard from Estagund who led a number of other arcanists and malcontents away from the kingdom to found the town of Lliiress . He made a deal for the protection of the blue dragon Gerinvioch ; after the dragon trapped the town with the Evise Jhontil , Aniolon was slain by the artifact.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had stubby fingers, thinning black hair, but he was rather young, and a face that was round, reminiscent of a coin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aniolon Gruanthe was enthralled by power over other people, but was swift to resort to bizarre schemes, such as entreating with a dragon, for the sake of obtaining it. He cared for the people under his reign only nominally.</p>
<p>He pitied those who served something they didn't believe in.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Gruanthe could cast at least one scrying spell. He also could bind imps to his service.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Aniolon wore the accoutrements of a wizard.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Aniolon briefly bound the imp Quiono in 976 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 976 DR , Gruanthe had become the leader of a splinter faction of mages and clerics from Estagund, most importantly from the faiths of Sharess and Lliira , whom he promised to lead into a new place, where they could worship freely, without concern for the laws of Estagund. Before that he had once been a rival of Umbeso in seeking positions of power, and a student of magic under Sohj .</p>
<p>On 976 DR , while in Lliiress, Gruanthe came up with the scheme to request the aid of the blue dragon Gerinvioch. He summoned an imp to scout out the lair, and then arrived with a retinue totaling eight people. Gerinvioch slew most of them with a single breath; Aniolon still managed to talk to the dragon, and then finalized a deal with it, by which the beast would get the bodies of all of the people in the retinue, but would help protect Aniolon's town, were they to secure the Evise Jhontil for him.</p>
<p>Gruanthe sent a team of twenty to acquire the artifact; twelve of them died in the process, with four more dying on the way back. He then sent word to the dragon, who arrived and began a ritual; the human tried to smooth over the doubts of those who were still unsure about the dragon's spell.</p>
<p>After the dragon completed his spell, and the town discovered alongside Gruanthe that they were trapped and that spells would kill them, Gruanthe's mood and stability began to slip from frustration. He died shortly after, when the temptation to scry on Gerinvioch became too great.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
