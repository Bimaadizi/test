<p>Logenn , known as Red Logenn and Logenn the Red Wolf , was a skilled assassin active in Luskan in the late 15 th century DR . At the time of his death, he was said to be the most skilled killer in Luskan, if not the whole of the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Logenn was quick, dexterous, and adept at silent killing. He charged handsomely for his services, and only accepted jobs that piqued his interest.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He enjoyed and took pride his work, and preferred to hunt targets with enough skill to make the chase interesting. When things went poorly for him, he remained calm and careful even as he was quick to curse.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He fought with a short sword in one hand and a long dagger in the other.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Logenn had a history with Eden of the Clearlight , leader of the Coin Spinners gang in Luskan, although he generally preferred not to work for her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Logenn was hired by Eden of the Clearlight to kill the paladin Kalen Dren . The assassin accepted the job out of curiosity given that the bounty was unusually large for a visitor to Luskan. Eden gave him a gold coin that allowed her to scry on his progress.</p>
<p>Logenn tracked his target to Kalen's lodgings in Luskan—enjoying that his quarry was pretty good at covering his tracks—before giving the paladin time to drift off to sleep (the assassin sang Ghost and the Maiden to himself to pass the time). He then disarmed an alchemist's fire trap that Kalen had set in his window, but before he could proceed to the kill, he was intercepted by a disguised Lilten , who pinned and silenced him. Logenn quickly got free, but was burned to death when Lilten threw the alchemist's fire upon him.</p>
