<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Electrum dragons enjoyed debating and trading, and were generally welcoming to visitors. They were very fond of beautiful objects.

<h2>Biology</h2>
<h3>Breath</h3>
<p>The unique dragon breath of electrums consisted of a gas that had the effect of rendering creatures weakened and confused, in an effect similar to the ray of enfeeblement and confusion spells. These effects lingered in the area for several seconds after being released by the dragon.</p>
<h3>Reproduction</h3>

Once laid, the eggs hatched in a few days.</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
