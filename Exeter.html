<h2>History</h2>
<p>Exeter was a member of the Company of the Swan, alongside Matilda the White Lady , Henry the Shadow Master , Ratha Rann , Sagrais Bigelow , and his fellow wizard Wemick. With one illusionist and two wizards in the same adventuring company it was only natural that one would upstage the other, even if not intentionally. Harboring a small inferiority complex he had a friend-foe relationship with Wemick, but nothing too severe at that time. In time they all grew old and finally retired to the Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers where Exeter and Wemic became roommates for several years. In the home however many of the stories told by the other members of the old adventuring company was about how Wemick did this or Wemick did that and never really about what Exeter did. As advanced age crept in he began suffering from a severe persecution complex and having delusions of grandeur. In the end it all became too much for Exeter and he left the retirement home in the dead of night and resumed adventuring. For the next 15 years he once more plied his trade as a wizard, with his insanity slowly becoming worse. In the end he used all his resources, all his accumulated wealth, to force a last duel between the members of his old company and himself and a group of hired and summoned individuals to lord his power, his greatness over the other old retirees. He had hired Icehand a frost giant , Maralix a human fighter , Hedgeheart a dwarven thief , and Simon an illusionist , and summoned Chillclaw a gurgon baatezu with a spell scroll . He himself would duel Wemick in a fight to the death, believing that only then could he upstage Wemick and show that he had always been the greater mage.</p>
