<p>Nicknack was an ettin druid with two identical heads.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although below average height for an ettin at 12 feet (3.7 meters), Nicknack looked strong and intimidating. Unusually for his kind, his two heads looked identical.</p>
<p>Nicknack was well-groomed: his skin was rosy pink, he had cleanly manicured fingernails, and his hair was tidily curled and combed. He generally wore a brown robe with sandals .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While his heads looked identical, the two had distinct personalities, especially after the effects of a helm of opposite alignment , which rendered Nick lawful good while Nack remained chaotic evil . Even after fighting off the effects of the helm and gaining a shared neutral alignment, Nick retained a lawful bent, while Nack leaned somewhat chaotic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In his capability as a druid, Nicknack usually used the spells animal friendship , augury , detect magic , entangle , goodberry , locate animals or plants , and speak with animals .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>On his right head, Nicknack wore an expended silver helm of opposite alignment , which was styled like a dragon 's skull. On his left, he wore a used-up gem of insight , which appeared as a large human-fist-sized emerald , embedded in a golden circlet . He wielded a pair of gigantic scimitars .</p>
<p>Nicknack also had a figurine of wondrous power , which turned into a white marble elephant named Raj .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At a young age, Nicknack conquered an orc tribe by slaying its chieftain. Over the next five years of his life, he led his subjects on a reign of terror over the region surrounding the orcs' tribal home. His campaign came to an end when a more powerful human army destroyed the tribe, leading Nicknack to wander Faerûn as a lone adventurer .</p>
<p>On one of his adventures, Nicknack slew a red dragon . Looking through the dragon's hoard of treasure, he unwittingly donned a helm of opposite alignment , which, coupled with the ettin's unusual symmetry and the gem of insight he happened to be holding at the time, caused the ettin's heads to have opposing alignments. This division between good and evil nearly drove Nicknack to madness, and as the ettin was flailing around in a forest, he was discovered by a druid named Gallan .</p>
<p>With Gallan's help, Nicknack was able to restore balance between his heads, shifting to a neutral alignment. The druid, sensing the ettin's intelligence and wisdom, proceeded to teach Nicknack the principles of the druidic faith, as well as reading and writing. With his newfound skills, Nicknack became an avid reader of books about philosophy, religion, and morality.</p>
<p>As his skills as a druid and philosopher grew, Nicknack converted to the Silvanite faith. When his mentor died, the ettin took to wandering Faerûn once more. In this chapter of his travels, he came into the possession of a marble elephant figurine of wondrous power , which became his mount of choice.</p>
<p>At some point, Nicknack became an advisor to the mayor of Ravens Bluff , Charles Oliver O'Kane .</p>
