<p>Dorenn was a human rogue and adventurer of the Puppetmasters company circa 1369 DR . He was notable among them for being the only one who had actually been a puppeteer in his earlier life.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dorenn was a slightly unbalanced man who enjoyed indulging his desires for mischief and lechery.</p>
<p>One of his favorite tricks was to put his tanar'ri puppet on his hand, have it hold his dagger, and use it to backstab a target while invisible. His other favorite trick was to put his paladin puppet on his hand and use it to pinch women's bottoms while invisible.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Dorenn used a magical short sword and a magical dagger in combat. He wore magical leather armor and carried dust of disappearance for getting himself or his allies around unseen. He also had prized handpuppets that resembled a tanar'ri and a paladin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , the Puppetmasters came up with a scheme to win an easy prize for the company. Dorenn pretended to be a dead man, who happened to have a letter and treasure map for the dungeon of Barrenstone , allowing another adventuring group to excavate and clear out the complex. When they emerged from the dungeon with the treasure, the Puppetmasters attempted to rob their victims, only to be driven off and receive nothing for their troubles.</p>
