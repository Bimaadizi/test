<h2>History</h2>
<p>The area was settled around 146Â DR by the migrating Illuskans . Yarlith was founded north of Uthtower in the Year of the Broken Lands, 191 DR to prevent strife between the twin heirs of the Royal House of Myrmoran , allowing Prince Uth II to become King of Uthtower, while his younger twin Ornoth I would have claim to the lightly settled lands in the north. Their mage royal, Iniarv , fashioned twin enchanted crowns so as to foreswear squabbling over their father's crown; this enchanted crown linked their minds, allowing them to operate effectively with one will. Around the turn of the 3 rd century DR , settlers from Yarlith established a number of holds along the Dessarin , forming what would be Mlembryn. In the Year of the Greengrass, 205 DR , they were also part of the recolonization of Illusk .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Pernicious Hauberk, 568 DR , the armies of Phalorm were the defenders of that city while the orcs under the frost giant Hrothgar attacked it. The city fell later, in the Year of the Normiir, 611 DR , to the orcs of the Everhorde from the Spine of the World .</p>
