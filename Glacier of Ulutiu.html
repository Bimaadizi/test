<p>The Glacier of Ulutiu lay in the Nakvaligach region of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Glacier of Ulutiu was located in the southwestern corner of Nakvaligach, to the south of the Igotak Sea , on the northern shore of the Uppuk River . It was once up to 300 yards (270 meters) long, but centuries of exposure had eroded the glacier down to a wall of ice 100 yards (91 meters) in length by the mid–14 th century.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The glacier had a unique feature. It was covered in detailed and intricate symbols, etched directly into the ice. The symbols radiated magical energy and had a faint red glow. The symbols protected the glacier from all forms of heat, including magical. The symbols were legible by means of a spell such as comprehend languages .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long ago, Ulutiu began carving the symbols into the glacier. The symbols were a journal of sorts, recording the deity's thoughts, the history of the Great Glacier, and notes on his magical research. Much of this record was later lost, as pieces of the glacier fell into the Uppuk River. Local legends held that what was lost included instructions on how to resurrect Ulutiu, a map to his hoard of treasure, and instructions for powerful spells .</p>
<p>In −1362 DR , some Ulutiuns discovered the glacier and translated some of its writings. Those who chose to remain in Nakvaligach to worship Ulutiu eventually became the Nakulutiuns . Those who rejected Ulutiu and returned to Alpuk became the Iulutiuns .</p>
