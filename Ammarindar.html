<p>Ammarindar was a ruined city in the Northdark , inhabited by tanarukks in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city of Ammarindar was located primarily in the Northdark between the drow cities of Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad . It was located in the region of the ancient dwarven kingdom of the same name that also included territory covering the upper Delimbiyr Vale , between the High Forest and the Fallen Lands .</p>
<p>Ammarindar was located some 250 miles southeast of Menzoberranzan and was linked to the city by dwarven tunnels carved over the Darklake.</p>
<p>The path through Ammarindar was considered the quickest journey between Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad, but around the year 1372 DR , was less traveled because of the danger that lurked there.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Originally carved by dwarves , the city's tunnels bore many features of dwarven architecture. The city had large boulevards and large chambers, whose walls were inscribed with dethek runes .</p>
<p>Ammarindar had a foundry of black iron and runes. It was located in a huge cavern with pillars carved into the shapes of dragons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dwarven nation of Ammarindar was founded before both Cormanthyr and Netheril in −4100 DR . The kingdom, along with elven Eaerlann , fell to hordes of orcs and demons from Hellgate Keep in 882 DR .</p>
<p>After the city's fall, its tunnels in the Underdark were inhabited by drow from Ched Nasad and beholders from the Graypeak Mountains . Around 1220 DR , the demons of Hellgate Keep drove off the other inhabitants and claimed it for their own. Later, the territory was slowly encroached upon by the great fungal growth known as Araumycos .</p>
<p>After the fall of Hellgate Keep in 1369 DR , a section of Ammarindar was inhabited by the cambion Kaanyr Vhok and his Scourged Legion , an army of tanarukks .</p>
<p>In the decade after Vhok's disappearance, the connection between Hellgate Keep and Ammarindar was severed. The Scourged Legion was taken over by a tanarukk known as Warchief Ghaarzhvex .</p>
