<p>Talgath , also known as the Watcher of Castle Never , Talgath the Watcher , and later Talgath the Undying , was a beholder who occupied Castle Never in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Talgath expected that any living thing that it met would submit to its domination, and it believed that eventually all such beings would inevitably do so. It generally considered most humanoids beneath its notice, even intruders within its domain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after the Ruining , Talgath arrived in Castle Never to claim the abandoned ruin for its own. It managed to beat back the undead forces of Valindra Shadowmantle , and aimed to conquer the castle from the top-down, thus starting by subjugating the ettercaps who dwelt in the towers. The ettercap leader, Ryxfith , prophesied that someone from outside the castle would arrive to defeat the beholder for them.</p>
<p>Valindra's minions proved unable to defeat Talgath despite her declaring that it was a major priority, however it would ultimately be slain by adventurers from Neverwinter in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . This was not the end for Talgath, however, as years later it would be reanimated to serve Orcus in undeath , and thus become known as Talgath "the Undying" as it once more inhabited the ruined castle.</p>
