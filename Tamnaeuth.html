<p>Tamnaeuth was a very old elf armorer who lived in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>He created high-quality swords , mail , and plate armor . Most of his pieces were enchanted and often became legendary both on Evermeet and in the world at large. He didn't charge a fee for his creations, instead offering them to people he chose, trusting that if elves with influence accepted his works it would bolster his reputation. In exchange for this, the recipients of his items provided him with food, clothing, and other things he needed.</p>
