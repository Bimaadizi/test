<p>The Great Road , also referred to by locals as simply the Road , was the single roadway that passed through the length of the Great Dale and that for many years separated the Dunwood and the Forest of Lethyr , in the Unapproachable East region of northeast Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It originated in the coastal city of Uthmere , along the Easting Reach , and continued east through the entirety of the dale until intersecting with the Cold Road at the hamlet of Kront .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Traveling the length of the Great Road on foot took approximately 15 to 20 days. The Dalestream ran parallel with the road for nearly half of this distance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Construction of the Great Road itself was initiated by Lord Uthmere , the first ruler of his namesake city.</p>
<p>The Great Road fell into disuse throughout the 15 th century and was mostly overgrown as of the late 1470s DR .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Long before humans "settled" the region of the Great Dale, a stretch of what would become the Great Road was the primary means of transportation between the elves of eastern Faerûn and Kara-Tur . This was achieved by means of a series of magical stones that could open a passageway to the eastern continent twice a year, on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.</p>
<p>During the Age of Humanity and the Era of Upheaval , this secret was well-protected by the druids of the Circle of Leth .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Situated along the Great Road were about a dozen minor clanholds, including Carwyth Hold, Noonym's Hold, and Thy's Hold.</p>
