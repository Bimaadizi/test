<p>The Hallowed Redeemer was a special two-handed sword owned by the paladin Keldorn Firecam .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He received it as a gift from Torm himself early on in his career, and no-one else could use it. He was wielding it in 1369 DR .</p>
<p>A bastard sword called Hallowed Redeemer surfaced in the 1370s DR with a different appearance and a very different enchantment and usable by others.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<p>The other Hallowed Redeemer was a +3 undead bane bastard sword .</p>
