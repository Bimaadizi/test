<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , following the Siege of Neverwinter , Gaelen was assigned to spy on the activities of the Many-Arrows orcs who had occupied Neverwinter's Tower District . She was the sole sentry assigned to a post behind enemy lines, in a ruined house just north of the orcish camps around the Cloak Tower . From there, she observed the orcs and planned reconnaissance missions that uncovered the orcs' plans and weakened their defenses. Captain Janros sent the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge , via Private Quickfoot , to carry out missions for Gaelen. These included raiding the camp to seize battle plans and to target and slay shaman eyes of Gruumsh who were maintaining a ward around the Cloak Tower. She then coordinated assassination missions targeting first the Many-Arrows' warband leaders outside the Cloak Tower— Lurg Bloodspear , Drogthu Elfeater , and Kragmar Deepscar —and then their commander within the Tower itself— Vansi Bloodscar .</p>
