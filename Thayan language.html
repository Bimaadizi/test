<p>Thayan was a language spoken by the inhabitants of Thay . It was also known as Thayian .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As one of the Mulhorandi languages , Thayan was highly inflected, and word order was of only minor importance. It sounded thick and slow to speakers of many other languages.</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>In their earliest forms, the Mulhorandi languages used a logographic system of writing, which included pictographs to represent concepts. Over the millennia, the written forms of the languages were simplified yet still contained tens of thousands of pictographs. By the late 14 th century DR , however, speakers of Thayan utilized the Infernal alphabet in their writing, as a direct insult to the god-kings of neighboring Mulhorand , who used the Celestial script. A century later, they had switched to using the Thorass alphabet .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thayan was so closely related to Mulhorandi that many scholars considered them a single language. Both languages were in the Mulani languages group within the Rauric languages family.</p>
