<p>Firecake was a simple type of fried food from the city of Velen in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Firecakes were served at The Figureheadless tavern in Velen alongside nauseating fishhead soup and frybreads . The main ingredients of these handfoods were "found meats," such as fish , rodents , and other less savory creatures. The meat was chopped and generously mixed with hot peppers to mask the taste. Then the meat was breaded and fried. Volothamp Geddarm warned his readers that firecakes were for people with strong stomachs.</p>
