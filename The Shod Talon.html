<p>The Shod Talon was a tavern and inn in the city of Ravens Bluff that catered to elves and half-elves .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tavern stood along Mac Intyre Path , in the Sixstar neighborhood of the city's Uptown District .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Shod Talon was housed within an old stucco building with a slate roof, which had a 15 feet (4.6 meters) by 40 feet (12 meters) patio perched atop it. Outside the building was hung a sign depicting a roc with talons outstretched. Said talons on the sign were covered with steel .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Within the storage room of the building stood a spiral staircase that led up to the Shod Talon's rooftop patio.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>This establishment was a lively place of chatter, drink, and dancing for all manner of elves and half-elves. Humans and halflings that visited the tavern would find themselves tolerated, though not as comfortable as they would in other nearby establishments. However, the place was not nearly as prejudiced as the Ill Eagle Inn .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The prices of goods on offer at the Shod Talon were higher than some other establishments within the area, but by far not the highest. And with the quality of the food and drink on offer, very few saw fit to complain about these prices.</p>
<p>In addition to food and drink, the Shod Talon offered lodgings in one of its ten rooms at a nightly cost of 1 to 5 gold pieces, usually offering this service to elves or anyone who couldn't or didn't wish to stay at one of the local inns for one reason or another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime prior to the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , Voron Orama came to the city of Ravens Bluff in search of a relative. While there he purchased their decrepit establishment, the Shod Talon, and rebuilt it. The new owner cared little for the name "Shod Talon", but refused to change it out of a fear that doing so would bring bad luck.</p>
<p>The Shod Talon was closed down for a time during the Three Women War , but reopened after its conclusion.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The tavern was lived in and operated by the moon elf Voron Orama . The building was also lived in by its cook, the half-elf Gaolla Luathe , and the wild elf waitress Dumiriel .</p>
