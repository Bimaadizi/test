<p>The Hoard was a demiplane created in 116 DR when five wizards of Cormyr trapped Nalavarauthatoryl in the Grodd demiplane. Unlike the Grodd demiplane in which Nalavarauthatoryl was imprisoned, the Hoard demiplane was far more "vivid". The Hoard demiplane and the Grodd demiplane were linked via a gate .</p>
