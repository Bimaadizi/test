<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mad Hermit was an old human man dressed in simple tattered robes permanently stained with browned blood stains. Underneath his robes, the man wore enchanted +2 scale mail and wielded a magic +3 greataxe .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Mad Hermit made a home in a Neverwinter Wood cave. The cave's opening had an unnerving air of menace about it, and an overhanging rock above was reminiscent of a dire beast's open maw. Inside, the Mad Hermit built a shrine and a sacrificial altar dedicated to his deity, Malar , the Black-Blooded One. Alongside the Hermit, the cave was home to two massive dire bears who served the Malarite. The shrine included a unique carved totem made of some unknown type of wood. It was light as if made of paper and smooth as if shaped by strange magics. The Mad Hermit fed many travelers to his beasts and captured other victims, only for them to be bled on the cave's altar. His victims were found with two small punctures on their necks next to each other.</p>
