<p>A talisman of the sphere was an enchanted piece of jewelry that made it easier for a spellcaster to control a sphere of annihilation .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These small adamantine loops had a small handle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items were not only useless to non-wizards, the would actually cause physical harm to any non-wizard who held them. When held by a wizard concentrating on controlling a sphere of annhilation , a talisman of the sphere increased the wizard's chance of success. However, if the wizard was unable to gain control over the sphere of annhilation , it would proceed to move toward the wizard at its maximum speed. A wand of negation targeted at a talisman of the sphere would negate the control.</p>
