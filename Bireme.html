<h2>History</h2>
<p>Over the years, biremes were primarily used on Toril by the nations of east Faer√ªn . These included the navies of Chessenta and Unther in the Old Empires region, the navy of Aglarond in the Unapproachable East , and the nation of Chondath in the Vilhon Reach . Outside of naval use, biremes originating from both Chessenta and Chondath were among the pirate vessels one could encounter in the Pirate Isles as of 1356 DR .</p>
<p>Unther's navy was once the terror of the southern Inner Sea with its fleet of a hundred warships, most of them biremes and triremes, but over the course of several years their navy was whittled down until by 1359 DR it consisted of just five ships that were kept docked in the port city of Unthalass .</p>
