<p>Wary was an item enchantment that could be applied to an armor or shield .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wary armors and shields generally had no visual features worth noting.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Powerful rogues had an ability to prevent people from flanking them, thanks to their great awareness and ability to react. Only people with considerably more skill as a rogue could flank them, and the wary armor quality made it even harder.</p>
<p>Creating a wary suit of armor or a wary shield required the casting of a cat's grace spell .</p>
