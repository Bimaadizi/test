<p>Galvan was the Blue Dragon Wyrmspeaker in the reformed Cult of the Dragon of Severin Silrajin .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Galvan thought very much like a scheming blue dragon . He was also Talis Kasterel 's mentor and saw Severin as a man of great vision and destiny, and thus would never act against him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galvan was born in Thay and had aspirations to be a Red Wizard but his magic skill was not great enough. He joined the Cult of the Dragon and served for a long time. When Severin entered the Cult, Galvan saw him as a charismatic leader and soon allied with him. He always maintained contacts among the Red Wizards and under Severin's leadership Galvan acted as a link between the two groups. There was a secret family connection between him and Rath Modar , the lead Red Wizard allied with the Cult. Galvan also plotted against Valindra Shadowmantle hoping to acquire or destroy her dragon's orb .</p>
