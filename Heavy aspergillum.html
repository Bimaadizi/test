<p>A heavy aspergillum was a weapon that combined the features of an aspergillum and a heavy mace . It was only used by the Ilmaterans of the kingdom of Impiltur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like the ordinary aspergillum, the heavy aspergillum took the form of a metal club or mace, with a reservoir inside that could contain up to three flask's worth of holy water . Pressing a button on the shaft opened up the perforations in the head, allowing holy water to leak out. In this way, the aspergillum could spray holy water over a short distance or on anything struck by it, using one flask's worth per shot.</p>
<p>Unlike the ordinary aspergillum, the heavy aspergillum was designed as a melee weapon, with the effectiveness of a heavy mace.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>In addition to its ritual uses, the heavy aspergillum could be used as a weapon as well as a means of spraying monsters with holy water. Circa 1372 DR , it was used almost exclusively by the worshipers of Ilmater the Crying God in the kingdom of Impiltur against the demons that terrorized that realm.</p>
