<p>Zoraxzil was a mind flayer agent for hire who investigated Graz'zt 's schemes in Tethyamar during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zoraxzil had a meticulous and calculating view of the world, not given to panic or anger. They had a very professional and serious view on their work.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zoraxzil worked alongside the drow warrior Silent , who typically kept Zoraxzil safe from physical threats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zoraxzil and Silent were hired by secretive employers to investigate the events surrounding Graz'zt 's manipulation of the jewels of ardor. The pair searched the area around Tethyamar, eventually tracking down the source to the Eastern Reaches where Graz'zt had laired. They were unexpectedly trapped inside the village of Faraway , a construct of illusions and conjured materials, filled with demons play-acting at human residents. While Zoraxzil's telepathy let them easily see through the trickery (much to Graz'zt's annoyance), the pair were separated and the mind flayer was incapacitated with nausea after eating the brain of a disguised dretch .</p>
<p>Right on schedule, Graz'zt lured a party of adventurers sent by Inger Ingersdottir from the nearby Tethyamar mining outpost into the illusion, pointing them right at the menacing drow and the vomiting mind flayer invaders. Though not presented in the best light, the would-be heroes likely talked their way into a mutual understanding with Zoraxzil and Silent, working together to unravel Graz'zt's plot and ruin his game.</p>
