<p>Haft Over Head was a unique and oddly shaped enchanted throwing axe crafted by doubtlessly the worst carpenter in the history of Faerûn – Dullcobble Tweed .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This misshapen weapon defied all common sense as it dealt blunt damage when thrown at the target. Due to its peculiar form and inscribed magics, the landing hit was done by the thick crooked haft of the axe, instead of its axehead. The weapon also possessed a simple +1 enchantment and magically returned to the wielder's hand after being thrown.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Infamously bad at his craft, Dullcobble Tweed lived sometime before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR . Many believed him to be the worst carpenter to have ever walked the surface of Toril . Despite it, he was a braggart and boasted of his great skill insistingly. Locals from his town grew tired of the man and challenged him to craft a quality chopping axe. Dullcobble happily accepted the challenge but as soon as he came back to the shop, he panicked.</p>
<p>Several inept and misshapen axes were created, but none were functional. A single day before he was scheduled to unveil his masterwork publicly, Dullcobble Tweed found a wild mage to enhance an especially overbalanced, crooked, and lopsided axe of his creation. The enchanted struggled with making the useless piece of junk into a weapon but eventually succeeded and took his payment, creating the Haft Over Head axe.</p>
<p>Dullcobble presented his creation at the town hall and was immediately mocked relentlessly and laughed at. Angered at the observers, the weaponsmith crew the axe at his tormentors. He missed, but the crowd witnessed his ugly axe smash into a stone column with its plump haft. The column shattered, causing the town hall to collapse. The crowd and challengers fled the collapsing building and escaped unharmed while a large piece of falling timber knocked Dullcobble Tweed out.</p>
<p>The injury left Dullcobble as the village idiot, and Haft Over Head was tossed on a merchant's cart heading north and forgotten about.</p>
<p>In 1312 DR, a small logging village of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale became besieged by a horde of savage humanoids and Malarites of the north. One of the monsters was troll Vrek Vileclaw who took a cave not far from the Ford as his lair. The troll kept a stash of loot in a rickety crate in his lair, with Haft Over Head being among his stolen treasures.</p>
