<p>Tukan was a city in Maztica 's House of Tezca desert that was built by Nexalans.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Tukan sat in a valley in the center of the House of Tezca desert. This valley was actually very fertile, and had a lake in the middle of it. A series of oases led north from it to the Valley of Nexal . However, the surrounding lands were a barren, desert wasteland. The city of Tukan itself sat upon the shore of the lake.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Tukan was built by humans from the Nexal Valley, and thus shared much of the same culture and traditions. However, they did not practice human sacrifice and they worshiped the god Qotal prominently.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tukan was founded in 1362 DR when Qotal caused a the valley, lake, and series of oases to miraculously appear in the desert. People fleeing the Valley of Nexal during the Night of Wailing and Mount Zatal 's concurrent eruption followed the oases before settling in the valley and then began building a new city for themselves.</p>
<p>At some point during this same century, Aurora sent field agents to Tukan to set up lines of trade for culinary goods for her emporium and catalogue .</p>
