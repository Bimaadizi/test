<p>Dagsumn ( pronounced : /ˈ d ɑː g ɑː s ʌ m m / DAG-ah-summ ) was a wizard in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Dagsumn was friendly and could be relied onto honor an agreement, but he had a hunger for new magic and was fastidious with regard to details. He preferred to work in the City of the Dead , far from the risk that someone might discover his secrets. When Dagsumm found about new magic items, he could become very irritating, asking very insistently for details.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Outside of his experiments in the City of the Dead, Dagsumm passed his time at the Elfsong Tavern , near to the house he shared with his wife.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dagsumn hailed from Port Llast and was tutored in the magical arts by Malchor Harpell at the Tower of Twilight . His apprenticeship with Malchor ended peacefully around the 1320s DR , but they had not spoken to each other since. Afterward, he came to live in Waterdeep, where he met his wife Kyrss Wands of the Wands family.</p>
