<p>Kaet Ling was a ruthless businesswoman from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kaet Ling was a human woman with hazel eyes, reddish-brown hair gathered in a bun, and sun-kissed golden skin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the city of Baldur's Gate shuddered under the Absolute crisis , certain goods started to become rare and expensive. One such material that skyrocketed in price was saltpeter . Kaet sought to purchase a shipment of barreled saltpeter from the dwarvish trader Djingo and participated in a bidding war against Smiley Gheef and Pheebs Splayfoot . Djingo charged at least 500 gold pieces per barrel, a high price as he knew that once Baldur's Gate was besieged, he'd easily sell it for double that amount to the foundry. Smiley Gheef offered 700 gp per barrel, but the bidding ward ended abruptly when Kaet Ling offered to pay 1,000 gp per barrel, in cash, no notes.</p>
