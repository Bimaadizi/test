<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sunderstone along with its ancient owner were entombed long before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War. Even though the catacombs where the tomb was located were regularly raided by drow , orcs , orogs , and the Cult of the Dragon , in 1369 DR , Sunderstone was still inside its master's tomb. Along with a few other crypts of heroes in the depths of the Elven Catacombs, the Receiver of Respect was the part of the tomb. It was designed to release the legendary weapon in exchange for another mundane warhammer in times of dire need.</p>
