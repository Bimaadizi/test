<p>The Nesher ( pronounced : / n ɛ ˈ ʃ ʌr / neh-SHURR ) family was a member of the pantheon of Waterdhavian nobility , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . They were in the lumber and wood-making business and were keen hawk -masters.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The patriarch of the Nesher clan was Lord Laskar Nesher from at least the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , to at least the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . His young consort was Lady Stelar ( née Stelar Thorp ). Laskar's eldest son and heir was Kastonoph . As of 1372 DR, there were thirty-one members of the noble family. As their business interests involved forestry, they generally revered the goddess Mielikki .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The family enjoyed hawking as a sport and as a business venture.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Nesher Villa was a walled compound of one- and two-story buildings surrounding a green space located in the Sea Ward on the southwest corner of the intersection of Mendever Street with Chasso's Trot . Just across Mendever Street and down a couple doors was the Gundwynd family villa. Directly across the alley on the south side of the compound was the towering five-story domicile of Hlethvagi Anteos .</p>
<p>Lord Khallos Nesher , brother of Lord Laskar, built a small villa outside of Silverymoon around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . He had business interests in Quaervarr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lady Stelar was opposed to Lord Ultas Maernos and his campaign to create a haven for the non-human residents of Waterdeep. She, along with other like-minded nobles, attempted to bring him down through skullduggery, but he was successfully protected by the Defenders Three .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Nesher family were of Chondathan descent and the family was ennobled in the Year of the Hooded Falcon, 1291 DR .</p>
<p>Sometime in the early 1370s DR, Lord Laskar, Lady Stelar, and Kastonoph attended the disastrous wedding between the Open Lord of Waterdeep , Piergeiron the Paladinson , and Eidola of Neverwinter . Kastonoph witnessed a doppleganger attack, foiled an assassination attempt, and learned that his own father was attempting to blackmail the bride-to-be.</p>
<p>A month after the abduction, the majority of Waterdeep's inhabitants thought Piergeiron the Paladinson dead as his spirit was trapped inside a soul gem . In the weeks that led to the Open Lord's funeral, Laskar Nesher was among ambitious nobles fighting for Piergeiron's position. Neshers stirred public opinion, gave numerous speeches, and even provided bleached oak panels, rails, and bosses for the Palace of Waterdeep , "out of love for the great Piergeiron." In the month Waterdeep was without an Open Lord, Laskar won support of ten respected merchants and three guilds, as well as made an agreement with Boareskyr brothers, the Boareskyr Bridge in exchange for High Forest lumber, claiming the trade route with Kara-Tur . Laskar and his consort Stelar were both present during the funeral ceremony. However, Laskar's grab for power was for naught with Piergeiron's recovery soon after.</p>
