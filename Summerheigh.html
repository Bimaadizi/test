<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Summerheigh had spent her entire life in the Resurrection Gorge. Some years before 1369 DR, Summerheigh's son, Vernus , a powerful druid in his own right, performed a ritual at the heart of the gorge in an attempt to reach the Beastlands , the planar home of his beloved deity. The ritual went awry, and instead, he opened a gate that allowed a powerful fiend to step into the Resurrection Gorge. To stop the creature, Yarrow , the great tree's dryad , bound the fiend to the gorge. The fiend's influence twisted and poisoned the nature around the prison. The aged druid believed that the trapped creature's poisonous influence could, with time, spread and affect the entirety of Amn, reaching Athkatla and Esmeltaran . Summerheigh did not know the creature's nature and planned to venture into the gorge to find out, when her life would be close to an end.</p>
