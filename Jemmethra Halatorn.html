<p>Jemmethra Halatorn was a human sorceress and wizard that apprenticed under Alustriel Silverhand , High Lady Mage of Silverymoon . Even among the Silvaeren and the High Lady's other apprentices, Jemmethra's plain looks belied how zealously she devoted herself to serving Alustriel.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jemmethra was a small and dainty woman; although this made her easy to overlook, such was her preference. Thus, she kept a rather monochromatic wardrobe of dull and austere grey, no matter if she was wearing a gown, breeches and a jerkin, or a full cloak , and only on formal occasions did her garb change to a black, velvet material. She even preferred to walk barefoot when indoors, so long as it wouldn't break any etiquette. This habit, however, did little to help the claims that her quiet gait was more of a scuttle, at least according to the High Palace 's other servants.</p>
<p>When she spoke, which was rare, Jemmethra's voice was always quiet, and neither did her face reveal much of her thoughts or emotions. This did not mean, though, that nothing about the apprentice mage caught the eye. Her own eyes, fittingly, were notable in and of themselves, being a vivid azure color and a size large enough to be distracting, if not abashing.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Jemmethra was always fervent in her many duties to Alustriel, whom the former worshiped. Atop her roles as a student and a servant, often bringing the High Lady anything she might request, Jemmethra also acted as a spy, a messenger, and a general runner of errands. In turn, this dynamic earned her certain privileges. With a singular exception, that being during a rendezvous between Alustriel and her fellow Chosen of Mystra , Jemmethra could meet with the High Lady at any place and any time, day or night.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Though Jemmethra was steadfast in her loyalty to Alustriel, few people had as much access to her. For this reason, Taern Hornblade , the High Lady's seneschal and the leader of her Spellguard , harbored a healthy suspicion towards Jemmethra. As such, her mind was magically probed by the Spellguard two to three times on a daily basis; luckily for all involved, however, no impersonator had yet been caught taking her place.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even before her apprenticeship under Alustriel's guidance, Jemmethra was accustomed to a life of servitude. Although it was slavery in all but name, she had worked as a house servant to one of the High Captains of Luskan , the rulers of that port city . Ultimately, however, the mistreatment she suffered forced her to leave it behind. Given the talents she had for the Art—talents that simultaneously alarmed and excited her—Jemmethra chose to flee inland and eastward, toward Silverymoon. She made the journey entirely over land, entirely on foot, and entirely by herself.</p>
<p>Overcoming the perils of the Savage Frontier , she was able to reach the Gem of the North—and it was there, on a night like any other, that she chanced upon Alustriel. The newcomer did not yet recognize the woman, whom she had met on the street, as the city's ruler, but Jemmethra nonetheless requested to apprentice under her. Despite her brazen behavior, and to the surprise of most, the High Lady accepted. At Alustriel's word, quarters were arranged inside the High Palace for Jemmethra to live in, and her new life began.</p>
