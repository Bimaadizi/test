<p>Bronwyn Daggerford was Duke Pwyll Greatshout 's sister and a court wizard in Daggerford .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bronwyn was the sister of Pwyll Greatshout . When she learned that Pwyll had been designated as the heir of Daggerford's duchy by their father Pryden Daggerford , Bronwyn decided to learn the magical arts under the court magician Gwydion pen Dafwyd . Around 1362 DR , Bronwyn went to adventure for almost two years with the adventuring party the Iron Edge .</p>
<p>When she came back, she was considerably more experienced as a wizard and more wealthy.</p>
<p>In 1370 DR , Bronwyn managed the magical duties of the court and trained militiamen in magic.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR both Bronwyn and her brother were missing or presumed dead, while a wealthy merchant and a member of the city council Matagar Bugo proclaimed himself the new Duke. Astriel Shalyn , an agent of the Lords of Waterdeep , discovered Zhentarim 's plot to instate a puppet ruler, and take over Daggerford, and for that to succeed the duke and his sister needed to disappear. Matagar Bugo claimed Bronwyn was taken hostage by Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . In reality, the siblings were kept alive in the mines of Illefarn , guarded by Zhent-controlled Griffons Mercenary Company . Astriel's activities led to the Duke and Bronwyn's rescue. The city stood against the united forces of Zhentarim and Gorgomorz , the Devil of Daggerford, who had a personal vendetta with the Daggerford's ducal family. The city stood victorious and Pwyll Greatshout and Bronwyn Daggerford were back on the throne.</p>
