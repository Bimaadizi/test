<p>Ibin Stormrider was a person in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>When the king of the goblin realm of the Kingdom of Nix was slain, Ibin Stormrider was the most dangerous of the opportunists who gathered around the dead king's throne. In order that a goblin might claim the throne, the leader of the Legendary Campaign returned to Nix to drive away Ibin and the rest in bloodforge battle.</p>
