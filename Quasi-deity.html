<p>A quasi-deity , also called a quasi-power or sometimes a hero deity , was a term to describe the lowest rank of the deities .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While not as powerful as true or widely known gods, many quasi-deities had power on par with that of a lesser deity . Some were tied to their home plane or territory, within which they could wield powers comparable to that of an intermediate deity or even a greater deity .</p>
<p>A quasi-deity once meant that a being was immortal and superior to any mortal creature. A quasi-deity's mundane movement speed was superior to that of a mortal creature. Some quasi-deities could not grant spells. True dragons who mastered the art of a dragon ascendant represented an exception, for they could grant spells to those who dedicated themselves to them. A quasi-deity was completely immune to every attempt to tamper with its mind, sap its vitality, or force it into a different form. It had a strong defense against magic but only a limited defense against heat. Weapons not enchanted with magic of an epic scope could not hurt a quasi-deity without problems. These defenses against magic, heat, and non-magical physical attacks grew stronger as a deity rose in rank.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Quasi-powers varied widely in origin and in power from one to the next. It included old or forgotten gods, local powers, and some demigods . After the events of the Second Sundering , the Dead Three became quasi-deities.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>Quasi-deities were subdivided in three categories:</p>
<p>True dragons could attain quasi-godhood by mastering the art of a dragon ascendant .</p>
<p>If a quasi-deity amassed a sufficiently high number of followers, it could then ascend to true godhood.</p>
