<p>Jasper was the quarter- halfling human servant of Benelaius , a retired War Wizard of Cormyr . He was born and raised in the village of Ghars , on the edge of the Vast Swamp . After a failed to attempt at burgling Benelaius's house on a dare in 1366 DR , he was "hired" as Benelaius's servant. He lived with Benelaius and a large number of Benelaius's cats in a house outside of Ghars, abutting the Vast Swamp.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jasper idolized the fictional detective Camber Fosrick .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a halfling ancestor in his family tree, specifically his maternal grandfather Hurthkin , which gave him his small build.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jasper was born and raised in Ghars. He had no living family, his father having died when he was seven and his mother in the spring of 1366 DR .</p>
<p>He worked as slop boy at the Sheaf of Wheat inn for 2 silver falcons a month.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1366 DR , a boast about his halfling ancestry (and its purported natural thieving ability) led him to take a bet from his friends to burglarize a house outside of Ghars and steal a trifle to prove he did it. The house had been recently bought by Benelaius, a retired War Wizard of Cormyr. The burglary went well until he chose to grab a stuffed pillow as his prize. It turned out to be one of Benelaius's many cats. The resulting cacophony of the hissing and biting cat and his screams of pain awoke Benelaius and the jig was up.</p>
<p>Given the choice of being turned over to the authorities and facing the criminal justice system of Cormyr or serving Benelaius as a servant for one year, whereupon he would receive room, board, a small stipend (1 silver falcon a month) and an education in exchange for his services, Jasper chose to serve Benelaius.</p>
<p>In 1367 DR , nearly at the end of his year-long service with Benelaius, Jasper helped the War Wizard solve a mystery that occurred in Cormyr.</p>
