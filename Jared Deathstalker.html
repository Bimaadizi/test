<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Jared Deathstalker joined a bumbling scholar from Waterdeep , Savant Gumbril , in an expedition to uncover the location of the shrine of Umgatlik. Gumbril believed Umgatlik to be a lost Netherese god. His accidental discovery reached the ears of the Church of Velsharoon and Vetrixia Nightmaiden secretly infiltrated the expedition, hoping to release the immensely powerful Netherese lich out of his ancient planar prison. The expedition discovered the ancient tomb in the Crab's Claw Coast , and Jared Deathstalker was there, ensuring the lich's continued imprisonment.</p>
<p>Vetrixia hoped to find an ally in the so-called Hero of Daggerford , offering him arcane power and ancient treasures. It was not recorded if the Hero agreed to the proposition, but that did not stop Vetrixia from returning to Gumbril and confronting Jared.</p>
<p>Within the crypt, Vetrixia Nightmaiden attempted to manipulate Savant Gumbril into doing her bidding through promises of riches and academic success. Dimwitted Gumbril was torn between dreams of a grand academic future and Jared Deathstalker's calls for the scholar's common sense. The lich could be unleashed through a simple ritual using undead bones and a special scepter upon the tomb's altar. Jared was attempting to discourage outsiders' from tampering with Umgatlik's shrine peacefully but would eagerly take up blade to slay those attempting to unleash the creature on Toril. If a Hero were to oppose the lich's return or brave enough to venture into Umgatlik's prison plane to slay Jared Deathstalker was ready to aid in the task.</p>
