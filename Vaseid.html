<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dawnmaster Vaseid was one of four high-ranking members of the clergy who served at Rosymorn Monastery sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . The other three were Seed , Stockhold , and Welkinglory . All four were depicted on a circular stained glass mosaic in an upper central chamber of the monastery. Around the mosaic were four pedestals, upon which laid each of their ceremonial weapons – masterfully crafted enchanted +1 items that were among those great works that attracted pilgrims from across Faerûn , Lathanderian and members of other faiths alike.</p>
<p>When the Blood of Lathander was stolen from Lathander's Open Hand by followers of Shar , Dawnmaster Dovaer gave the responsibility of retrieving it to then-paladin Vaseid. Vaseid tracked the thieves to the Western Heartlands , along the River Chionthar toward the Sword Coast . There, near a Sharran outpost nestled among the valleys of the river, Vaseid ambushed the Sharran thieves. During the battle the Blood of Lathander was struck and damaged by a Sharran mace, causing it to erupt light and incinerate the remainder of the Sharran forces. Vaseid deemed the artefact too unstable to transport back to Hap , even after encasing the Blood in steel "to be wielded as a most righteous cudgel". Instead, Vaseid chose to build a chapel at the site of the battle with the intent to build a true stronghold, thus founding Rosymorn Monastery and becoming its first Dawnmaster.</p>
