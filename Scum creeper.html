<p>Scum creepers were a strange, uncommon species of slug -like creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>On average a scum creeper grew to be 0.5 feet (0.15 meters) in diameter and 1 foot (0.3 meters) in length. They had fat, slimy bodies similar to slugs that were largely grey in color, with sickly white underbellies and pale yellow heads. However, they had a myriad of tiny hooked legs and suctioning segments on their underbelly that allowed them to freely crawl along walls and ceilings. Much like a leech , on the lower portion of their head was a small sucker-like mouth full of sharp, shearing plates of hornlike substance.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Much like leeches, these creatures used their mouths to fasten themselves to their prey and eat away at them until either they or their prey was dead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , scum creepers could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>The eyes on these creatures were only vestigial. They had sensory organs located in a cluster of cilia at their head. Finally, in a similar manner to both slugs and leeches, the soft flesh of a scum creeper was highly vulnerable to rock salt .</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Scum creepers were an omnivorous species, willing to eat just about anything. They were primarily known to feed upon plant growth, but would also eat rotting cloth, wood, and flesh.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Scum creepers were typically found underground and in dismal swamps where the sun 's rays barely broke through. Some were particularly known to inhabit the mid-level caverns of the Underdark .</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , these creatures were commonly found on Illithid homeworlds.</p>
