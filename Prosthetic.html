<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, a barber in Silverymoon by the name of Jooge Nopsmoth would use his expertise in dentistry to replace troublesome teeth with prosthetics made of gold, silver, or porcelain. He also offered special iron teeth, which allowed his annis hag master to eavesdrop on their wearer.</p>
<p>During this time period Arla Razortongue established the Peg and Hook in Luskan , a prosthetics shop that unusually sold hooks meant to be worn in place of a leg and pegs meant to be worn in place of a hand. She managed to convince a number of pirates to try out this unorthodox method and later on would replace one of her own hands and legs with a peg and hook respectively.</p>
