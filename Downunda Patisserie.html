<p>The Downunda Patisserie , also written as the Downunder Patisserie , was a famous bakery and home of the Chisolm family in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . It was owned and run by talented baker Jemima Chisolm , created grand cakes for the city's rich and powerful, and on two separate occasions was visited by planar beings.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood in the Burnt Gables neighborhood of the Crow's End district of Ravens Bluff, on the corner of Khalamongre Street and Jossil Street . It was a middle-class business area, and nearer the upper-class area than the poor area. It stood next door to a shop selling oarlocks and other boat fittings, owned by the Lontle family.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The stone building was L-shaped, with the end of the long arm of the L facing the street with the shopfront. It had two stories, with the ground floor given over to the business and upper floor used as a family home. Sweet smells emanated from it throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The ground floor had three main sections. The front of the building was the store and was open to the public. Here, an L-shaped counter ringed the room with large glass cabinets displaying the day's wares; there was also a bread bin. A corridor led deeper into the building. The middle of the building was a storage room, holding ingredients. At the rear was the kitchen and preparation area, with a large oven, cooling racks, and work bench. The oven was magical (and the only true magic item in the building), being able to automatically adjust its temperature so everything was baked to perfection.</p>
<p>Behind the kitchen, in the other arm of the L, was the family's private dining room and stairs up. Upstairs was a living room, furnished with couches, rug, and bookcase. Off of it was a bathroom with bathtub. From here, a corridor led down to a linen press, with doors leading off to four bedrooms for Jemima and her children. each with a bed, desk, and chair.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>All were welcome in the Downunda Patisserie, but some more than others received especially polite and personal attention. That is, Jemima worried halflings would be too tempted by her baked goods and shoplift them when she wasn't looking, so she and her children made sure to attend to them personally and politely the whole time they were present. Jemima also didn't like adventurers , so any customer who stood out as one was served politely and swiftly, so they could be out of the store sooner. Later, it was only "the adventuring type" that she worried about.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Downunda Patisserie was one of the most popular places to visit for Ravenians from outside the Burnt Gables neighborhood. City Watch officers making their rounds there always made sure to visit.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Downunda Patisserie sold fresh breads , sweet breads, pastries, pies, tarts, cookies, hand cakes, and large high-quality cakes for special occasions. Especially popular were the delicious cheese loaves straight from the oven; these were always sold out shortly after opening each morning and customers went to great lengths to get there early enough to get one. The other baked goods were only a little less popular. By closing time, the shelves were bare, leading some to affectionately call Jemima "Mother Hubbard" after a nursery rhyme from another world . There was typically a stock of one to four dozen of each item available.</p>
<p>Many of the wealthier citizens of Ravens Bluff preferred to have Jemima Chisolm prepare grand cakes for their special occasions instead of relying on their own kitchen staff. They paid handsomely for her cakes, enough to put her youngest child through school and supply her with magical enhancements to her business.</p>
<p>It was rumored that Jemima regularly baked extra batches of cakes and delivered them to poorer parts of Ravens Bluff; true or not, she was well known there, despite the fact that her wares were too expensive for poor folk.</p>
<p>The store opened just before dawn and closed at dusk.</p>
<h3>Menus</h3>
<p>The standard wares were as follows:</p>
<p>On her whims, Jemima made batches of other cakes, like rock cakes with icing made from dwarven spirits, costing 3 gp, or sponge cakes with essence of pine. Such specials were sold out within the hour. She also took special orders, with prices starting at 10 gp and with no limit but the client's purse.</p>
<p>The Sixth Anniversary Specials in 1370 DR were:</p>
<p>The Summer Specials in 1372 DR were:</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The storage room was protected by a glyph of warding that affected trespassers with a charm person spell that made them leave the store and immediately turn themselves in to Ravens Bluff's Chief Constable of the City Watch, who was Rolf Sunriver around 1370 DR . Only Jemima and Derek knew the key to bypassing the glyph . This security measure was installed by a friendly cleric as payment for a birthday cake for her bishop.</p>
<h2>Staff</h2>
<p>The Downunda Patisserie was owned and run by Jemima Chisolm , who was becoming renowned for her culinary talents. She lived above the store with her three children, Derek , Allison , and Karl . Derek and Allison, the older children, were kept busy helping their mother in the business by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy, while young Karl could not be trusted with all the sweet things to eat.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR, Jemima had recently hired members of the neighboring Lontle family to run errands buying and fetching ingredients such as flour, fruits , nuts, and sundry seasonings. Around that time, a girl named Sulene also worked the counter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jemima Chisolm and her three children arrived in Ravens Bluff. She had but one item of value in her possession, a gem , which she would use to purchase the shop. She would say nothing about where she'd come from, why she'd left, and especially where her husband was. If it wasn't baking, it wasn't anyone's business.</p>
<p>The bakery was opened around 1364 DR . The unusual name of the shop was supposedly suggested to Jemima by a bearded old mage from Shadowdale , who claimed to have traveled to "far places indeed" where there were bakeries like hers that were occasionally called "patisseries".</p>
<p>Jemima was once commissioned by a great wizard to bake an anniversary cake the likes of which had never before been seen in Ravens Bluff, and would never be seen there again. She did so with expert skill and the wizard gave her the magical oven, on the provision that she never make that cake again.</p>
<p>During Myrkyssa Jelan 's war in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , raids on barges on the River Vesper interrupted goods getting into Ravens Bluff. Among other businesses, Dowunder Patisserie lost one crate of sugar , 3 pounds (1,400 grams) red sugar, 1 pound (450 grams) each of blue and green sugar, 3 crates of flour , 3 pounds (1,400 grams) nutmeg , 2 pounds (910 grams) tumeric , 4 pounds (1,800 grams) cinnamon , 2 quarts (0.0019 cubic meters) vanilla , 1 quart (0.00095 cubic meters) lime extract, 4 quarts (0.0038 cubic meters) cherry juice, 5 quarts (0.0047 cubic meters) grape juice, 3 pounds (1,400 grams) yeast , 2 pounds (910 grams) baking soda , 4 pounds (1,800 grams) baking powder , 5 pounds (2,300 grams) sprinkles , and a jar each of anise , butterscotch , licorice , and peppermint , as well as twelve aprons . If anyone returned these, Jemima Chisolm would reward them with six-dozen double-chocolate-chip cookies.</p>
<p>In Kythorn of 1370 DR, the store had its Sixth Anniversary Celebration, with many new treats and drinks on sale. One day, whilst heading out of town to deal with kobold bandits, a group of adventurers stopped at the Downunder Patisserie for something to snack on on the way and were served by Sulene. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of Aethalynmur , a winged solar in a loincloth , who sought heroes to liberate Nimbus City in the demi-plane of Arrus . He did not require a cake. Chocolate treats from the Downunder Patisserie may have helped them gain the favor of the sylph cloud sculptor Rahmare . Later that year, Mijel Morigan visited to collect an order of two baskets of sweet bread loaves for his wife Jandra 's restaurant; he may have had adventurers in tow. If they mentioned their help in arranging the wedding of famed Vast adventurers Despherion Wolf and Lady Fawn Sweetrose Moonray Thorin , then Jemima would be very interested and, if requested, eagerly baked a black forest chocolate cake as a gift for the couple.</p>
<p>Two years later, in Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Dowunder Patisserie was again having a special event, this time to thank the heroic adventurers of the Living City with a free cup of pink lemonade and piece of sponge cake. The promotion was popular, bringing many adventurers to its door. It also brought the sylph Rahmare, riding a cloud down the street to the amazement of many, as she sought heroes to locate her lost friend Aethalynmur. And maybe some chocolate. The adventurers may have shared their baked goods with some polar werebears and might've found pastries helpful in bribing the frost giants holding Aethalynmur captive. Later, Aethalynmur would transport his saviors back to the street outside the Dowunder Patisserie, again stunning passersby.</p>
<p>Later, adventurers were discreetly recruited via Spath Investigations to work for Lady Katharine Blacktree ; one was given a note requesting them to "come alone to the entrance of the Downunder Patisserie at sunset." before being met an agent and directed elsewhere.</p>
