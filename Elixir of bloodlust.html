<p>Elixirs of bloodlust were magic potions that contained condensed savagery of a worg .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This blood-red concoction was a result of mixing together of special alchemical salts with ashes of burned worg fangs. When consumed, the potion gave the drinker ferocity of a worg that boosted the imbiber's vitality and granted them strength and speed enough for another attack after each kill in battle.</p>
