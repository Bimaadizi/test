<p>A wereleopard was an intelligent lycanthrope that could transform into a humanoid - leopard hybrid.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These shapechangers had a hybrid form that was of a humanoid shape, but with the features of a leopard (a great cat ). Wereleopards had leopard-like feet, tail, fur, and face. They were excellent at climbing and prowling stealthily, even when encumbered or moving at high speeds.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Wereleopards were hunters that were never found in groups larger than a pair. They could leap up to 15 ft (4.6 m) from a crouching position, which they used to surprise foes. Although these spotted lycanthropes were not considered powerful werecats overall, they were remarkably intelligent.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were noted to dwell near villages close to jungles.</p>
