<p>The Cuttle Command spelljammer ships were mobile bases originally built for the Unhuman Wars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cuttle Commands resembled 10-story-tall towers floating in space. Much taller than wide, they maintained their gravity plane by having large weapons on four of their eight tentacles. These tentacles would extend out far enough horizontally to change the orientation of the gravity plane to a horizontal axis running through the eyes of the Cuttle. This awkward positioning meant that these spelljammers were far less maneuverable than ordinary ships, and bulkier to boot.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Primarily designed for and used by humans , they appealed especially to wizards , due to their tower-like setup.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally built during the Unhuman Wars, from the 10 th century to the 1360s DR , they were made to be mobile command bases for the human fleets opposing the goblinkin . They were made with many of the same design techniques as the Octopus ships. After the end of the Second Unhuman War , most were either abandoned or torn up for salvage.</p>
<p>One such decommissioned ship was placed on the Rock of Bral , near the shipyards and remade into the guild hall for the Shipwrights' Guild of Bral , with its tentacles replaced by permanent structural supports instead.</p>
