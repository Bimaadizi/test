<p>Magron was an elven woman who was gruesomely killed by the hag Auntie Ethel some time during or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After her death, Magron's visage remained in one of pure, abject horror. The look was preserved on her face, for anyone who encountered her to witness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Magron appeared before Ethel with the wish of having the "mind of a genius". Unfortunately, she eventually drew Ethel's ire, "crossed" the powerful hag. Ethel decapitated Magron, positioned her head in her own hand, and displayed her corpse upright within the bowels of her fetid lair.</p>
