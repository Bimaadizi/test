<p>The Serpentsbridge was found northwest of the town of Shadowdale , set in between the Desertsmouth Mountains and Castle Daggerdale , in the midâ€“14th century DR . It provided a passage, 50 feet (15 meters) over the mighty Ashaba river along the Tethyamar Trail .</p>
<p>At first glance, the bridge appeared to be a normal, albeit weathered, stone bridge. Upon closer inspection one could see indents and ridges in the stone, which appeared to move as it if were a writhing mass of snakes . Despite its appearance, the bridge was perfectly safe to cross.</p>
