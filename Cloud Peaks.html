<p>The Cloud Peaks were a range of mountains in the west Faerûn that marked the northern border of Amn and its separation from the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>While the Cloud Peaks were a relatively small mountain range, they were very tall, with Mount Speartop at an elevation of 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) above sea level. Many steep ravines and sudden drops lay along the paths, and the winds were dangerous. The mountains were snow-covered most of the year and quite cool. Mountain climbers who could afford the cost could use the cliffs of the range for rock climbing. The southwestern foothills were known as the Hamlar Hills .</p>
<h2>Fauna</h2>
<p>Many sheep and goats roamed and grazed the foothills of the Cloud Peaks, and remorhazes were among the apex predators of the region. Winter wolves were also endemic, and hunted for their pelts.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The mountains were thoroughly mined for iron , gems , and precious metals. The nearby town of Crimmor processed a good portion of the ore and gems coming from the Peaks before shipping them to Athkatla .</p>
<p>The foothills of the Cloud Peaks near Crimmor were home to the first tree farms of Faerûn , which produced ash , oak , duskwood and silverbark .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Tribes of ogres and hill giants lived in the mountains, as did a family of cloud giant bandits until they were eliminated in 1342 DR .</p>
<p>White dragons inhabited the mountains as well. One such white dragon was named Icehaupt , who lived on Mount Speartop but preferred to never leave his lair.</p>
<p>Until 1369 DR , an ancient red dragon also lived in the mountains, but it was slain by the blue dragon Araugauthos , who then returned to her own lair.</p>
