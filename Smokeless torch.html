<p>A smokeless torch was a form of illumination used in remote areas of Faer√ªn such as Laothkund in the Unapproachable East or Adama's Tooth in the Shining South . In both cases it was found underground, in wizards' abodes, where no expense was spared. Though bright, they generated uneven light.</p>
