<p>The Shadow Weave , also referred to as The Dark Lady's Weave , was a corrupting force of magic similar to, based on, and dependent on the Weave . Like Shar herself, the Shadow Weave was a force based upon nothingness, a kind of "negative" magic derived from the places where mystic energies had been before being drawn in by the Weave. While the Weave could be considered a loose latticework running throughout reality, the Shadow Weave was the pattern formed by the negative space in between.</p>
<h2>Nature of the Shadow Weave</h2>
<p>The Shadow Weave's relation to the Weave could be described in many terms. If the Weave could be defined as the natural flows of the energies of the world, the Shadow Weave was the embodiment of the return flows. It was like veins compared to the true Weave's heart, the conductive coating around a bright conduit of energy. It could varyingly be described as leaning on, calling on, being built on, clinging to, feeding off, and echoing the Weave. In short, it was a "shadow" of the Weave, and by its very nature as a shadow could never be greater than the Weave itself, although it did prove superior in select areas, such as compulsion and destruction.</p>
<h2>Using the Shadow Weave</h2>
<p>The secrets that the Shadow Weave was based upon were disquieting, maddening, and otherwise dangerous to the mortal mind. A spellcaster who wanted to manipulate the Shadow Weave had to either worship Shar or make some sort of arrangement with Shar and their existing patron deity or otherwise permanently lose a piece of their mind.</p>
<p>A shadow adept was a spellcaster who specialized in using the Shadow Weave. Wielders of shadow magic could use the Shadow Weave as a source for their power just as they could be drawing directly from the Plane of Shadow . Absolute masters of the Weave (such as all of the Chosen of Mystra or the wizard god Azuth ) could see how the Shadow Weave relied on the Weave, and so work through the Shadow Weave to cast spells.</p>
<p>The Shadow Weave was best suited for dark magic that drained life or muddled the mind and the senses, but less suited for magic that manipulated energy or matter. Spells from the schools of enchantment , illusion , and necromancy were enhanced, while those from the schools of evocation and transmutation were impaired. The Shadow Weave was also superior for fueling spells that created darkness , while it was impossible to use it to create light of any kind .</p>
<p>Since the Shadow Weave was a separate force of magic, it was not affected by areas of dead magic or wild magic within the Weave. An antimagic field however countered all magic within its area, and that included Shadow Weave magic. Shadow Weave users had to also overcome any spell resistance a creature might have. It was harder for a Weave user to perceive, counter, or dispel spells created by using the Shadow Weave, but at the same time it was also harder for a Shadow Weave user to affect spells created using the Weave. Any magic item created using the Shadow Weave was a Shadow Weave item and was affected by the same benefits and limitations as a Shadow Weave spell.</p>
<p>In the absence of the Weave, the Shadow Weave was much wilder and less controllable for its users.</p>
<h2>Practitioners</h2>
<p>There were a large number of wielders of shadow magic in south Faer√ªn around the time of 1372 DR. Although none would admit to skill in the art, there were rumors of a growing shadow cult within the Council of Elders of Halruaa , and that they planned on attempting to overthrow the followers of Mystra and Azuth . Further rumblings in the area had the Conclave of Halruaa on the verge of exposing and bringing this group to justice, while others had the two organizations in league with one another.</p>
<p>As Vhaeraun was the drow patron of shadow magic , he worked together with Shar in projects that concerned this magic. One was the School of the Shadow Weave , which had followers of both Vhaeraun and Shar among them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Shadow Weave originated from Shar rather than from Mystryl ; Shar studied the Weave in ancient times and created her own dark distorted version. Though the Shadow Weave had existed for quite some time (at least several millennia), only around 1372 DR did it become known and widely used.</p>
<p>Though Shar sought to use Mystra 's death to replace the Weave with the Shadow Weave, she had miscalculated; just as the Weave collapsed with the death of Mystra, so too did the Shadow Weave.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Shadow Weave, Mystra altered herself to make rebuilding it nigh-impossible, but did not prevent its reappearance. The Shadow Weave persisted still, returning with the Weave, and since the Second Sundering had ebbed and flowed in strength, making it less reliable than the normal Weave. Its existence did not increase Mystra's strength, but ironically made Shar more dependent on the goddess of magic than she was before.</p>
