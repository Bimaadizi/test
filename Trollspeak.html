<p>Trollspeak , also referred to as the Trollish tongue , was an exonym term used by other races to refer to the many and varied mixed languages that were developed and spoken by all manner of trolls .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rather than possessing a single racial language like many creatures on Toril , trolls spoke a variety of different mixed languages. Typified by a rather guttural speech, these tongues were mishmashes of corrupted loan words and phrases from other languages. The languages that Trollspeak typically loaned from were Common , Daraktan , Ghukliak , Hobgoblin , and Jotun . Trollspeak was also highly transient or regional, thus trolls from one area only had a one-in-fourth chance of understanding the Trollspeak of trolls from another area, such as the Trollspeak of the Troll Hills versus the Trollspeak of Thar .</p>
