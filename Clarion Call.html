<p>The Clarion Call was a temple dedicated to Persana in the aquatic elf city of Myth Nantar .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This temple stood in the Law Quarter of Myth Nantar. Like all temples in Myth Nantar, there was a 20‑foot (6.1‑meter) perimeter around the building that was free of coral . The coral that grew around this boundary, which was clearly defined as if moving around a force field, was always as smooth as silk .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Clarion Call was a temple made of blue marble , supported by pillars of carved bubbles, that stood two stories tall. On its front face was a massive frieze that depicted a triton astride a giant sea horse and blowing a horn.</p>
<h3>Interiors</h3>
<p>Inside of this temple were said to be feats of engineering that rivaled those of the pyramids of the Raurin desert .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Though there were few tritons in Myth Nantar, even in the city's heyday, there were many Dukars who worshiped at the Clarion Call as they felt the deity 's philosophies of building and guardianship were in tune with their own.</p>
