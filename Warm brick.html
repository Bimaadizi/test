<p>Warm bricks were a type of enchanted brick created by an unknown, young enchantress prior to circa 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These looked like average bricks with dimensions that were 1 ft (0.3 m) x 1 ft (0.3 m) x 2 ft (0.61 m).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>As their name implied, these bricks were enchanted to radiate heat. A single brick radiated enough to warm everything within a 10 feet (3 meters) radius, maintaining a temperature of around 65‒70 ℉ (18‒21 ℃ ). This depended upon weather conditions, as they were inert until the natural air temperature was below 60 ℉ (16 ℃ ) and would radiate more heat the colder conditions became.</p>
