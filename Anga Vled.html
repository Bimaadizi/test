<p>Anga Vled was a village of gnomes in the Fields of the Dead of the Western Heartlands , circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This farming community was located on the north bank of the River Chionthar , west of Elturel . It took about a day to reach the village on horseback from Elturel.</p>
<p>Anga Vled was among the gnome settlements linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Anga Vled was on a caravan route and traded mainly in food. Produce from this village included asparagus , carrots , marrows , parsnips, and radishes. They also made a bread with spiced vegetables, and a very strong parsnip wine. Around 1370 DR, there were two gnomes skilled at training, shoeing , and healing horses. Occasionally, they had horses to trade or sell, typically when a merchant or traveler had to move on, leaving behind a sick or injured mount in their care. There was also a wheelwright, by name and by trade.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>All around the land side of the city were small ring-shaped forts made of earth where folks could quickly set up a defense against the various hazards of life on the plains. Goblins , hobgoblins , bugbears , and even trolls were known to roam and plunder the area, not to mention the human bandit gangs that prowled the plains.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the early 1370s DR, Gudelmer Wheelwright was the most well-known member of this community. His skill at making and repairing wagons garnered him quite a reputation among those who passed through Anga Vled on a regular basis.</p>
