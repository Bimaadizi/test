<p>Gutterspites were a variation of raggamoffyn composed of a mass of pieces of rope , leather, and cloth holding together a central mass of glass gemstones , and glitter.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.</p>
<p>Gutterspites were large enough to bond with dwarves and gnomes but not elves or humans . In fact, gutterpsites were the only variation of raggamoffyn that could capture gnomes and duergar .</p>
<p>They could create a blinding burst of light that affected all targets within a 20 feet (6.1 meters) radius. The blindness from this attack last for several minutes. Gutterspites were unaffected by the following spells : color spray , darkness , light , rainbow , and continual light .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>These creatures preferred to remain with the host they captured at their birth. The were unique among raggamoffyns in that they willingly cooperated with their host provided their goals were met.</p>
