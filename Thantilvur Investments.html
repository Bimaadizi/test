<h2>Structure</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thantilvur Investments was commissioned to be built in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR by Braethan Cazondur , a Lord of Waterdeep who kept his connection to the building a secret. He murdered the crew of builders who had installed the collapsing ceiling with poisoned elverquisst and had Shrikegulk dispose of their bodies. He would later use it as the site of an ambush against Laeral Silverhand and was able to crush the Open Lord under the collapsing ceiling, however Laeral would later return in the body of Elminster . The building was completely destroyed in the magical battle that ensued, which involved Vajra Safahr , Qasmult , Glenmaur, and the returned Laeral.</p>
