<p>The Iron Thorn , also known as the Cursed Ring of Slight Monsterism , were cursed rings that made wearers appear as horrifying decaying undead creatures.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These cursed rings were bands of iron that looked damaged, as if stained and burned by acid. The band itself was formed to resemble two iron thorns that held a crude lump of silver in the middle, reminiscent of a white skull on a black background, the symbol of Myrkul , Lord of Bones.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Iron Thorn was a cursed item that changed the wearer appearance to that of a zombie , drastically reducing their charisma. Apart from the appearance, the ring reduced the wearer's movement speed to that of a shambling undead. Once put on a finger, the the Iron Thorn could only be removed by a component cleric or via the remove curse spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several of these rings could be found in the bandit camp of Mulahey who was instrumental in creating the Iron crisis of 1368 DR . Another such ring was stashed away in Cloak Wood forest outside of Baldur's Gate , in the Centeol 's spider nest.</p>
