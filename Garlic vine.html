<p>Garlic vine was a hybrid plant created by Rab Bitnez of Liam's Hold circa 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garlic vine was a resilient and strong climbing vine plant. It was able to thrive in any climate and did not need soil. Rab Bitnez kept the vines in his home lab in Liam's Hold climbing on the wall over simmering water pools. The vine bore heads of regular garlic as if it were a fruit.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Rab intended the hybrid vine to promote the popularity and consumption of his favorite garlic all across the Realms even the places where regular garlic plants could not grow.</p>
