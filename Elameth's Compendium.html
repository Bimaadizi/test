<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Penned by the elven enchanter Elameth of Five Trees, the Compendium collected technical knowledge and numerous sketches of a variety of magical artifacts.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elameth's Compendium was written and printed sometime between the citadel's construction circa 900 DR and its fall in the Battle of Seldarine's Hand . By 1281 DR , the citadel was ruined and inhabited by ghostly apparitions of its former inhabitants. One of the Elameth's Compendium copies could be found in the citadel's library curated by Custhantos , along with other rare books.</p>
