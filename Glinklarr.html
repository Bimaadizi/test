<p>Glinklarr was a type of musical instrument that combined the design of a wind and a stringed instrument.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical glinklarr was a tiny horn -like instrument of carved wood or sometimes made of metal. It was a variation of a mouth-organ with two inner reeds that vibrated as the breath was passed through it, similarly to a kazoo . Glinklarr ended in a thin "snout" that was the sound output, which had from four to six fine strings that were strung over the opening. The musician plucked the strings with one hand while holding the horn to their lips and blowing. The air passed through glinklarr producing music, subtly modifying glissandos, chords, and "warbling" tremolo, produced by the instrument.</p>
