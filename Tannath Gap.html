<p>The Tannath Gap , often called just The Gap , was a forested highland between the Tannath Mountains and the rest of the Dragonjaw Mountains , around the River Umber , opposite Singing Sands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Gap was a narrow forest with damp, soft soil. The climate was cool and pleasant, and the River Umber wound down the middle of the Gap.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The area was covered with blue-needle pine and fir . The largest mammal seemed to be deer : there were raccoons , foxes , opossums , badgers and squirrels . Otters and beavers lived in the bodies of water, and birds such as hawks , herons and crows were present as well. The predators included cougars .</p>
<p>There were few enchanted creatures in the Gap; griffons from the Tannath Mountains flew over at some times. Cath shee , believed to be descended from the original elven inhabitants, were also known to exist there as of 1368 DR . It was believed monsters had been hunted to extinction in the region.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As of 1372 DR , the River Umber had become a major trade road in the region. People downstream on Aglarond preferred not to fish there, distrusting the Thayans upstream.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Aglarondans rarely patrolled the Gap, believing the terrain to be sufficiently disuassive to most invaders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hunters claimed to have killed a "globular", possibly a deepspawn , some years before in 1368 DR .</p>
<p>In 1365 DR , an Aglarondan force returned to Aglarond through the Gap after pushing an enemy Thayan force out of Shyvar Pass in order to flank another Thayan force as it attacked Emmech.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , Vunmal Murn of Phsant fomented a rivalry between her home city and Aglarond over the Tannath Gap.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A small clan of werefoxes was believed to be hunting in the woods as of 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Woodcutters and hunters lived along the piedmont, making their homes in small cottages.</p>
