<p>Valdemar was a young green dragon that dwelled inside of Wyllowwood , within the subterranean dungeon complex known as Undermountain , during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<p>While Valdemar was originally used by the druid Wyllow to ward off adventurers that sought their fortune within Undermountain, a life-changing event altered the dragon's perspective and it became a permanent fixture within the ecology of Wyllowwood. After this, the dragon began to refer to itself as Tearulai .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Valdemar was used by Wyllow as a guardian of her domain during the 14 th century, it claimed a section of her forest domain as its own. During these years, Valdemar maintained an exceptionally cautions nature and had a pack of worgs and a mischief of rats as its forest spies.</p>
<p>Sometime prior to the Year of the Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Valdemar was assaulted by an adventurer and was impaled by the intelligent sword , Tearulai , which became embedded within its skull.</p>
