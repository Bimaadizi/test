<p>The First Dynasty was a Talfiric noble family from Ebenfar that served as chieftains of the first humans to settle in the Moonshae Isles , becoming the first of the Ffolk .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The First Dynasty were descendants of the Archduke Markus Randol of Ebenfar . When tribes of Talfir came to be prosecuted by Ebenfar's Shadowking in the Year of the Executioner, 140 DR , Randol's daughter, Gwynneth , led the tribes west across the Sea of Swords to settle in the Moonshae Isles. They were said to have first arrived on Alaron but founded their first settlement on the large southern island which would be named in Gwynneth's honor . The site they chose would come to be known as Caer Corwell , but soon other cantrevs were founded as well. The first settlers rapidly built fortifications in anticipation of being pursued by their enemies, however no such enemies ever arrived. They were soon joined by additional waves of migration as word of their freedom spread.</p>
<p>Gwynneth died soon after her arrival in the Isles, and was succeeded in the Year of the Impenetrable Mystery, 141 DR , by her consort, Taylor , who would die in battle when the settlers came into conflict with the local Llewyrr elves in the Year of the Fear and Flame, 144 DR . After five years of conflict, Gwynneth and Taylor's son, Deric , successfully united the humans to found the kingdom of Corwell in the Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR . By this time, the Talfiric settlers had already come to be known as the "Ffolk", which simply meant "the people" in their language .</p>
<p>While King Deric managed to unite the Ffolk and to establish peace with the elves during his two decades of rule, he died without an heir. This ended the First Dynasty and precipitated a six-year civil war among the Ffolk, which only ended with the victory of Callidyrr Hugh , who founded the Hugh Dynasty .</p>
