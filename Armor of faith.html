<p>Armor of faith was a type of enchanted magical armor that, during creation, had been consecrated by the clergy of a specific deity . These included a variety of armors including leather , chain , and plate mail among others and were popular among clerics , druids , paladins , and even some rangers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The breastplate or chest protector of the armor often bore the holy symbol of the deity to which it was devoted, though this was not always the case.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Armor of faith offered magical protection like other magical armors, from +1 to +5 . When worn, it projected an aura around the wearer that was visible to similarly aligned people of the same faith. To these observers, the wearer appeared as an ally, of a similar mindset who shared in their cause. To onlookers that shared their religion, but not alignment, the sameness of faith would be clearly evident.</p>
<p>The alignment of the armor, detectable by a know alignment spell , was the same as the deity to which it was dedicated and, as such, it could only be worn by people of this faith who shared this alignment. If anyone who did not meet these requirements donned the armor, it would damage them until it was removed.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>The ranger Seffer Ekr possessed a set of +3 chainmail , blessed as armor of faith , which exemplified his favor in the eyes of Mielikki . The armor, as well as a promise from the Forest Queen, protected Seffer's life for many years, allowing him to die from a heart attack, rather than at the blade of an opponent. At some point, this set of mail passed to Sir Sarles of Athkatla .</p>
