<p>Rot trolls were a type of troll imbued with necrotic energy .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A rot troll's flesh peeled off from the skin as soon as it formed, and the troll's body withered constantly.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Unlike a normal troll, a rot troll eventually lost its ability to regenerate, but it still healed properly. The monster was pulsing with necrotic energy, which was emitted from its withering shape.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Due to a rot troll's rancid degeneration, standing too close to it exposed other creatures to its deadly emanations. Only acid or fire could stop this necrotic radiation.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>During regeneration, a normal troll could become infected with waves of necrotic energy and form a symbiotic connection with that deathly force.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Rot trolls could be found in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast North .</p>
