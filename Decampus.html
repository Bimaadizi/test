<h2>History</h2>
<p>Decampus was born in 2277 NY (−1582 DR) . At the young age of thirteen, the talented arcanist developed the alarm spell. After this, she travelled to the well-known enclaves of Ioulaum and Seventon to study at the universities there. However, she became weary of the conflicts between the power-hungry arcanists. Thus, in 2363 NY (−1496 DR) , she left Ioulaum's enclave and became a wanderer. In a spell battle with archwizard Delzjhava , the Singing Lady died in 2693 NY (−1166 DR) at the old age of 416.</p>
