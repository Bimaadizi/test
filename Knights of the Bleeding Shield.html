<p>The Knights of the Bleeding Shield were a knightly order devoted to the Ilmater , the Broken God, and affiliated with the Church of Ilmater .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1265 DR , Archsufferer Bloirt Waelarn of the House of the Broken God in Keltar had denounced the Ilmatari priests of the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum for refusing to relinquish the Tome of Torment , the holiest book of the faith, and declared them degenerate, mentally ill heretics. The Mussum priests and the Companions of the Noble Heart attacked Waelarn and his followers, labeling them "false clerics" and "subverted by evil". An angry Waelarn summoned the Knights of the Bleeding Shield, as well as the Holy Warriors of Suffering and the Order of the Golden Cup , to his side and vowed holy war against the "unclean ones of Mussum" and their allies. The war saw the violent clashes of Holy Hill Farm in 1266 DR and Bronsheir's Charge and Weeping Rock in 1267 DR . Finally, Lord Sir Jargus Holenhond of the Golden Cup called an end to the bloodshed between true believers, insisted that the Tome of Torment be transferred to Keltar as planned, and blamed Bloirt Waelarn for the senseless violence, determining that he should be removed from office and sent into hermitage for the remainder of his years. The weary paladins accepted and carried out his judgment.</p>
