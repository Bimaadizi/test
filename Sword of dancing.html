<p>A sword of dancing , also called a dancing sword , was an enchanted weapon that provided varying degrees of assistance in striking and harming an enemy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These magic weapons could be found as any type of sword .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A sword of dancing made it easier to strike and harm an opponent. Among some versions of the item, this enchantment got stronger over the course of several minutes before "resetting" itself. In addition to this, the wielder could release the sword at any point and allow it to "dance", allowing the sword to attack enemies within 30 feet (9.1 meters) without being wielded by hand. The weapon would fall to the ground while dancing if the wielder moved more than 30 feet (9.1 meters) away from it. Depending on the enchantment, a dancing sword could do this for only a limited time, sometimes less than thirty seconds and sometimes for several minutes before needing to return to the wielder's hand to recharge for several more minutes before it could dance again.</p>
<p>Some dancing swords would not dance for their wielder unless they spoke a special command word.</p>
