<p>Uldinath's Arms was a smithy in the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR . A longtime staple of Triboar, the shop was in the family's name for generations and known for high quality.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Although a swordsmith by trade, Aldenar produced an impressive range of high-quality smithwork of all kinds that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast . Their eyebolts , latches , nails , and pins supported Wainwright's Wagons and all Triboar's wainwrights in their success. Though the prices were slightly cheaper than normal, the metal and workmanship were to a higher standard. In the late 15 th century DR, it sold fine weapons that were stamped with the Uldinath family glyph, which meant they typically sold for 25% more than the typical price.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It stood atop a hill in the far northeastern side of town, on the east side of the Long Road opposite Foehammer's Forge . Foehammer's and Uldinath's maintained a long-standing but friendly rivalry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded by Aldenar Uldinath and was in business by the mid-1360s DR.</p>
<p>By 1485 DR , it was run by his great-granddaughter, Harriet Uldinath .</p>
