<p>A pen , also called an ink pen , was a writing utensil and drawing device.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The standard inkpen was a stick of wood fitted with a special tip that drew up ink when dipped into it.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Pens were used to transfer ink to paper , usually by scholars to scribe books and diplomats to write and sign contracts. Special forgery pens were produced for those who wanted to alter documents with precision. Wizards oft bought magnets to hold their ink pens. Simple pens were included in map-making kits .</p>
<p>Pens were symbols of authority in Kara-Tur and represented two of the nine Gifts of the Faith . Golden pens represented writing and jade pens represented history. Pen schools that taught art were even known the exist in the eastern continent, particularly the one founded by Shen Shou .</p>
<p>Quill pens were used as material components for several spells , both divine and arcane . However, if one wanted to scribe a magical scroll, special types of pens would be needed, such as quills made from magical beasts.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<p>There were several types of ink pen, from simple goose feather quills to special metal-nibbed pens. They ranged in price depending on the quality of the pen. Standard ink pens cost just 2 cp each, but deluxe metal nibs imported from Kara-Tur sold for 70 gp a set. More modern pens were designed to hold reservoirs of ink, so that they did not need to be continuously dipped in ink, unlike quills.</p>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<p>Spells could be use to replicate the effect of a pen and ink. The amanuensis spell created an animated pen to duplicate magical writing. The magical pen could write just as quick as the caster, and the caster did not even have to be present.</p>
