<p>Chayne Mulish was a dwarf commander of Citadel Adbar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , he was part of the doomed Adbar expedition led by King Bromm , which was attacked by orcs of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows . Before battle was joined, Chayne and Oretheo Spikes rallied the dwarves' battle spirit, a task Bromm thought few were better suited to. Chayne died as the main enemy force appeared, his head smashed by a frost giant –thrown boulder while he carried out King Bromm's command for an orderly withdrawal. His last words were "For the love o' ye Ma's hairy back, back and stay tight!"</p>
