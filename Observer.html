<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Observers were somewhat larger than ordinary beholders, being about 6 ft (1.8 m) in diameter. They had only six eyestalks and three central eyes spaced evenly around their circumference, and three mouths, one situated beneath each central eye. The mouths were actually suckers attached to 5 ft (1.5 m) tentacles. The body itself was covered in hard, chitinous skin that was mottled with shades of purple and pink.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Observers were the most socially adept of the beholderkin and the most ready to ally with other creatures, but they completely lacked empathy despite not being actually malicious. They were near-obsessive in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Observers were known to have psionic powers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In its heyday, the observers were among the creatures that came through the magical gates to trade in the city of Sarbreen .</p>
