<p>A catstaff was a magical weapon and item that granted thief -like abilities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The typical catstaff was a 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) quarterstaff made of stout, black wood. It contained secret compartments for carrying small items ( e.g. , thieves' tools and material spell components ) and was topped with a sculpted cat -head knob. Using it as a weapon did not disrupt or prevent any of its magical effects.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The bearer of a catstaff was imbued with a thief's skill at stealth and climbing walls (provided both hands were free), along with the ability to see in the ultraviolet spectrum out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters). They could also cast shadow six times per day, creating a 10 feet (3 meters) radius globe of semidarkness for ten to fifty minutes that blocked the bearer from vision and, thus, gazes and other visual attacks. A catstaff lost all of its magical powers if it was broken in two.</p>
