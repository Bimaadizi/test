<p>The lighthouse of Port Nyanzaru , Chult , was used to guide ships into port and to send smoke signals along the coast of the Bay of Chult .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The lighthouse was located in the Harbor Ward at the mouth of the harbor itself, immediately across the harbor entrance from Fort Nyanzaru . It served to anchor the mighty chain that could be used to close access to the port.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The beacon at the top of the lighthouse maintained a constant signal flame that was visible through the dark of night, rain, and fog, and served to guide ships into port. This beacon made the docks of the Harbor Ward a safer place to do business than the outer docks in the Tiryki Anchorage .</p>
<p>In times of pirate attack, the beacon's color was changed to a bright red to warn the people of the city. At night, this light was bright enough to bathe the entire harbor in an eerie red glow.</p>
<p>The fire of the lighthouse could also be used to send smoke signals that were visible from anywhere on the Bay of Chult, from the mines in the northwest to Fort Beluarian in the northeast. These signals were created by adding various powders to the flames, which produced thick columns of colorful smoke.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the fiendish pirate Idrianne Smoke during the events of the death curse in the late 1400s DR , the lighthouse's crimson beacon provided the city with its first warning of her approach.</p>
