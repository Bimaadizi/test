<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Poscadari believed that they were created by the gods in a land of perpetual snow and ice, but a mighty shaman led them south where they first met and traded with the ancestors of the Azuposi.</p>
<p>There were rumors that the ancestors of the Poscadari built Esh Alakar and its accompanying bridge. However, the elves were silent on the matter.</p>
