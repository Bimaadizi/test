<p>Fjord was a Netherese arcanist and spell inventor who lived during the Shadowed Age .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Fjord developed their first spell, they designed a staff in 3301 NY (−558 DR) that would become know as Fjord's Stave of Sentience . This staff caused plants to grow instantly, though if used incorrectly, could cause plants to become sentient. These plants could become mobile, and would attack those who had previously caused them harm.</p>
<p>Fjord developed three spells during their life. The spells they developed were vacancy in 3327 NY (−532 DR) , airy water in 3328 NY (−531 DR) , distance distortion in 3340 NY (−519 DR) and finally, animate dead in 3345 NY (−514 DR) .</p>
