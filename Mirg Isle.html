<p>Mirg Isle was an island and a pirate stronghold in the Pirate Isles . It had two ports.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The island was originally under the control of Xenz , a pirate allied with Zhentil Keep , but Vurgrom the Mighty seized power by defeating Xenz in combat. A whirlpool sank twenty-five of Vurgrom's ships and significantly lowered the power he exerted on the island. Vurgrom's alliance with Iakhovas caused his power to be diminished to the point where he lost control of the island. Some of Mirg Isle's inhabitants speculated that the true ruler was once again Xenz.</p>
