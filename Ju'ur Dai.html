<p>The Ju'ur Dai was one of the tribes of the Bedine people that dwelled within the sands of Anauroch during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In an act of betrayal against their fellow tribesmen, the Ju'ur Dai aligned themselves with the Zhentarim during the mercenary organization's attempt to take by force a stretch of land across Anauroch.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ja'ur Dai accompanied Sabkhat el Talab in his search for the missing caravans at some point, and some others of the same tribe were the guides of the adventurers sent by Cormyr to find the sage.</p>
<p>When the Zhentarim began manipulating and even assailing the Bedine tribes in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the Ju'ur Dai was the only tribe that did not unify under the common cause of maintaining their freedom from foreign influence. They even shared with the Zhent agents the secret location of Elah'zad , the oasis that was home to a sacred temple of the Bedine.</p>
<p>In an act even more foul, the Ju'ur Dai aided the Zhents in the poisoning of a Bedine oasis and their fellow tribesmen. The Ju'ur Dai faced justice in the end, however, as they were butchered by the Zhentarim at the ruined city of Orofin , after they were no longer needed by the malevolent outlanders.</p>
