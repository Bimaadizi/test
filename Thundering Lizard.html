<p>The Thundering Lizard was a notable inn and tavern in Port Nyanzaru , Chult . Visiting adventurers were often referred there if they wanted a place to go for a raucous time.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn occupied a street corner in Port Nyanzaru's Market Ward near the Red Bazaar on the slope of Mount Sibasa .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Thundering Lizard was recognizable by the tables and benches spilling out onto the street, and by the painted tyrannosaurus skull that hung above the main entrance. The roof was fitted with several rain traps to collect fresh rainwater.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern had low, 7‑foot-high (2.1‑meter) ceilings that were stained with tobacco and a floor coated in sawdust . It was well-lit with oil lamps yet dark and cool relative to the harsh Chultan sun . A kitchen and pantry sat in a backroom behind the bar, with a staircase leading down into a dimly lit cellar supported by four columns and filled with numbered casks .</p>
<p>The simple guestrooms had sawdust floors.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Thundering Lizard attracted a raucous and rough clientele seeking hard drinks, bar fights, and sex. It was nevertheless an inviting place, full of loud laughter and off-key music . It smelled faintly of vomit and stale beer .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>In addition to tavern services, the Thundering Lizard offered rooms for five silver pieces per night. It was also one of the main places in Port Nyanzaru to solicit the services of wilderness guides (in addition to Kaya's House of Repose and the Harbormaster's Office ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the late 15 th century DR , a smuggler named Pelican Jake stole a cursed treasure from the dreaded pirate Idrianne Smoke . Terrified of retribution, he hid it behind a secret door inside the Thundering Lizard's cellar. When Smoke's infernal forces stormed the Market Ward years later to seek Jake and the treasure, one of her champions—a minotaur known as Captain Walharrow —violently seized control of the inn.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , the Thundering Lizard was a favorite drinking and meeting spot for the Harper spymaster known as Soggy Wren .</p>
