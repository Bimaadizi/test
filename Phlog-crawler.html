<p>A phlog-crawler was an eldritch lifeform living in wildspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phlog-crawlers resembled elongated clouds with limbs, most often eight, which made them look somewhat like spiders . They shimmered in many colors as they moved.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>The creatures attacked living things by wrapping around them and absorbing their lifeforce. They avoided open flames, except when their hunger was indeed great.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Being amorphous and nearly weightless, they could slip through any crevice.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A phlog-crawler absorbed a target's lifeforce in a manner that reduced their physical strength; most people would last maybe ten minutes in contact with one of them, or more if they were stronger or more resistant to death magic. The creatures were barely affected by physical weapons, but fire instantly slew them on contact, having similar results to a rather basic fireball .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Living both in wildspace and the phlogiston , the phlog-crawlers preferred the former for its abundance of prey. According to Torilian sages, these creatures may have been immortal. They could endure up to a day-length within an atmosphere, and the atmospheric envelopes of any object under one naval ton that were in contact with it turned into hazards in half the time.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>It was said that in distant spheres, a captive phlog-crawler was likely a suitable ingredient for a potion of longevity .</p>
