<p>Their leader was murdered and usurped by Chessentan half-elf mercenary named Furifax . Over time he placed agents within every major city of Unther, inciting dissent among the populace and spying on the activities of royalty. He sought to unite all the other bandit tribes within the Eastern Shaar in a united attacked against the land of Unther. His efforts were often met with little success, though in the process he attracted the attention of the Cult of Tiamat . He eventually came to form an alliance with the cult.</p>
<p>Around 1358 DR , the tribe captured some small Untheric outposts that stood along the River of Swords and freed the slaves of farms that stood along the River Angol .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
