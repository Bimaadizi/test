<p>Kola bint Fayala was a retired thief and locksmith who lived in Huzuz in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kola was a young gnome who had a harassed look about her.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Kola setup up shop in the Warehouse District where she made locks that the wealthy merchants used for both their homes and places of business.</p>
<p>Kola made mundane locks, but also used her magical abilities to craft special locks. One of her favorites yelled the word "Thief!" twelve times if the lock was ever opened without using the key. Another of her styles was equipped with spring-loaded needles that could be poisoned. One of her locks was so mechanically complex that all but the most skilled thieves were unable to open it. Lastly, she made a lock that did not have a keyhole, opening only when the correct command word was spoken.</p>
