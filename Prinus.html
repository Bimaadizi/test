<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prinus lurked in Uthe Lodge along with the other wood woads Robur and Falcata around the same time as the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar . They served and protected the maddened dryad Sylvie , who was the source of the plant overgrowth. The wood woads, the dryad, and other plant and animal life in the Lodge had been twisted by the druid Halsaime , who had infected the ranger Peron Uthe and allowed him to spread the disease.</p>
