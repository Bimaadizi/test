<p>The River Angol was a long and swift river found in the Greenfields in southern Unther .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The River Angol was formed by a network of streams on the northern Unthangol Mountains that flowed east across the Greenfields before draining into the Alamber Sea . Its waters provided sediment for the fertile lands of the Greenfields, but the river was unpredictable in its floods, much like the River Alamber .</p>
<p>The river disappeared after the violent changes in the southern region of Unther, that occurred because of the Spellplague of 1385 DR .</p>
