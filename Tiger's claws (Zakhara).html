<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tiger's claws were straps or gloves fitted with spikes, around four to five attached to a metal crossbar, with a ring at each end. This bar was connected along the wearer's palm and back of hand by a metal strip that was attached to another bracelet-type bar that went around the wearer’s wrist.</p>
<p>The claws were were situated in such a way that they emerged between a wearer's fingers whenever they made a fist, and were generally wielded like a pair of brass knuckles.</p>
