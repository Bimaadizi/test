<h2>History</h2>
<p>About two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Elryn had become a Dreadspell; he was then sent to capture or slay a Chosen of Mystra near Westgate . Immediately after teleporting, they came to a shrine of Shar near the Dead Place , where they picked up the woodsman Uldus Blackram and had him work as their guide.</p>
<p>Coercion became necessary, and Uldus Blackram led them with a sword and knife to his back, as well as a noose tied around his neck to make sure he didn't miss any reminders. During the first leg of their trip, they came across Ilbryn Starym , an elven wizard , and quickly turned violent; though Ilbryn escaped, he first slew Uldus Blackram, and one of the Dreadspells, Iyrindyl, was slain during the fight.</p>
<p>Once they found the ruin, Karsus' Keep and Vaelam stumbled upon the way to access the inside, Elryn led the looting. The team of Dreadspells then sought to bring down the whole ruin on top of two people they spotted, a self-styled god Azuth and the Chosen of Mystra they sought, by using all their looted magic to hurl destructive spells at them. Once their looted magic failed against Azuth, despite bringing down the ruin, they fled.</p>
<p>When Dread Sister Klalaera appeared and herded them back against Azuth, they were stopped partway by Umbregard and Starsunder , two mages that appeared suddenly. During the battle, they were eliminated one by one, until Elryn alone remained; he was slain by a third archmage, Tenthar Taerhamoos of the Phoenix Tower .</p>
