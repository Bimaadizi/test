<p>The Royal Gorget of Battle was an enchanted gorget in possession of the royal family of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The powers, while nondescript, were largely defensive in nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gorget was loaned by Elminster Aumar , wizard and Chosen of Mystra , to King Palaghard Obarskyr I of Cormyr before his reign to ensure his safety. Palaghard in turn let it be worn by his wife Enchara , with Elminster's blessing. Afterwards, it was left in the Warhorn Room , displayed as a state treasure of Cormyr.</p>
<p>On Mirtul 5 of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Elminster stole the Gorget from its display case, unaware that Vainrence had cast a tracing spell on it. He then fed the energies of the Gorget to the Simbul , who required magical energies from items periodically to remain sane, as a result of the Spellplague ; this destroyed the device. The tracing spell eventually drew a force of mages bearing orders to retrieve the Gorget or utterly annihilate Elminster; they persisted in this endeavor upon catching up with him, despite his protestations.</p>
