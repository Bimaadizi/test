<p>Lover's Whisper was a shadar-kai who was part of a group of servants of the Raven Queen in the shadow-cursed lands of Faer√ªn during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Of Thine Will led He Who Was and Lover's Whisper into the lands rich with darkness and tragedy. The malignant curse that twisted the shadow-cursed lands into the mockery of darkness and evil was too strong even for the Shadowfell's shadar-kai. They witnessed the land's darkness, making Lover's Whisper strangle her own raven , and the Raven Queen ordered their retreat. Despite Of Thine Will's protestations, He Who Was stayed behind to punish those souls who deserved a post-mortem judgement.</p>
