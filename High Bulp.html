<p>High Bulp was a demented Cyricist ghoul inhabiting the upper levels of Undermountain in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , High Bulp could be found wandering around the Temple of Cyric on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. The insane undead was rambling, talking to itself or an unseen apparition while smashing its head against cave walls, screaming curses and hatred towards the goddess of magic, Mystra . Even a mention of the goddess's name sent the undead loon into a fit of frenzy. When the hero of Undermountain named Khelbenite came across the mad creature, they thought of the wet smashing sound of High Bulp's head as reminiscent of the hero's mother picking melons in the markets of Waterdeep . In his demented state, the ghoul thought itself to be a famous and all-powerful man and demanded awe and respect.</p>
