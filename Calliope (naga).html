<p>Calliope was a dark naga who served as chief adviser and a consort of Pristoleph the Purple , the eventual Ransar of Innarlith in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like many people who surrounded Pristoleph the Purple, Calliope was ambitious and power-hungry.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1370 DR , Calliope was serving Pristoleph as a trusted adviser and a lover who supported him in his rise to power via elimination of his adversaries and through complicated plots and schemes. Mandalax the Mighty was Pristoleph's main and fiercest opponent. Both men served as personal wizards of Innarlith's then ransar, Aubrin Ravilis .</p>
<p>By 1373 DR , there were rumors that Calliope spawned a clutch of dark naga children deep in Chondalwood . Her spawn could be found infesting the catacombs of Pristal Towers in Innarlith, where they matured to adulthood. These young nagas notably possessed limbs, actually yuan-ti arms grafted on them by Pristoleph himself.</p>
<p>By 1375 DR , Pristoleph the Purple rose to the status of Ransar with Calliope still at his side.</p>
