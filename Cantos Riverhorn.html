<p>Cantos Riverhorn was a corrupt Gem Guard Dispatcher Officer in the city of Keczulla in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cantos Riverhorn was a relatively new member and the commanding officer of the Gem Guards, a military organization responsible for the security and profitability of Keczulla's gem mines. The Amnian city put trust in the Gem Guard as the industry was the major source of income for the city. Quickly, though, Cantos proved to be unconcerned with rules and laws and, under his guidance, the Gem Guard showed lax attitudes and unbecoming behaviors. At some point before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Cantos Riverhorn's branch of the Gem Guard became thoroughly infiltrated and controlled by the local thieves guild, the King's Tears . A Helmite guard named Captain Raegen Brunegar by chance discovered the corruption. She took the proof to her supervisorâ€”Dispatcher Officer Cantos Riverhorn. In response, he pulled a document signed by a large group of guards that accused Raegen Brunegar of gem theft from the mines. Cantos gave Raegen a choice: join her brothers and sisters in the Gem Guard, despite what her deity demanded, or take the fall for them. Raegen refused and was arrested and sentenced to mine labor alongside orc slaves and criminals. She was given the toughest treatment by the fellow guards as they saw her as nothing but a traitor.</p>
