<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The river started in the lower peaks of the Snowflake Mountains in the east of Amn, within the forest of Shilmista . The headwaters included three sets of waterfalls, as they poured over cliffs to end in a deep forest pool. From this pool the river continued to the west, leaving the forest and growing larger and faster. It became the mighty Amstel River near Trollford , after being joined by the Khalleshyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
