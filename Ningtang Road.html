<p>The Ningtang Road was a road in Ch'ing Tung Province in Shou Lung . It ran from the city of Shou'Kuan westward to the city of Yenching in Ma' Yuan Province .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late Shou Year 2608 (1358 DR) or early Shou Year 2609 (1359 DR) , increasing bandit activity along the Ningtang Road east of Yenching made travel dangerous and expensive. Thus, a local merchants guild hired the chanshi Zarwu Koi to protect their caravans. Exploring the western hills of Ching Tung and posing as a bandit himself, Zarwu found and joined the group, learning they were from Chukei Province and were journeying south to prey on travelers and tourists visiting the Komite in Suijeng . He killed them as they slept and took their heads back to the merchants guild.</p>
