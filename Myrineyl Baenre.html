<p>Myrineyl Baenre was the First Priestess of House Baenre circa 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Myrineyl had been groomed from infancy to rule. However, she developed a sadistic side. She had a strange fascination with surface elves and had always at her side a slave attendant of this race. These attendants, however, rarely survived long and always needed to be replaced.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Myrineyl was equally talented in divine and arcane magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Myrineyl was the firstborn of matron mother Quenthel Baenre . In 1480 DR , she was in her last year in Arach-Tinilith .</p>
<p>In later years, she and Quenthel's sister Sos'Umptu Baenre competed for the title of First Priestess. The appointment of her aunt as matron mother of the restored House Do'Urden probably granted the First Priestess position to Myrineyl.</p>
