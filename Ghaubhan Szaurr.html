<p>Ghaubhan Szaurr was a Zhentarim plant in the Cult of the Dragon during the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was treacherous.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a wand, and wore a dark cloak.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He commanded a force of Zhentilar in the Stonelands , which passed themselves off as members of the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ghaubhan Szaurr was a double agent, a plant of the Zhentarim who worked inside the Cult of the Dragon under Manshoon 's orders without the knowledge of the priestly branch of the Zhentarim. However, he was ultimately ready to serve himself alone. He also taught a number of magelings as apprentices, including Ramath .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Ghaubhan Szaurr had read a book by Asklannan detailing a manner of acquiring spellfire from another who had it.</p>
<p>As of 1357 DR , Ghaubhan Szaurr was already known to Fzoul Chembryl as a man serving Manshoon, and not really a mage in service of the Cult of the Dragon , though he told the latter to Xarlraun during their meeting. He became activated to the hunt for Shandril Shessair late that year, when he was informed by one of the magelings he was training, Ramath , who'd had a vision of a blonde woman wreathed in flames, a dwarf, and others coming their way. Ghaubhan quickly reasoned it was a vision of Shandril, and prepared to capture them.</p>
<p>While preparing, Ghaubhan Szaurr was surprised by Manshoon teleporting to his position in the Stonelands; the head of the Zhentarim recognized that Ghaubhan was about to attempt to seize spellfire. After offering the men in Ghaubhan's retinue a chance to surrender, Manshoon slew them. He then revealed that Ramath was one of Manshoon's spies as well, and slew Ghaubhan.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Ghaubhan Szaurr was under the impression, thanks to Asklannan's book, that those who "joined" with a spellfire wielder, an act strongly implied to be carnal in nature, stood a chance of gaining it themselves.</p>
