<p>Olorn Ridaugaur , titled the War King , was the post– Time of Troubles ruler of Dunspeirrin , a position he held onto past the Spellplague and Second Sundering . Despite his impressive reputation, his wife, War Queen Ovdana Xothcorlar , was considered by some sages to be the one truly in charge of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Olorn was described as a dark-skinned and tall duergar , almost 12 ft (3.7 m) in height.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Olorn wielded the Barakuir Scepter , one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar , though he only had access to its power to function as a magical club.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Olorn was seeking the command words of the Barakuir Scepter so that he might claim the Wyrmskull Throne . Even after the War of the Silver Marches , this goal was seemingly not achieved.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Separated by more than 100 generations, Olorn and his issue were the last scions of Taark Shanat , founder of Shanatar .</p>
<p>Olorn came of age during the Time of Troubles, when his mother served as the avatar of Deep Duerra. By the end of the event, he had ascended the Underthrone.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Olorn claimed to be the son of Deep Duerra and grandson of Laduguer , a claim supported by his unusual appearance and Duerra's actions in the body of Dunspeirrin's Queen Mother during the Time of Troubles.</p>
