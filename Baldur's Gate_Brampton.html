<p>Brampton was a district in south-eastern Baldur's Gate . It was located in the Lower City , on the eastern side of Gray Harbor , south of Eastway .</p>
<p>This region was noteworthy in that passage through it was required to reach the Outer City district of Tumbledown .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The docks of Brampton were lined with many warehouses owned by Baldurian shipping interests.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>To avoid tolls and taxes during the 15 th century DR , many smugglers used a route that began in the district of Rivington , south of the River Chionthar . They moved goods downstream along the river before docking at the quay in Brampton. There, illicit cargo was then combined into legitimate shipments and distributed throughout the city.</p>
<h3>Cult of the Dragon</h3>
<p>Sometime in the mid-1480's, the maniacal moon elf Deniak smuggled a half-dozen hobgoblins into the district and established the headquarters for his Tiamat -worshiping-splinter-cell of the Cult of the Dragon near the docks.</p>
<p>Using a number of stolen ritual-books, along with the inherent arcane power of his wild mage sister Delina , Deniak transformed himself into a red dragon . The ritual caused a massive explosion in Brampton, that was visible from across the city in the Watch Citadel .</p>
