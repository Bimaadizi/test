<p>The Sweetwater Traders , or simply Sweetwater , were a shipping and transport company operating in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . The company was owned by Mathias Rylin . They were named for the minty-sweet waters of the Delimbiyr River .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sweetwater focused its efforts on transporting goods and produce along the Delimbiyr Vale, between the four major settlements of Daggerford , Secomber , Loudwater , and Llorkh , with occasional forays to Waterdeep . While dealing in Llorkh meant dealing with the Zhentarim , they were not known to ever carry contraband, drugs , poisons , or slaves . They had a reputation for reliability.</p>
<h2>Symbol</h2>
<p>Their symbol was a waterfall in profile—most likely the Shining Falls —from which four motes of light rose. This was ringed by a circle formed from the names of their principle stops: Daggerford, Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh. These symbols were displayed in gold paint on the sides of the wagons in their caravans.</p>
