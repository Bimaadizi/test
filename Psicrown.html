<p>Psicrowns were psionically charged headbands that granted their wearers several psionic powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The average psicrown was large enough to fit the heads of demihumans , humans , and similarly sized creatures. Their designs varied, with some resembling an actual heavily adorned crown or circlet , whilst others were simple headbands with a crystal centerpiece, but regardless of shape they always weighed less than 1 pound (0.45 kilograms). They could be constructed of potentially any material, including psionically reinforced silk , but most were composed of metals. The adornments on any given psicrown could be reflective of their epithet and suite of powers, such as the psicrown of the beast , which was adorned with a collection of bear claws and snake fangs.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Psicrowns was activated in a method similar to dorjes , requiring special knowledge of a power manifestation and the formation of a proper command thought. This meant a wearer could not use powers that were unavailable to their path of psionics, such as a wilder trying to use a psychic warrior power.</p>
<p>When activating a psicrown , mental energy stored within it was used to fuel any one of its powers, rather than drawing upon the manifester's own internal store of mental energy. Unlike with other psionic items, a wearer could draw upon their own mental acuity for a power if it was greater than the psicrown's own degree of psionic strength, making these items more potent in the hands of powerful manifesters. Additionally, powers manifested by a psicrown were harder to dispel and had better odds of overcoming psychic resistances.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>Unlike dorjes , psicrowns came in wholly distinct types with specific bundles of powers, distinguished by an epithet, and thus likewise varied in market value. For example, a psicrown of the beast stored the powers claw of energy , duodimensional claw , prevenom , psionic lion's charge , and truevenom .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Crafting a psicrown required appropriate materials, such as a crown or circlet, and knowing the powers to be imprinted upon it or have some alternative form of access to those powers.</p>
