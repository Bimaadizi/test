<p>Torath's March was a trail that ran inland from the city of Phlan into the lands north of the Moonsea .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The trail started at a point not far from the city, where the Phlan Path to Melvaunt turned east after running alongside the Quivering Forest to avoid the Twilight Marsh . It skirted along the northeastern edges of the forest and turned northwards when it reached the eastern edge of the Dragonspine Mountains , continuing on until it reached Castle Vathar .</p>
<p>At Castle Vathar, Torath's March connected with the Ilinvur Trail that continued north to Ilinvur , and the Verdigris Trail that ran southwards to the community of Verdigris .</p>
