<p>The Immerflow was one of four major rivers in Cormyr that fed the Wyvernwater .</p>
<p>The large volume of water falling in the Thunder Peaks was the reason for the river's existence, and the river formed in the Twin Peaks of Urlspur , near the Falls of Tumbling Stars . A large herd of hippogriffs was thought to live near the source.</p>
<p>Noktil was one of the few notable settlements along this river, and the tiny village had several waterwheels along the river's banks.</p>
