<p>Gelroos Hun'ett , also known as the Faceless One , was a drow wizard and one of the masters at Sorcere in the drow city of Menzoberranzan in the late 12 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When wandering the city, Faceless dressed in a dark cloak to hide his grotesque ruined face. His once elven features were reduced to a mask of blank white and green goo.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was extremely impatient and somewhat reckless.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was an accomplished master in Sorcere. He specialized in creating new spells and combining magical effects to enhance their power. Many of the spells taught at Sorcere were the result of his work. He was horribly disfigured after one of his magical combinations backfired and melted the flesh from his face.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Black Hound, 1296 DR , Gelroos secretly met with Malice Do'Urden , a meeting arranged by Jarlaxle of Bregan D'aerthe at the command of Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre , in a room deep beneath Sorcere . Gelroos gives Malice a scroll tube containing a powerful spell of “birth magic” in hopes of gaining a healing salve from Malice. He was forbidden from even looking at the scroll by his priestess associates at Arach-Tinilith . Although it is later revealed that he made a copy of the scroll himself. He instructed Malice that secrecy was demanded regarding the use of the scroll and that the Ruling Council would be paying attention. The magic contained in the scroll was that which was to provide the destructive power necessary for House Do'Urden to overthrow and destroy House De Vir .</p>
<p>While attempting to eradicate Alton De Vir , Gelroos was slain by his brother and student Masoj Hun'ett with a crossbow .</p>
