<p>The Kingdom of Mertwig was a small monarchy nestled within a valley in the Vast , named for its most famous ruler.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This kingdom was located near the River Vesper , between the cities of Hlintar and Kurth . The valley it was situated in hosted a number of forests and swamps, hills and mountains, rivers, and even a bit of desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The kingdom's central settlement was a walled-in town, with gates to the east, west, and south, as well as a port. Its buildings had an eclectic mixture of architectural styles, including some reminescent of distant lands like Calimshan or Zakhara . This was most evident in it having an area referred to as "The Kasbah ", which was a word in the Midani language that meant "stronghold" or "castle". Most of the upper class lived in hilltop homes close to the central palace, whilst the lower class were relegated to slums.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The valley where the Kingdom of Mertwig stood was once home to a mighty ancient civilization, referred to by locals simply as the "Old Ones", for the kingdom lacked any archeologists to due serious research into who they were. They left behind such ruins as the Toppled Temple and Last Pyramid in the Sand . They were proceeded by a warrior culture called the Rhygn , who fought in a bloody war with the father of the would-be king Mertwig . The war lasted for two days and a single night, ending in the death of all the Rhygn people. Following this conflict, the Rhygn people were buried within two great mounds .</p>
<p>For a time the kingdom seemed poised to become a power in the Vast. However, this came to an end once the trade route that spanned from the Kurth to Hlintar, the Cross Road , was rerouted away from Mertwig in order to become a more direct path.</p>
<p>Sometime in the early 14 th century DR , the eponymous King Mertwig fathered twin heirs during a time of war, a boy and a girl . From the aristocratic to the poor, the citizens of the kingdom came to the palace to bestow gifts upon them. Then one day, caught unaware, at six months of age they were allegedly kidnapped by a band of angry gypsies .</p>
<p>Over the course of the next two decades, the Grand Wizir Samot worked to replace the kingdom's ministers with people loyal to him. At the age of 65, King Mertwig was on his deathbed. Ever hopeful that his children might return to him, the king sent out a decree, proclaiming that whosoever manages to traverse his treacherous maze and display both a royal treasure and the royal birthmark would be crowned the new ruler of the kingdom.</p>
<p>There were seven royal treasures in total, scattered throughout the kingdom, and admittance to the Royal Palace's maze required showing one of these to the guards. These included an emerald , a gold crown , a gold chalice , a gold locket that had been broken in two, an invisible ring , and an onyx figurine of an ox .</p>
<p>With this proclamation came all manner of fortune hunters flocking to the Kingdom of Mertwig, with hirelings in tow, eager to plunder its riches. All the while, Samot was plotting to enact his coup should no suitable "heir" make it to the throne before Mertwig's death. Among the known adventurers to attempt to claim the throne were Arnie Schwartz , Benjamin Blue , Bob Bonker , Drumwell Weiss , Gennie Gron , Gertrud Green , Ralph the Red , Roscoe Rapid , and Wilford White . Those who took up this quest encountered all manner of strange and fantastical hazards along the way, from griffons and dragons , to the more peculiar bandersnatch , Blatant Beast , and ghost of Great Caesar . Some would even claim to have had an encounter with the archdevil Asmodeus .</p>
