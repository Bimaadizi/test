<p>Cimbar was a city-state in the Old Empires and a sometimes-capital of the empire of Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Cimbar was a port city on the eastern side of the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cimbar was known as a city of philosophy and art. Even its slaves were literate, and it required participation in the arts from its citizens. It had colleges for both sages and artists.</p>
<p>The streets of Cimbar were beautiful and clean. It was divided into two halves, Old Cimbar and New Cimbar. Old Cimbar contained the Palace of the Sceptanar and the University . New Cimbar had the largest port in the region and many homes and shops, as well as theaters, a hippodrome, and an arena.</p>
<p>By 1359, the city contained both a Temple of Tempus and a small temple of the Red Knight .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Cimbar was ruled by a leader called a Sceptanar , who was usually a wizard . The ruler had absolute authority but was advised by a senate, which was elected by land-owning males.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Cimbar's navy was second in size only to the navy of Thay when compared to other fleets of the Inner Sea.</p>
<p>The armed forces of Cimbar numbered 15,000 persons total in 1357 DR . Of these, 100 were mounted air cavalry, riding griffons ; 100 were artillery mages ; 1,300 were marines; 9,000 were infantry; and 2,500 were regular cavalry.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Old Cimbar was founded as a port by the people of Unther 500 years before the founding of Cormyr .</p>
<p>In 902 DR , when the red dragon Tchazzar , in human disguise, united the city-states of Chessenta, he made Cimbar his capital. According to legends, the mythical hero Cevalias , the Champion of Cimbar, was instrumental in making Cimbar its capital after falling in love with Cimbar's ruler's daughter, Saphia , who quickly learned to manipulate her paramour. With her father's guidance, Saphia made Cevalias into a deadly weapon of destruction that took lives of over a thousand warriors of other Chessentan cities.</p>
<p>In 1154 DR , Cimbar was put to siege by the city-states of Akanax and Soorenar .</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , riots and panic broke out in the city. Nicos Nathos came out of retirement to help deal with these events but died from the exertion. He was named a War Hero of Chessenta for his actions.</p>
<p>In the late half of the 14 th century DR , the shadow adept Aeron Morieth deposed the previous Sceptanar and ruled the city for several months. After this short time, he appointed a woman named Melisanda from Arrabar to succeed him.</p>
<p>Tchazzar returned in 1373 DR , now in the form of a dragon, and took control of the city once again.</p>
