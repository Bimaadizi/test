<p>A ring ward was a type of magical protection used in the kingdom of Cormyr . It was the weakest of three standard types of wards employed by the king. Like each of the three standard wards, the actual spell to prepare the ward was a carefully guarded state secret, though it was similar to the spell known as wardmist .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ring ward would apply a weak electrical shock to any person not bearing a Purple Dragon ring . The shock was strong enough to turn away various animals as well. In addition, any such unauthorized creature would trigger a light or sound alarm.</p>
<p>The ward also inhibited the casting of weaker spells in the vicinity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The palace in the city of Arabel had several floors protected by ring wards , as did the gates of Oldstone Hall in Wheloon .</p>
