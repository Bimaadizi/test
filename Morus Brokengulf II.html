<p>Morus Brokengulf II was a paladin of the Knights of Samular in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Morus II was, from the age of 16, a devoted paladin and Tyrran zealot, even cutting off his right hand in sacrifice to Tyr and soon joining the Knights of Samular.</p>
<p>After a long time hunting evil throughout the Sword Coast , the death of Lord Morus Brokengulf I forced Morus II to become the next patriarch of the Brokengulf family. However, after some months of work, Morus II was greatly frustrated and turned over day-to-day operations of the family business to fellow Knight Gareth Cormaeril , and again set out to fight evil.</p>
<p>Morus II sometimes returned to the city but spent most of his time fighting monsters and hunting Claugiyliamatar , the old enemy of his family.</p>
