<p>The Crossing Inn was an inn on the Phlan Path , the road that stretched between the town of Phlan , and the city of Melvaunt . It was named for its proximity to the Trank River Bridge, which crossed the Trank River where the waterway met the Phlan Path.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The inn was located on the east side of the Trank River, just south of the Phlan Path.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Inn was a single-story octagonal building whose roof was faceted along all eight of the building's walls, tapering high above until it met a central stone chimney. A small dock on the east bank of the river allowed keelboats to moor up close by the inn.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Inside was a large common room. Several tables were available for dining, and one particularly large table was used for meetings. There were no beds, but there was easily enough space on the floor for 50 people to sleep.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Short perimeter walls surrounding the main structure provided some defense. Romsan , the inn's proprietor and a capable former adventurer, was capable of defending his business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Crossing Inn was a popular place for travellers to stay in the late 15th century DR. It was a place where people could come and learn the latest news from all along the northern shore of the Moonsea . In 1489 DR , Romsan sent a call out to adventurers to help him save more than forty people who had been abducted over the past week. The following winter, after Phlan fell to The Maimed Virulence , The Inn's reputation as a rumor hub became important to those trying to retake Phlan as those who frequented the place belived that something worse was coming.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Romsan Kal was a former adventurer who ran the inn as its proprietor. He had a small staff working under him.</p>
