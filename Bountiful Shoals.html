<p>The Bountiful Shoals was a large coral reef found in the Golden Gulf offshore from the northern Pearl Cities of west Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The reef stretched parallel to the shore in a diagonal pattern for roughly 135 miles (217 kilometers), separating Maribar Island from the Pearl Cities and the city of Sikak specifically. The Bountiful Shoals, combined with other rocky shoals and hidden sand banks, made the channel between Maribar Island and the mainland a treacherous passage for ships.</p>
