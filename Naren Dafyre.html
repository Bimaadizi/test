<p>Naren Dafyre was a merchant residing in Skullport in the late 15th century DR. He was a lesser lord of the Mandible gang, a position he believed was too low for him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of Naren's ancestors was the original owner of the Dragon's Tooth sword, the sword that The Mandible's leader held as a badge of office. Years prior to 1479 DR the sword compelled Naren to leave Waterdeep and journey to Skullport where he lived ever since. He clawed his way up the Mandible's hierarchy in an attempt to reclaim his ancestral sword.</p>
