<p>Plumachs were the least powerful of all the rilmani subspecies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Plumachs were short humanoids with stocky builds and dull, gray metallic skin. Their shoulders were broad, their legs heavy, and their hands were wide and stubby. Like all rilmani, their eyes emitted a pearly light.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Plumachs were staunch isolationists above all else, going to great lengths to mind their own business. When engaged in combat they could be very stubborn and tenacious. They typically had a great deal of common sense and practical wisdom.</p>
<p>Plumachs highly valued hard work and showed respect where it was due.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Though they were the weakest of rilmani, they possessed a decent natural strength and had dense hides that could only be harmed by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment . In addition, they possessed a few innate spell -like abilities, which they could use one at a time. These included chill touch , detect alignment , heat metal , and hold person . Once per day they could create a fog cloud .</p>
<p>In addition, plumachs could cast the standard rilmani arsenal of spells: darkness , dismissal , continual light , hold monster , and teleport without error . They always had the spell know alignment active.</p>
<p>Like all rilmani, they could freely travel to the Astral plane or any of the Outer Planes , but their access to the Prime Material plane was restricted. They were only capable of traveling there if a creature of law or chaos of equal power was already present.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lacking the grace and strength of their more powerful rilmani-kin, plumachs would only resort to combat whenever it was clear that their lives or interests were threatened. They typically fought with clubs , heavy maces , and mauls made of lead.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>In rilmani society, plumachs made up the common citizenry of the Outlands . They carried out day-to-day business in such roles as craftsmen, merchants, and teamsters.</p>
<p>Plumachs devoted a great deal of their time to creating either works of art or devices of comfort and convenience. Beyond their role as common citizenry, plumachs were involved in keeping an eye on the balance of things in the Outlands , which made plumach emissaries and traders common throughout that plane . In times of great need they were rallied by aurumachs to defend the Balance .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some plumachs were known to act as servants of the deities Vergadain and Waukeen .</p>
