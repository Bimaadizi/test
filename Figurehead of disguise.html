<p>A figurehead of disguise was a wooden statue affixed upon a spelljammer that granted magical illusory powers to the mage at the helm .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These statues were made from cherry wood and adorned with a large onyx . Unlike other spelljamming figureheads, which were carved in humanoid form, these took the shape of couatl . The wings of the statue would wrap around each side of the ship and the tail would dip beneath its prow. Each figurehead granted their ship a unique illusion .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When activated by the mage at the spelljammer's helm, figureheads of illusion could, once per day, create an illusory effect, altering the appearance of the ship. These images could be additional weaponry, larger and more numerous sails and armor or other such deceptive appearances. These illusions were non-functioning, but could be eliminated by contact, the spelljamming mage losing concentration, or upon being dispelled.</p>
