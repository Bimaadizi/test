<p>The Pesarkhals were the post powerful crime family in Calimshan in 1370 DR , controlling each of the remaining three houses, because Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal sat on the throne.</p>
<p>Ralan el Pesarkhal also intentionally married off his daughters to the other families to control them, and while the seat of control for el Pesarkhal was technically in Calimport , there was at least one Pesarkhal family member in a position of power in every city throughout Calimshan.</p>
