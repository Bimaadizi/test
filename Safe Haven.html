<p>The Safe Haven was the inn of Darkenshield , a Cormyrean village in the Stonelands . It was destroyed along with the rest of the village in 1352 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was originally two stories, though by 1369 DR the upper floor had collapsed in on itself. The nearby barn also remained mostly intact, though both structures were barely habitable. The internal walls of the inn were also largely destroyed, as the resident ogres desired more open living space.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR , Darkenshield was attacked by one of Gondegal 's units, the Twilight Brigade . The Safe Haven was not spared, and during the raid the twelve-year-old stableboy died trying to protect the horses stabled in the barn.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR, the ruins were inhabited by a gang of eight ogres who found it a convenient camping spot. They redecorated the interior and defended the area from invaders, killing and eating one of Lord Vorik Aris 's agents when he attempted to scout out the ruins. They had amassed a small hoard of treasure in their time, including thousands of coins, a ring of water elemental command , a Murlynd's spoon , a periapt of health , and a Quaal's feather token .</p>
