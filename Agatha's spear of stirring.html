<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1374 DR , the spear of stirring was wielded by Agatha the Cook, the aptly named cook of the nomadic frost giant Bloodaxe . The giants ventured too close to the town of Voonlar during the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis and hunted out of a cave not far from Shind Road , feeding on travelers and Zhentarim troops. Agatha had her hands full with all the cooking and used the spear's magic to instantly bring her stew cauldrons to the boiling point.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Bloodaxes were bribed by Cheswick Goldwaters , a greater doppelganger agent of the unseen , to abduct the wife of the man it impersonated, a Sembian noblewoman Amberlyn Goldwaters . The Unseen wanted the Hero of Daggerford to die rescuing the woman, but instead the hero and the companions slew the man-eating frost giants, picking up Agatha's spear of stirring from the evil cook's dead hands.</p>
