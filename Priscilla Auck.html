<p>Priscilla Auck was the sister of Feringal , lord of Auckney , in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Priscilla was domineering and controlling over her younger brother's actions, in part because of her desire to rule Auckney herself. She tended a beautiful garden in Castle Auck, perhaps the only fact that endeared her to Meralda Ganderlay , Feringal's betrothed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Priscilla was the older sister of Feringal, whom she called "Feri." Their father was Tristan Auck , who died when Priscilla was about 10 years old.</p>
<p>She looked down and even despised Meralda, Feringal's betrothed, until she was led to believe that Meralda had been raped. She would later suspect that Meralda's child was actually Jaka Sculi 's, not Wulfgar 's, conceived out of wedlock, and tried to convince her brother that his wife had betrayed him. Even after Wulfgar covered for Meralda by claiming the baby Colson , Priscilla would continue to make verbals jabs towards her sister-in-law, until Meralda threatened to convince Feringal to strip his sister of her noble status and send her to live among the peasants.</p>
<p>She and Temigast were secretly lovers.</p>
