<p>The Dark Robes were a secret guild of necromancers based in Baldur's Gate around 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Formed because their deeds were illegal by Baldurian law, the Dark Robes gathered at nights in the catacombs under the city. They'd renovated some of the subterranean crypts into laboratories in which they experimented with the undead .</p>
<p>They wore dark robes with deep hoods and went by code names to conceal their true identities even from each other. However, each was a respectable citizen during the day.</p>
