<p>The Dancer's Blushing Mask was a popular festhall located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Part of the festhall was located underground.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though quiet by day, the Dancer's Blushing Mask was a roaring spot and local favorite at night. The festhall was expensive with a twelve gold piece entry fee, though an annual membership could be had for thirty gold and included a personal wardrobe closet.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The festhall was staffed by comely women who wore masks to conceal their identities. One amorous patron once torn the mask off of a waitress only to discover a second mask was painted on her skin. Patrons of the Mask were encouraged to dress up and masquerade as someone else within the festhall. This was accomplished with simple costumes, or wizards were permitted to charge fees for casting convincing illusions .</p>
<p>The festhall was owned by Illythe Haudamar .</p>
