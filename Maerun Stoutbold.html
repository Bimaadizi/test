<p>Maerun Stoutbold was a merchant in Suzail , Cormyr around 1367 DR . He ran a shipbuilding company out of both Suzail and Marsember that dealt in the repair and sale of ships, nets, and masts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He had not been found to have broken the law but he was well known to be the person to speak to for silent passage on a ship. Although Maerun was caught by a War Wizard with two bound females, he hired a Sembian mage to claim they were creatures polymorphed into human form for safe transportation. Maerun spent his winters in Marsember.</p>
