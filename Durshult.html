<p>Durshult the Mage , also known as Durshult the Doomweaver , was a mage who was active several centuries before the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<p>An infamous "spellslinger", Durshult made a living by challenging other mages to spell battles and, when victorious, stealing all their magic .</p>
<p>At last, however, Durshult lost a duel to another mage, reported to be either the sorceress Haleera Shundyl in a sorcerous duel fought in Baldur's Gate , or the Archwizard of the Castle in the Clouds, Rarimmon Tlarn . The victor then polymorphed Durshult into the humiliating form of a wingless wonder . For some decades after, it became a fad among mages to trap their defeated foes in wonder form.</p>
