<p>The Temper pond was a brisk, clear pond found in Tegal's Mark , the capital of Tasseldale . This body of water served as both a swimming hole for the Tassadran and a cooling pond for the weaponsmiths of Tegal Swordsmiths .</p>
<p>It was rumored that the pond was also the location where the infamous bandit Buren the Black Mask hid the cache of gems he had stolen from Sembian noblewomen over the years.</p>
