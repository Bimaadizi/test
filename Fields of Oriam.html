<p>The Fields of Oriam were plains south of the Bay of Chessenta in Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>They formed a savannah of rolling grassland with long grasses and occasional pine barrens, but the soil was poor, being too dry and acidic for farmland.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Hardly any human settlements were to be found here, partly because of the limited agriculture but mostly because the area is home to cockatrices .</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>Ancient Untheric ruins dotted the savannah. The most notable among these is the so-called Lost Temple of Ptah , which was said to still hold holy tablets of magnificent power and wisdom.</p>
