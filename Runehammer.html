<p>A runehammer was a rare, magical +1 warhammer .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Runehammers were typically constructed of darksteel . A large rune was marked on their head, indicating the spell it carried and giving the item its name.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Runehammers had the ability to cast a single spell once per day, but the spell was the same each time, stored in the hammer. There were three common types:</p>
<p>Some sources claimed that these spells could be cast at least six times per day. Each time a runehammer's power was used there was a very small chance of Moradin willing it to vanish to another plane, potentially taking along whoever was currently wielding it.</p>
<p>Due to being made of darksteel, all were known to impart a little electricity upon impact.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Forging a runehammer required the spell that was stored in the weapon.</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of spell stored, the hammer could be worth between 11,000 and 18,000 gold pieces.</p>
