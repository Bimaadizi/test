<p>A skiff was a small open boat.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skiffs were used extensively in Marsember , Cormyr for personal transportation. These skiffs were usually made from wood and sealed with tar or fish oil . They were flat-bottomed and around 10 ft (3 m) in length, with identical upturned ends so that the direction of travel was reversible. They could be rigged with sails if necessary, but were often pole-driven by their occupants.</p>
