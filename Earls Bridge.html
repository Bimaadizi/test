<p>Earls Bridge was one of the two drawbridges that crossed the Clear Whirl River to Castle Hartwick .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Earls Bridge was the eastern drawbridge to Castle Hartwick. The bridge rested on two flying buttresses. It was not strong enough to carry more than a single full-sized giant at a time.</p>
<p>A small watchhouse carved into the stone of the cliff at the river's edge contained three halberd -bearing sentries. Two giants from the Giant Guard also manned the bridge.</p>
