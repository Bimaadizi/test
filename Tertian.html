<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tertians were very tall humanoids, with a height of 12 ft (3.7 m). They had a prehensile tail that acted as a third arm, at the tip of which was a growth that was similar to a mace . A tertian had a ring of horns that encircled their hairless head. They appeared muscular and carved as if from a dark onyx .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>If forced into combat, a tertian will use a combination of innate abilities, spells, tail and fists.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all hierarch modrons, tertians had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of clairaudience , clairvoyance , command , dimension door , teleport without error , and wall of force spells at will. Tertians were able to cast arcane spells as well as divine spells from the Law , Protection and War domains. Tertians were immune to all effects that influenced the mind, all psionic-based attacks and had a resistance to acid, cold and fire.</p>

<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Tertians were able to communicate telepathically with any sentient creature within 405 mi (652 km) and could see in darkvision up to 60 ft (18 m).</p>
