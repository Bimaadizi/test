<p>Graul was an orc leader in Dead Orc Pass in the Silver Marches .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Graul was a large orc.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Graul was a follower of Gruumsh , but he was not very religious. Nevertheless, he was very crafty and knew how to use his people's superstitions against them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He raided caravans that came through the Dead Orc Pass, but the blind ranger Montolio Debrouchee often stood in his way. His tribe's shaman was superstitious of Montolio, calling him an omen of bad magic In 1341 DR , Graul had under his command 1,000 fighters (including orcs, worgs , and giants ) and controlled half of the valley. That year, he became aware of the presence of the drow Drizzt Do'Urden . Unsure of whether he was a scout or a renegade, he ordered his minions to keep their distance from the drow. But as Drizzt remained in the valley throughout the winter, Graul, fearing a potential rival seeking to usurp his throne, sent two patrols to kill him but they were unsuccessful due to Montolio's interference.</p>
<p>Graul remained unaware of Drizzt's exact whereabouts until he was approached by the bounty hunter Roddy Mc Gristle , who convinced him (through monetary payment) to mount an attack against Montolio's home in Mooshie's Grove . Having probable cause to attack the grove as retaliation for Montolio's aiding of the drow, Graul begun his siege during the new moon with the shaman's blessing from Gruumsh One-eye . The attack failed, and Graul and the survivors turned on Mc Gristle; he easily escaped, however.</p>
