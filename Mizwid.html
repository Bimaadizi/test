<p>Bagpipes were a type of wind instrument that used a bag filled with the help of a mouthpiece to provide the necessary flow, while the sound came from the attached reed or reeds with different holes to vary the tone. Dwarves held bagpipes in high regard.</p>
<h2>Mizwid</h2>
<p>The Zakharan version of the bagpipes was called mizwid (meaning "food pouch" in Midani ). It was played with a double-reeded flute attached to the wind bag with corresponding two rows of holes where the melody could be played, while it produced an underlying droning tone at the same time.</p>
