<p>The Lurker in the Middle was a demon bound by the ancient Nar . It guarded one of the main underground passages towards the city of Dun-Tharos , and it was powerful enough to give even the Rotting Man 's right hand pause while exploring the subterranean ruins.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>From a distance, the Lurker itself was visible only as a pulsing, ravenous glow.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Lurker in the Middle lurked in the middle of a hallway. Though it appeared to be hungry, it did not attack people who did not approach it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373Â DR , the location and power of the Lurker were known to both the Rotting Man and the Nentyarch . The former took the monster into consideration when commanding the traitor Nentyar hunter Fallon to make his path to Dun-Tharos through the underground so as to lose his pursuers; the Talontyr sent the blightlord Damanda to meet him, to ensure he did not run into the Lurker.</p>
<p>Fallon spotted the Lurker while on the way to meet her, choosing to take a detour so as to not approach it. His decision seemed to briefly upset the fiend. Upon her arrival, Damanda suspected that the elf, Fallon, could have been eaten by the Lurker in the Middle; however, by its glow, she judged it had not eaten recently.</p>
