<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Drow Spinnan Trisagion was brought to the ruined city of Myth Drannor by drow inquisitors of House Freth . The drow house forged an alliance with the Cult of the Dragon that lorded over the ruins and were granted control of the deep Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor . The inquisitors created a small shrine to Lolth and placed Drow Spinnan Trisagion inside a sacrificial spider totem. The shrine was defended by a smattering of House Freth warriors, a High Priest, an inquisitor, and two trained arraccats . Any group of adventurers strong enough to defeat the drow party and inquisitive enough to open the totem was sure to be rewarded with the powerful clerical tome.</p>
