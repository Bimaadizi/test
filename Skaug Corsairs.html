<p>The Skaug Corsairs were a group of pirates who protected the port of Skaug on the island of Skaug in the Sea of Swords . The Corsair's fleet comprised fifteen ships in 1370 DR and they had their own private docks at the port.</p>
<p>The crew was well paid and well equipped as they made money not only by raiding coastal navies and competitor crews, but also through the dock fees of visiting ships at the port. Members received good pay to prevent their betrayal.</p>
