<p>A rogue stone (sometimes written roguestone ) was a small, extremely rare magical gemstone with a tendency to cause wild magic .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Varied in overall outer hue but always chatoyant, rogue stones were filled with rainbow colors that flowed as if in liquid, slowly swirling iridescently, when exposed to sunlight. They did in fact contain oil, on which iridescent particles were suspended, always in movement. Rogue stones were easily faceted along natural planes and the resulting faces gave the stones their iridescent property.</p>
<p>One rogue stone, belonging to Elminster , was large and blue. Another stone, known to have been in Elminster's possession at some point, was instead a dime-sized, or 0.71 inches (18 millimeters), faceted, and displaying shifting colors. Another stone, once in possession of Shandril Shessair , was teardrop-shaped, smooth, sparkling and iridescent, with swirling colors within. One last stone, enspelled by the mage Kordeerlar , resembled a chatoyant ruby. Another rogue stone, possessed by Dove Falconhand , was green.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>On the inside, rogue stones contained cavities filled with an oily mineral on which partially iridescent particles were suspended. These free-floating particles were responsible for the flowing colors within the rogue stones. Though their exact origin was unknown, they were formed in much the same way as other gemstones.</p>
<p>A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp but was likely to be worth much more to wizards who knew of its uses. There were more than sixty known rogue stones throughout the Realms.</p>
<p>Single stones have been found in treasure hoards, cold regions, and sunk in swamps, but evidence about what type of rock they occurred in was inconclusive. They were extremely rare and seemed to repel each other: no two rogue stones were ever found in the same place at the same time.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Rogue stones were used to cast the gemjump spell. Rogue stones did not have a detectable magic aura, except at the time the gemjump spell was being cast, and they were not destroyed or consumed by the initial enchantment or the activation of the spell.</p>
<p>The presence of a rogue stone within 20 ft (6.1 m) of a spell effect (either near the caster or the target, if any) increased the chances of that magic going wild or failing. At the recipient end, it decreased the chances of the target resisting or overcoming the magic effect, if applicable. If a rogue stone was used in the construction of a wand that produced a chaotic or teleportation effect, it increased the efficacy of that effect by either making it more difficult to resist or by increasing the level at which the effect was cast.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rogue stones and gemjumping have played a role in several dramatic events in the history of the Realms.</p>
<p>At some point, the wizard Elminster gave a rogue stone to the Simbul which had the power to summon him.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some primitive humans believed rogue stones to be sentient and contained the conscious part of dragons or fabled heroes. Most sages agreed this view was strictly folklore.</p>
