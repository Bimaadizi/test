<p>Wander was a stray dog turned a guard dog for the Morden Winery outside the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wander, and its fellow stray mutt Merlot found their way to the Morden Winery sometime before the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR . The dogs were fed and taken care of by the winery's inhabitants, the medusa Samanthiss and her maedar mate Vorlon . Eventually, the strays became loyal guard dogs for the couple and could often be found patrolling the winery, along with other creatures that defended it. Their keen sense of smell allowed for early intruder detection, and loud barking alerted the maedar and the medusa.</p>
