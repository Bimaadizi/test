<p>Durbem was a dwarf artisan of the Goblinbreaker Clan who resided in Baldur's Gate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Borador Goldhand and Durbem both were clan-brothers from the Goblinbreakers, the clan that got into a large debt with some elves , though it was not known who exactly or why. During his time in Baldur's Gate in the late 14 th century DR, the same time as Borador took on an adventuring career to help their clan pay off the debt, Durbem offered his artisanal weapons and armor smithing for hire. One of his business partners was merchant Bartley , who operated in the Upper City and the Lower City of the Gate.</p>
<p>He could often be seen slurping ale at the Purple Wyrm Inn and Tavern of the Upper City. His grumpy attitude could easily be fixed by buying him a drink and making a crude joke. He also came to possess a key to a treasure vault within the famed Halls of the Hammer , an abandoned dwarf hold in the High Moor , which he was happy to sell to a capable adventurer with whom he shared a tankard or ten. Durbem also collected an impressive amount of gold from Borador Goldhand to pay for the clan and, eventually, led his clan-brother to retake Gandam's Hold and its mine to aid further with the debt. Eventually, Durbem helped Borador Goldhand reach the status of the dwarven hero .</p>
