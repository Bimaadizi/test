<p>Mask of relentless compassion was an enchanted masked cowl that boosted the wearer's healing magic in exchange for draining their damage-dealing potential, created sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These cloth masks boosted the wearer's wisdom and doubled their healing magic's potency, in exchange for taking away all of their offensive capabilities. It also was a cursed item, rendering the wearer unable to deal more than a harmless scratch worth of damage, compelled to perform good deeds, and unable to peel the mask off their face.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These cursed items were originally designed to be worn by individuals looking to conceal their true intentions behind a mask of benevolence and righteousness. Some thought that the curse that compelled the wearer to do good deeds was added to the item as a way to punish someone.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the mask was sold to Perren a malicious drow from the area of Underdark under the Savage Frontier in northwest Faerûn . Cursed with being good and unable to attacks anyone nor anything, Perren resorted to begging for help. The Champion of the Burning Dawn and their allies traveled to Strumoru's Oddities in the Darklake district of Gracklstugh in order to track down the item's seller. Subsequently, the Champion helped Perren to break the mask's curse , freeing the drow from the tyranny of good. As a reward, the heroes received the mask of relentless compassion , now freely usable without the danger of being cursed.</p>
