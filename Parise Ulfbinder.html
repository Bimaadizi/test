<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Parise Ulfbinder was friends with Draygo Quick , another Netherese noble. Like Draygo Quick, had an intense interest in the Chosen of the gods . Parise suspected that Ruqiah / Catti-brie was the Chosen of Mielikki ; he even sent out two Shadovar agents, Untaris and Alpirs De'Noutess , to kidnap her, although they failed. For a time Parise wondered if Drizzt Do'Urden was the Chosen of Lolth , although he later rescinded that idea in favor of Dahlia Sin'felle being favored of Lolth.</p>
<p>Parise was also acquainted with Lady Avelyere , with whom he watched the re-acquaintance of the Companions of the Hall on Kelvin's Cairn on 19 Ches 1484 DR .</p>
