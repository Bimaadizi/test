<p>The Scamp Warrens was a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Telos City , the capital of Vaasa in the 15 th century DR . It was home to members of smaller races, who were oppressed, scorned, and derogatorily called "scamps" by the ruling Warlock Knights .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Scamp Warrens were home primarily to halflings , goblins , and kobolds . It had a reputation for its criminal element as it was the main source of contraband goods in Telos and the Warlock Knights did not police the area.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Members of smaller races were usually enslaved by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa in the late 15 th century DR, and even free halflings, goblins, and kobolds were seen as lesser than serfs of larger races, such as humans , dwarves , half-orcs , or even orcs . This led to the members of these diminutive groups banding together on the eastern outskirts of Telos and making a home for themselves where they ruled the streets.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Scamp Warrens contained a black market where goods outlawed by the Warlock Knights could be found. Most notably, weapons and armor made of ironfell could be bought and sold here.</p>
