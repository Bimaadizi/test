<p>She was born in the jungles of Chult, as thus was well acquainted with its dangers. While working as a guide in Port Nyanzaru, she would go to great lengths to conceal her lycanthropy from her clients.</p>
<p>At some point, her mask of the beast was stolen by the pterafolk of Firefinger . Eager to retrieve it, Azaka offered to waive her fee for any group of adventurers who would help her get it back.</p>
<p>During the events of the death curse , she took on a job at the behest of Mother Sibonseni to lead a group of champions from Daggerford into the jungle as they investigated the cause and source of the curse. She led this group first along the River Soshenstar through Camp Righteous to Camp Vengeance , where they assisted the beleaguered Order of the Gauntlet , and from there they traveled through the Aldani Basin to Kir Sabal . After helping to defend the aarakocra of Kir Sabal, this group learned the location of the lost city of Omu , and upon travelling there, they learned from Orvex Ocrammas about the Tomb of the Nine Gods . Seeking to gain entrance to the Tomb brought them into conflict with the yuan-ti led by Ras Nsi , and Azaka was ultimately captured by the yuan-ti, used as bait to draw out her clients, and then killed. Because of the death curse, her soul was siphoned away by the Soulmonger , thus preventing her from being raised from the dead . However, following the destruction of the Soulmonger , she was successfully brought back by the Selûnite cleric Celeste .</p>
