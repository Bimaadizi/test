<p>The Scimitar of Souls was a unique sword wielded by the god Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was a black-bladed scimitar , massive in size.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This magical scimitar +3 was aligned lawful evil . It could cut through any magical barrier known, such as a wall of force or a prismatic sphere with no injury to the wielder. Moreover, a hit from it could drain life from living creatures and destroy outright undead that were not divine in nature.</p>
<p>If one had an alignment other than lawful evil and touched the blade they would be overcome by a feeling of nauseating pain. This would occur even to creatures of a neutral evil or chaotic evil alignment, though the pain they would experience was of a lesser degree.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The true origins of this blade was a mystery to most people, which was further complicated by there being many conflicting legends surrounding it.</p>
