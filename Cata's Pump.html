<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1369 DR Cata's Pump was an established eatery in Scornubel . On that year, it was visited by Dove Falconhand , who disguised herself as an old peddler called Tarthan; she had learned from a local contact, Blaskar Toldovar , that a massive drow infiltration of Scornubel had taken place. When she ordered as Tarthan, there were numerous traders sitting in the common room of the inn, all having finished their meals and nobody talking, actually spell-changed drow. After ordering, the pretend-peddler left before he was served, but one of the people there followed him. The tray he was given, in fact, was a little dusty.</p>
<p>She turned up again later that evening in the guise of a drow woman, possibly noble, answering to the name of Iylinvyx, who wanted to trade glowcap mushrooms and deep wines for some luxuries. She was directed, hesitatingly, to speak with Sarltan .</p>
