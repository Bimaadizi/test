<p>The Well of the Cloven Rock was a popular well and oasis in Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The oasis was located in the Hills of Scent in the Sword , about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Elah'zad .</p>
<p>The oasis consisted of a large, crescent-shaped lake, surrounded by many varieties of trees, within a grass-filled, bowl-shaped valley in the hills. The lake was fed by a powerful spring that gushed form from a cleft in a large rock in the center of the meadow. At the end of the meadow, the lake drained into a tiny stream that circled the perimeter of the valley.</p>
<p>A well was also here, from before the spring burst forth.</p>
<h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
<p>Lions roamed the area and lived near the oasis when not hunting in the Hills of Scent.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The oasis and well were popular among the Bedine tribes. When they encamped here, they always drove away the lions and then posted pairs of guards armed with spears , bows , and swords to keep the tribe safe.</p>
