<p>The Sailors' Own was a rather shabby tavern near the docks in Waterdeep 's Castle Ward .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tavern stood on Sail Street , across from the mouth of Tarnished Silver Alley .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This building stood a single story tall. Due to its proximity to the docks, there was a strong smell outside of fish and rotting seaweed .</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The ceilings in this building were rather low-beamed.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>This place was regularly crowded and filled with the smell of various, and often exotic, tobaccos . The clientele were primarily sailors and they didn't take too kindly to customers of a different sort.</p>
<p>There were often men playing some form of board game or cards and whenever a man got too drunk they were left to sleep the night through. Those who were feeling sick were expected to make their way outside of the building. And anyone who started a fight was likely to be thrown out the front door by the tavern's proprietor.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Sailors' Own served horse , pork , and oxen meat. They were served in either roast portions, at a price of two copper pieces per platter, or stewed with onions and greens for a price of one copper piece per bowl.</p>
<p>In terms of beverages, the Sailors' Own served ale at 2 cp per tankard, brandy or zzar at 4 cp per tallglass, stout at 3 cp per tankard, and whiskey at 1 silver piece per tallglass.</p>
<p>Besides the usual tavern provender, the proprietor Guthlakh Imyiir sold a variety of nautical charts of areas along the Sword Coast and areas around the Sea of Swords at prices ranging from 45 gold pieces and up, with his best or rare charts fetching prices upwards of hundreds.</p>
