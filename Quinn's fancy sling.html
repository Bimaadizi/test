<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , this fancy sling was blessed by Quinn Silverfinger's head priest from the Golden Spires in Amn . Proud of the honor, Quinn carried the weapon with him wherever he went. Over the years, he only got to use the enchanted sling three times. In 1281 DR, the sling was still in Quinn Silverfinger's possessions, stashed away in his chambers inside the Golden Lodge , a small temple to Waukeen in Lonelywood, Icewind Dale .</p>
