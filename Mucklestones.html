<p>The Mucklestones were a ring of standing stones on the northeastern tip of the Forest of Lethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mucklestones were a ring of standing stones that bordered a cleared out, circular bowl on the land. The stones were about six feet tall, two feet deep, four feet wide, and etched with nature runes. Normally, there was a ring of trees surrounding the stones, whose branches reached out above the hollow bowl, essentially covering it. While in Gameliel 's holding, the branches atop the bowl were bare and dead, with the stones themselves were covered in slime and fungi. This effect began to recede almost as soon as the blightlord died.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , the Mucklestones formed an elaborate arrangement that occassionally shifted about; elder druids had tracked it, claiming that sometimes the entire clearing moved, taking the stones along with it, though never very far. By 1497 DR , the Mucklestones were known to shift from time to time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>the Mucklestones were in the keeping of the druid Briartan since at least 1372 DR until he was defeated by the blightlord Gameliel , who hung him from the stones for torture, in 1373 DR . The blightlord used the Mucklestones as a staging area for his blightspawned volodni and their raids.</p>
<p>After the blightlord's demise, his power over the stones receded on its own.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Mucklestones served as magical portals, allowing access to places throughout Faerûn. At least one of those portals led into Sunglade deep in the Yuirwood ; each portal had druidic script pointing where they lead, though it was nigh-undecipherable to outsiders. Other portals led to other forests in Faerûn, but some of the portal keys ha been lost over time. Using the keystone , Ususi Manaallin opened a portal into the Celestial Nadir .</p>
<p>By 1497 DR , many of the portals accessible through the Mucklestones had broken down or been rerouted because of the Spellplague .</p>
