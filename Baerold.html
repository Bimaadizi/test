<p>Baerold was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to Ganrahast and Vainrence , Baerold had suggested finding blueflame items to command blueflame ghosts , which had left them quite suspicious he may be an agent from elsewhere. However, no amount of probing and divination revealed him to be more than an ambitious youngling. Thus, they simply slowed down his training and watched him carefully instead of taking harsher measures as of Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR .</p>
