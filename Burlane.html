<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Mirtul 6 of 1374 DR , Burlane was already the leader of the Company of the Bright Spear . He had visited places before, at least one of which was Suzail , and the company had a charter from King Azoun IV .</p>
<p>On that date, during the company's stop in Highmoon , where they stopped at the Rising Moon , the company's skulker, Lynxal , was slain by a local veteran, Ghondarrath , after trying to stab the old warrior, who had caught him pickpocketing; though the situation almost deteriorated into a full-on carnage, the timely intervention of the innkeeper, Gorstag , prevented it. After they retreated to their chambers for the evening, they found much of their valuables stolen; a lass at the inn, Shandril Shessair , revealed herself as the thief, and asked to become their next thief.</p>
<p>They accepted; over the next days, Burlane led them to Myth Drannor , and on the evening of Mirtul 12 they made camp in particular at the shores of the Semberflow ; he took third watch. When the next day they were attacked by a mule train of armed men, Burlane was injured after hurling his own bright spear , and was protected effectively by Shandril, then a neophyte, until Elminster happened by and cast a spell terrifying the men, almost certainly fear . He sent afterwards for Shandril to skulk ahead and pursue the foes. He rescued her afterwards when the men she was pursuing caught her.</p>
<p>During the fighting once they found the area towards which the mule train was headed, the Company of the Bright Spear fought a magician sentry, protecting a stronghold belonging to the Cult of the Dragon at the Gates of Doom , at Oversember Vale , on Mirtul 20 , where they were ambushed. In the fight, Burlane was slain by a green dragon 's breath, after a spell from the sentry entangled him in sticky strands, almost certainly being a web spell. Delg confirmed his demise at a later date.</p>
