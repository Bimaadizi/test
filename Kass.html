<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Ulma led her monster hunter tribe to the city of Baldur's Gate, where they found themselves targeted by vampires . During the Absolute crisis , when the Gurs camped in the Rivington district of the city, along with a small army of refugees displaced by the conflict, the tribe's children were abducted by Astarion Ancunín under orders from Cazador Szarr .</p>
<p>Posters with charcoal drawings of Kass' face were found in the Lower City , promising a reward for any information on the child's fate. Kass, along with other abducted Gur children, was turned into a vampire spawn to be used in a hellish ritual by Cazador. Subsequently, Astarion Ancunín found himself broken out from under Cazador's control and, along with the Absolute Adversaries , sought to infiltrate his old master's home. The outcome of Astarion's infiltration and the fate of the Gur children remained unconfirmed.</p>
