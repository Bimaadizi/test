<p>Coal was a werewolf from Moray in the Moonshae Isles during the late 15 th century DR . He was slain in the late 1470s DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his wolf form, Coal was a heavy brute with reddish fur and a black mark on his forehead, which was the inspiration for his name.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the son of Deucala , who had been a matriarch of the Black Blood tribe in northern Moray as of the mid-to-late 15 th century DR. When Deucala found the Lady Amaranth in the late 1460s DR, and raised her, the young fey woman became like a sister to Coal, and was the one who named him. Coal and his sisters were fiercely protective of Amaranth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Amaranth became the de facto leader of the lycanthropes at Caer Moray , she led them to be peaceful and productive. Only females were allowed to reside within the walls, so it became Coal's duty to travel the island and bring back news.</p>
<p>Following the revival of the god Malar in the late 1470s DR, the community at Caer Moray was destroyed by the Black Blood tribe in the Battle of Caer Moray , and Lady Amaranth left it behind. Coal was the only lycanthrope she asked to join her, and he helped her and her guide Lukas to follow the signs left by the goddess Chauntea that would take her to a portal in the Breasal Marsh , which in turn would take her home to Sarifal . Coal was the first to arrive at the portal , where he encountered a female wolf who seemed interested in him. Unknown to Coal, this was in fact a shapechanged druid named Eleuthra Davos , who was toying with him in order to make her lover, a swordmage known as the Savage , jealous. Unfortunately, the Savage was aware that the blood of a lycanthrope was needed to activate the portal , and he slew Coal to do so. Lady Amaranth tried to avenge him, but lost her chance when an aspect of Malar arrived, forcing her to flee through the portal.</p>
