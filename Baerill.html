<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Baerill was the daughter of Buldegas Mhaerkoon , and sister to Asanta . They chatted constantly and had noisy arguments.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Buldegas Mhaerkoon was the long-time owner of the Wyvern Watch Inn, but following the devastation of the neighboring city of Arabel during the Goblin War in 1370 DR , Buldegas chose to relocate there and build a new inn. He took away his money and some of his best employees and left his daughters in charge of the Wyvern.</p>
<p>Baerill and Asanta had recently taken charge by 1374 DR . They conveniently forgot Buldegas's instructions about watering down the drink, and their regular banter and arguing was a popular form of entertainment there. This made the Wyvern more popular with patrons.</p>
