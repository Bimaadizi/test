<p>Faker's Crown was the enchanted decoy headdress that belonged to a king whose name was lost to time.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Faker's Crown carried several enchantments that enhanced the wearer's senses. While it was worn, it improved the wearer's hearing and allowed them to cast amplify and clairaudience/clairvoyance spells once per day each.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even though the name of the king who commissioned this crown was lost to time, the story was not. The king ordered the creation of Faker's Crown after realizing that his advisers were plotting a coup. In secrecy, the king replaced the real crown with Faker's Crown just before the coronation. The enchanted headwear allowed the king to crack the conspiracy and capture the treasonous aides. Following that event, Faker's Crown became a supplemental symbol of regency.</p>
<p>Sometime later, a rogueish traveling bard swapped the fake and real crowns, leaving the Faker's Crown in the vault. The same night, she performed for the king. He was so mesmerized by the bard's music that he offered her anything from the castle's treasury. The woman claimed Faker's Crown and was never seen again.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , the Faker's Crown fell into the hands of Feldran Exeltis of the Exeltis noble family, whose winery keep was located in the Blade Cliffs of the Sword Coast .</p>
