<p>Talagbar was a dwarven mine in eastern Vaasa . It was considered a "twin" of the Delhalls in western Vaasa.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Talagbar was located in the Galena Mountains to the east of the road from Nigel's Ford to Palischuk .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 13 th century DR , Talagbar had long been frozen under the Ice Run of the Great Glacier , but was believed to be rich with deposits of bloodstone , emerald , ruby , copper , and iron .</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR , melting at the edge of the Glacier exposed Talagbar along with its twin, the Delhalls. The two mines were said to be so rich in wealth that their discovery changed the culture of Vaasa, making its people more greedy.</p>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR, the mines had been reopened.</p>
