<p>Gathgaer Milomynt was a cleric of Shar in the Dark Army of the Night and a slaver in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gathgaer posed as a healer and seller of medicines and other treatments, including herbs and ingredients he imported himself, for purposes from cosmetics to embalming.</p>
<p>In fact, he was a slaver who kidnapped people of no importance or power, drugged them into unconsciousness, robbed them, and smuggled them to his house in his coach. There, he sent them through a two-way keyed portal within an iron maiden in his house that led to a sarcophagus in the second level of Undermountain . There, he sold the unfortunates to Hlethvagi Anteos of Skullport and other slave-ring operators with their dozen-strong bands of thugs.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a beak-like nose, brown eyes that were beady but alert, and brown hair he kept cut short. He habitually wore dark robes and carried a mace on his belt .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gathgaer appeared to have plain and simple tastes and comforts.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>On Drawn Sword Alley in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep , he lived in a dilapidated two-story row-house . His parlor was dusty and adorned with a dying plant, and furnished with a corner fireplace, a desk, and four chairs. The desk held a sign reading "Gathgaer Milomynt, Medicines & Treatments". For his protection, he kept two hungry, savage, but loyal war dogs , which could be released into his parlor via a secret door operated by a foot-treadle beneath his desk.</p>
<p>From the parlor, a door led to the back room with the bricked-up, unused corner fireplace with shared brick chimney. Gathgaer used this area for work and storage, and it had a big table; a cabinet containing bottles and flasks of medicine, possibility even potions ; and crates of simple foodstuffs, with cheese wheels, round loaves of hard bread , and bottles of sherry , in keeping with Gathgaer's simple tastes. There was also a long rack for hanging both clothes and sausages long one wall, and behind it was an iron maiden, with door left open to show the spikes inside. In fact, these were illusory and the interior was a portal â€”once the door was shut, anyone inside was spirited away to the sarcophagus in Undermountain.</p>
<p>Adjoining this room, beside the stairs, were jakes and a washroom. The ordinary wooden stairs connected to the second story, used as a basic living area. The bedroom had a rickety four-poster bed; Gathgaer kept his coins hidden in a hollow bedpost. He kept his main wealth stashed inside the chimney, in a sack hanging down the lower part and able to pulled up by lifting the hearthstones on the upper-floor fireplace. It held gold coins and silver trade bar totaling over 850 gp .</p>
<p>The Undermountain chamber holding the sarcophagus had plenty of rope and wall-mounted rings for binding captives to await collection. Upon arrival, a dozen crawling claws under Gathgaer's control would grab them and drag them out of the sarcophagus. To return via the portal , one required a command word known only to Gathgaer ( ondreth ).</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As well as his mace, Gathgaer had a ring of protection +2 and a ring of free action , as well as an eye of winking ( command word gulruu ). But the key to his kidnapping was a steel needle concealed his belt buckle and coated in a sticky, clear poison that caused deep sleep on contact; Gathgaer was not himself immune. The poison he kept stashed in a secret compartment behind a loose stone in the chimney of his house, accessed via the back room.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Being a cleric , Gathgaer commanded divine magic , preparing various common spells and whip of Shar .</p>
