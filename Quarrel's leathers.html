<p>Quarrel's leathers was a set of unique enchanted leather armor created by an obsessive half-drow warlock named Quarrel in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The armor was stitched together from fragments of armor that one was worn by warlock Ammon Jerro , Quarrel's beloved idol. This mismatched armor possessed a +2 enchantment and allowed the wearer to cast the bestow curse spell . The armor could also be only worn by warlocks, half-elves, and those who venerated evil.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Quarrel's leathers were the warlock's favorite armor. He wore the leathers into battle during the Quarrel's search for the source of Ammon Jerro's arcane powers. The armor accompanied the half-drow across the Sword Coast North , the Mere of Dead Men , and settled for a while in the Crossroad Keep , before setting out for the land of Thay some years after the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
