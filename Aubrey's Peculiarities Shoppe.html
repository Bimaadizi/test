<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Leilon was destroyed and Aubrey was killed during the Spellplague after 1385 DR , he became bound to Leilon's ruins as a ghost. By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild the town. Aubrey kept a close eye on the town's reconstruction to prevent another calamity. In Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe, he sold magic items to new adventurers so that they could protect Leilon in the future.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Leilon , the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar , possessed by the Ebondeath , crash-landed on Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe and reduced the structure to a mound of shattered masonry.</p>
