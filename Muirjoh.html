<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in early spring, in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a sun elf approached Muirjoh and spread false information about Lord Stedd Moonstar . They spoke of the Waterdhavian 's plans to mine mithral ore from the Sword Mountains, claiming the noble was planning to use the cheapest and most destructive methods available for extracting and moving the ore, including tearing up any plants in his way and displacing any creature inhabiting the Sword Mountains. Finally, the sun elf gave Muirjoh a note describing the appearances of a group of adventurers being sent by Lord Moonstar. Enraged by this news, the half-orc gathered his allies, determined to stop this devastation of the wilderness.</p>
<p>At midday on the following day, Muirjoh and his allies encountered the adventurers hiking up Mount Araddyn towards a stone giant encampment shortly after finishing breakfast. They tried to scare them away, not wanting to kill the adventurers but simply drive them away, though if it was necessary to do so he was willing to live with their deaths being on his hands. According to some a fight did not break out, but instead the adventurers talked things out with Muirjoh, explaining that what he had been told was simply untrue. Lord Moonstar was not intendin to enslave the local sentient creatures, dwarves and stone giants, but to hire and pay them for help with his mining efforts. And some of them went on to explain mining practices that posed minimal harm to the local ecosystem.</p>
<p>Convinced of their sincerity, Muirjoh opined that fighting them would do nothing to prevent Lord Moonstar's desire to extract the mithral and was pleased by their claims. He then offered his assistance in developing a safe means of transporting the mithral down the Mount Araddyn, as well as the powers of him and his allies. But Muirjoh also warned that if Lord Moonstar's efforts ultimately caused harm to the area that was irreparable, he would return to exact vengeance.</p>
