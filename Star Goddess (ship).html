<p>Some time the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the Star Goddess and its crew took to the skies from Halruaa to explore the nearby jungles of Chult . While flying over the peninsula, it was assailed by a flock of pterafolk . They tore open the vessel's blimp and sent it crashing to the tree canopy of the jungles.</p>
<p>Most of the survivors were left marooned, high above the ground beneath them. One of them, Oloma Authdamar, managed to leap from the crashing skyship , but was later captured by the yuan-ti of Omu .</p>
