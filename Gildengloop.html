<p>Gildengloop was a svirfneblin city in the deadly Underdark , long-abandoned by 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gildengloop was an insignificant settlement apart from one detail; it was one of the thirteen destinations of the teleport without error spell ward that protected the hidden lair of a wizard who resided in Nonthal circa the Year of the Tooth, 1270 DR . The wizard's lair - Nonthal's Hold , was protected by thirteen gates that, in not deactivated with the correct command word, spirited the intruder away. Gildengloop was the destination of the ninth gate .</p>
