<p>The Beacon Rocks were a small cluster of about twelve unsettled islands, located almost halfway between the island nation of Nimbral and the Snout of Omgar in the Great Sea .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To all appearances, the islands were barren.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the rule of Calishite emperor Shoon IV , Shoon had constructed a lighthouse to protect sailing ships from the rocky islands.</p>
<p>In 605 DR , a large number of vessels from Western Thindol , whose citizens were escaping unrest and anarchy in their country, crashed upon the Beacon Rocks during a massive storm.</p>
<p>In 1361 DR , two individuals of the Arcane were said to have been living on at least one of the islands.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Beacon Tower of Shoon IV stands on the largest of the islands. It was renamed the Beckoning Tower of Shoon , because of the magical enchantment that had been placed upon it, which compelled those who saw its light to drive their vessels directly towards it and destruction upon the rocks.</p>
