<p>Seskergates was a mansion located in Baldur's Gate that served as the family home of the Sesker mercantile clan, and later as the residence of the Baldurian court- mage , Imbralym Skoond .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of work conducted by the building's first resident, Seskergates had a great number of concealed passageways, secret halls, and hidden exits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The home's first resident was a smuggler within the Sesker family. It continued to serve as their home until the death of the last remaining Sesker, some time in the 15 th century DR . In fact, that individual was killed by a nothic that dwelled in the building's subterranean passages, which were shared by the neighboring Mandorcai's Mansion .</p>
<p>Seskergates was swiftly purchased thereafter by Skoond, who retrofitted it to serve as his arcane workshop. He eventually hired a number of alchemist assistants and henchmen to map out his maze-like home.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
