<p>Kawasa was a tiny farming community and one of the many isolated villages of the Fochu Peninsula in Wa .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The people of Kawasa were much more welcoming of strangers than other settlements of the peninsula.</p>
<p>The village was surrounded by small rice fields. Most of the structures within the village were simple peasant shacks known as minka , built from wood with latticed walls and straw-thatched roofs. Apart from these poor residences were small barns, warehouses, and shops. Several of the minka were abandoned after raids on the village.</p>
<p>The little thorp had a population of only about 75 individuals after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR) .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kawasa was located on the coast of the Sea of Patience , where the Fochu Peninsula joined the mainland of Tsukishima . A trail led from the village west to Chiroi .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Like the other tiny settlements of the region, Kawasa had little contact with the other villages, much less with the rest of Kara-Tur or regions beyond. The people produced rice, but there is no evidence that they traded in it.</p>
<p>The people would allow travelers to spend the night in one of the abandoned minkas for free. The village did not produce anything more expensive than 1 yuan to sell.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>About 8 citizens of Kawasa served in its militia. These persons were only armed with simple clubs or spears .</p>
<h2>Religion</h2>
<p>Unlike the other settlements in the region, the people of Kawasa were not particularly religious.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Setsu Iki , a powerful wu jen , did not live in the village itself but kept a small home in the middle of a peach grove in a shallow valley some 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of Kawasa.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR), deposed coiled dragon Za-Jikku began murdering citizens of the many villages of the Fochu Peninsula, transforming them into magical butterflies, the breath of which would create yun ch'i , the vapor of death, which he would use to live forever. The village of Kawasa suffered especially severely from Za-Jikku's raids.</p>
