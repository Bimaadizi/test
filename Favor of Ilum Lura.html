<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>These magic gloves originated from Nivian , a city in Illefarn. In −1239 DR , the champion of Nivian's Artisan's District was Beloran . He was madly in love with the ruler's niece, the beautiful Ilum Lura . Beloran remained the champion for the next six years, clamoring for the woman's hand through becoming the city's Grand Champion. Ilum's father, impressed with the champion, commanded his daughter to gift Beloran with a traditional token of favor. She presented the champion with a pair of enchanted riding gloves. In the following championship, Beloran fought even fiercer than before as the tradition dictated that the token's presenter was to reward the champion with a kiss. Ilum reluctantly kissed Beloran but revealed that her heart belonged to another. Consumed by maddening grief, Beloran left Nivian forever, still wearing the Favor of Ilum Lura .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , a merchant of Port Llast , Haljal Throndor , owed a vast collection of enchanted items in his special stock.</p>
