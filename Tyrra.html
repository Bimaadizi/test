<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1358 DR, Tyrra followed a "fool" party into the depths underneath Waterdeep , and got herself killed. When resurrected, the arrogant ranger only complained, and assumed the group of adventurers wished her to join them. She mentioned that if they were as foolhardy as the previous party she followed, they would need a lot more help than she could offer.</p>
