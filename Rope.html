<p>A rope was a thick, flexible cord of braided fibers that was used for climbing and other purposes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These fibrous cords were usually made out of hemp or silk . Though in the land of Zakhara , some constructed ship ropes from coconut fibers.</p>
<p>As well as for climbing and tying creatures or items up, ropes could be used as weapons . Though weak, a strong and tight rope in the hands of combatant could be used to slash others.</p>
<p>Rope made from hemp is durable and rugged. The diameter of hemp rope varied, from as small as 0.25 inches (0.64 centimeters) to more than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters). Hemp rope with large diameters was commonly used aboard ships. Hemp rope was heavy. A 50 feet (15 meters) length of hemp rope could weight up to 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms). However, a 50 feet (15 meters) length of hemp rope could hold over 500 pounds (230 kilograms) in weight. It was a preferred type of rope in the Nelanther Isles due to its strength, greater than that of other materials, and hemp being resistant to rot.</p>
<p>Rope made from silk was not as strong as hemp rope but was much lighter. Silk rope was made from long threads of silk, which were braided together into cords, and multiple cord braided together to make the rope. It had a smoother texture than hemp rope. A 50 feet (15 meters) length of silk rope weighed only 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) but could only hold up to 500 pounds (230 kilograms) in weight. It was also much more expensive than hemp rope.</p>
