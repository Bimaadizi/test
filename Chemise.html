<p>Chemise , or shift , was a kind of garment (often feminine, but broadly gender neutral) that resembled a smock , typically made of linen . A chemise could be worn as a simple overgarment (as favored by commoners ) or layered under more fancy clothing like a cote , dress , robe , or doublet to protect them from sweat and bodily oils . Chemise was a common type of garb born by rich and poor alike.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A typical chemise was a smock that covered a woman beginning from her shoulders and to her thigh or mid-calf. Some were sleeveless, while others had short or long sleeves. Some were designed to be held together with ties. Light colors, like white or yellow, were used to dye chemises in Halruaa in the Shining South . Tightly laced chemises were known to wrap bodies of women in the Savage Frontier and in West Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>Chemises sold via Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue were sturdy and pretty enough to be worn as outerwear, not just undergarments. The chemises were priced depending on the material: simple sackcloth was valued at 8 copper coins , linen went for two golds , imported Maztican cotton – three gold pieces, and silk – six gold pieces. Aurora's chemises came only in white, beige, or gray colors.</p>
<p>Cormyrean chemises were dyed in loud red color, but, unlike other variants, were fitted and woven of fine silk. When white chemise of any sleeve length was worn, it was topped with a smock or a bodice .</p>
<p>Commoners of Tethyr wore a significantly simpler variant. Their chemises were drab and brown, made of simple burlap.</p>
<p>Chemise weaved by the drow of Underdark were made of light, almost whisp-like gauzy fabric that offered little to no warmth to the wearer. Elvish chemises were made using pale gray silk and worn underneath gowns .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Female chemises were worn as far back as the days of the ancient Netheril . Some of the Netherese wearers included the Church of Shar , whose priestly garb included black velvet chemise for the women. That fashion was still worn by Shar 's clergy into the late 14 th century DR.</p>
