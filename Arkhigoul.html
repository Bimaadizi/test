<p>Arkhigoul was a lich and former foe of Zhentil Keep who was destroyed some time before 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In a meeting within Zhentil Keep in Mirtul 21 of 1357 DR , the destruction of Arkhigoul was cited by Lord Kalthas as the reason why defending Thar was no longer an issue, almost certainly implying his defeat had been recent and that he had been an obstacle to an effective defense of Thar.</p>
