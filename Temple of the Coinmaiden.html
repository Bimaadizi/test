<p>The Temple of the Coinmaiden was a place dedicated to the worship of Waukeen in the town of Phandalin . It was founded in the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located on the north side of Phandalin, and was thus one of the first buildings that would be seen when entering the town from the Triboar Trail .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple itself was a former general store and trading post called Barthen's Provisions . It was adorned and decorated lavishly, as befitting a house of worship of the goddess of wealth.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The acolytes of the temple, Hesten Jenz and Mischka Solmen , preached and held services, and handled most other public-facing roles. Meanwhile, the highest-ranking member, Ditch Fundi , preferred to simply focus on the temple's finances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>About half-a-year after Barthen's Provisions went out of business in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR , the building was purchased by an unnamed buyer who donated it to the Church of Waukeen . Within a month, the building was renovated and dedicated as a temple under the supervision of gnomish priestess Ditch Fundi .</p>
<p>In truth, the dedication of the building as a temple was simply a ruse to plant Ditch in Phandalin as a spy for a cabal known as The Six . Even the acolytes of the temple had no idea that she was not a real cleric of Waukeen.</p>
