<p>The Anatomy of Hag was a book penned by Knuckles Gallow and published sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , The Anatomy of Hag was studied by Mayrina after forming the Anti-Hag Support Group , in search of ways to stop hags' sinister and malicious plots. The book's lore eventually helped Mayrina discover the recipe for hag's bane â€“ a concoction that could save the life of a child consumed by a hag. The crucial revelation was found in the book's 18 th chapter. Some of the regain combinations tested by Mayrina during the research included failed mixtures of dragon egg mushroom with autumn crocus , and crawler mucus with fibber's trumpet and melloweed . The combination of elmorin wings and whisperlight venom showed potential but was too unstable to be reliable.</p>
