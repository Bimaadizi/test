<p>Miboro Yan ( pronounced : / m i ˈ b aʊ r aʊ ˈ j ɑː n / mee-BOW-row YAHN ) was the proprietor of The Holdup , a popular tavern in Port Nyanzaru 's Old City as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Miboro was well-respected and much beloved among the adventurers who passed through Port Nyanzaru and the people of the Old City alike. Owing to her perceived influence, the Zhentarim became interested in arranging to have Miboro owe them a favor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly after the end of the death curse in the late 15 th century DR, Miboro was captured by undead servants of the necromancer Jaru Tasca while taking her garbage to the refuse pit . By the following evening, an alliance of foreign adventuring factions had assembled a team to rescue her. They were led by Branzen (a Tyrran priest of the Order of the Gauntlet ) and included Dunlo (a dwarf druid of the Emerald Enclave ), Grunk (a Zhentarim orc spy ), Lily (a Zhentarim elf berserker ), Mandolin (a tabaxi bard and Harper ), and Mercer (a human knight in service of the Lords' Alliance ).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this rescue operation was all according to Jaru Tasca's plan, whose real goal in kidnapping Miboro was to lure adventurers to her lair in the catacombs beneath the Old City ziggurats in order to transform them into undead servants to lead the undead forces of her master, Zuccass . By the very next day, Jaru sent an anonymous message to the beggar prince Pock-Marked Po encouraging him to assemble yet more adventurers to send to rescue Miboro. After checking with his contacts in the various factions, Po interrogated her messenger—the albino dwarf Favin Kreeger —before hiring a party to seek her out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jaru Tasca kept Miboro chained in her lair as bait while she began turning the first group of adventurers into undead.</p>
