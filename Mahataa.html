<p>A mahataa was a type of demon found within the Abyss . Mahataas were rumored to originally be elementals that were corrupted by the Abyss. Mahataas were extremely independent and were rarely willing to serve the various demon lords of the Abyss. It was believed that a vast majority of the mahataa were actually in the service of Tharizdun .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mahataas were able to mold and bend the mud and earth around them to be used in combat.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Mahataas did their best to fight alongside their own kind but were not entirely opposed to working with others if it suited them. Mahataas were able to swim through earth within the Abyss and often ambushed their prey using this tactic before quickly burrowing once more.</p>
