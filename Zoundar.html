<p>Zoundar was a settlement at the base of the Lhairghal Peaks and the Halar Hills , on the southern shores of River Halar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zoundar's main industry was electrum mining. The abundance of the precious metal in the city spawned a saying, "wouldn't miss it for all the electrum in Zoundar."</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Zoundar was connected to a small city of Nonthal in Turmish via the fifth of the one-way gates known as the 13 Gates of Magic . The portal transported unlucky individuals into a little-known mountain valley near Zoundar.</p>
