<p>Jagres were extremely powerful humanoids created by Zaltec during the Night of Wailing . High ranking Jaguar Knights were transformed into ogres and a few were later turned into jagres. Jagres were leaders of the orcs and ogres who lived in the Valley of Nexal . They were usually found in the company of orc or ogre servants.</p>
<p>Jagres wore magical armor made from the skin of displacer beasts , which allowed them to transform into the beasts. Some jagres went through a special ritual which bonded the displacer beast skin to their bodies so that it couldn't be removed.</p>
<h2>Physical attributes</h2>
<p>Jagres were huge, brutish humanoids. All jagres had the mark of the Viperhand branded on their chests.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Jagres either wielded huge macas or engaged in unarmed combat. In displacer beast form, the jagre was able to attack with its two tentacles or its claws and bite.</p>
