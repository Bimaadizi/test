<p>Lorbralinth , also known as just lorbral , was a poison found in Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This poisonous liquid was clear, with an oily feel and a pleasant, sweet scent. It was concocted from mixing the saliva of a basilisk , a leucrotta , and fourteen other creatures. It could be added to food or could be used to treat an edged weapon.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Lorbral could be handled relatively safely, but once it was ingested or entered the blood stream through a wound the victim was overcome with chills, then broke out in a raging fever, then came down with chills again, and so on, alternating between too hot and too cold. The victim was wracked by these effects for a short time and then typically recovered (if they survived).</p>
