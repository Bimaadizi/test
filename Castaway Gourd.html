<p>The Castaway Gourd was one of the giant gourds that grew in the Lizard Marsh and used by the swamp's lizardfolk as liquid containers. This particular item made a name for itself by rescuing Aldrine Lugar from being castaway on an uninhabited island off the Sword Coast before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Castaway Gourd was a huge liquid container with a hard shell dyed purple. It was taller than an adult human and was decorated with the carving of the word " butterfly " and three straight line marks next to it.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This giant gourd was a part of a popular story often told by seafarers from Daggerford . The tale was of an unlucky sailor Aldrine Lugar who was swept off the ship's side during a storm and found herself washed ashore on a small, uncharted, rocky island. The island offered very little sustenance, with only grass, scrub bushes, tiny blueberry patches, and wild butterflies found there. Aldrine consumed all edible berries she found scavenge within a couple of days. The local colorful fluttering butterflies symbolized freedom to the woman. When she ran out of food, Aldrine resigned to the fate of starving to death on the lonely rock. However, her salvation was washed ashore overnightâ€”a giant hollow gourd. The sailor recognized it from the stories about vicious lizardmen of the Lizard Marsh and assumed it floated out of the marsh and into the Sea of Swords . The gourd was corked, which kept it from sinking. Aldrine Lugar carved the word "butterfly" on its surface, affixed herself to the new flotation device using vines from the island, and set off into the sea. With Umberlee 's grace, the woman found herself at the neck of Delimbiyr River three days later.</p>
<p>By 1372 DR, the Castaway Gourd was proudly displayed in Torleth's Treasures , the curio store of Gillian's Hill .</p>
