<p>Xxiphu , also known as the Soaring City , was an ancient mobile aboleth city from the Far Realm that had existed on Abeir-Toril since prehistoric times.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Xxiphu was a glyph-inscribed obelisk with tentacles sprawling from its walls, wrapped in an eternal storm that soared over the surface of the world. The inscriptions on the surface of the obelisk depicted thousands of interconnected images that were constantly changing. The full meaning of the evolving inscription was too alien for mortal minds to comprehend and remain sane. Reality was altered around Xxiphu's vicinity, periodically spawning aberrations from the Far Realm onto the world.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient city of Xxiphu originally came to Abeir-Toril from the Far Realm when the world was young. Xxiphu plummeted to the world and settled deep below what was later the Sea of Fallen Stars . When Abeir-Toril was sundered into two twin planets, Abeir and Toril , the city of Xxiphu remained on Abeir. During the Spellplague , Xxiphu was transported to Faerûn during the Wailing Years . The monolith city was first raised over the Sea of Fallen Stars near Cormyr in 1389 DR .</p>
<p>The aboleths native to Toril were startled when they became aware of the ancient city's reappearance, and at first attacked the ancient aboleths who dwelled inside Xxiphu. Over time, however, both factions of aboleths were able to coexist in an uneasy peace, although the Torilian aboleths avoided being near Xxiphu.</p>
<p>In 1396 DR , the aboleths of Xxiphu forced kuo-toa into their service. Shortly after, Malyanna moved Xxiphu to the Citadel of the Outer Void on the fringe of the Feywild to open the Living Gate to the Far Realm, but failed.</p>
<p>In 1429 DR , Xxiphu returned from the Citadel of the Outer Void to the sky above the Sea of Fallen Stars. As of 1479 DR , Xxiphu could be spotted hovering across the skies over the sea, usually near Akanûl .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Within Xxiphu dwelt the original aboleths who came to Toril shortly after the creation of the world, known as the Abolethic Sovereignty .</p>
