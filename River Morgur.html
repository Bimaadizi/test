<p>The River Morgur was the northernmost tributary of the Neverwinter River , located in the Neverwinter Wood.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The river's mouth was located in the northeastern part of the Neverwinter River, south of Morgur's Mound . From there, the River Morgur weaved south, where it merged with the Neverwinter River. Like other tributaries, Morgur's waters were warm and teemed with fish , turtles , and other aquatic life. However, unlike its sisters, River Morgur was rumored to be home to some unknown "river monsters." The stories' truthfulness was questionable, and the descriptions of the said monsters varied greatly among eyewitnesses.</p>
