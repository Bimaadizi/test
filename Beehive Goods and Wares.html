<p>Beehive Goods and Wares was a general store located on Stormshore Street in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , run by Oliver Tefoco in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Beehive Goods and Wares was located in a small two-storied building somewhere roughly the southeast of The Blushing Mermaid in the Lower City and just south of the Crimson Draughts shoppe. The shop's entrances were located under an arch formed by the building's second floor that stretched north over the street to another exit located on the second floor, used by the Tefoco and living quarters. The sign that hung above the entrance depicted a beehive surrounded by bottles of wine and crates. The shop itself was on the building's first floor, with the room filled with cupboards and shelves of goods that included food, potions , wines, and some general miscellany.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Beehive Goods and Wares was run by Oliver Tefoco and was home to his spouse Kroyce Tefoco and two youngest children– Hemjax and Maggie . The family's older children lived in other parts of the city and traveled with merchant caravans along the Sword Coast North . When the cultist army of The Absolute targeted the Gate and began a march to attack it, Beehive Goods and Wares became the home to Oliver only as he sent his spouse and children to their family in Beregost , out of harm's way. Beehive remained abuzz with business through the tumult of the coming war. During that time, Notale's Hostel that sheltered refugees, asked Oliver Tefoco for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Wares's own supplier– Durinbold & Oathoon , Provisoners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate.</p>
