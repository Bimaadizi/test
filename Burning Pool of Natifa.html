<h2>Geography</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pool measured 40 ft (12 m) wide and was 20 ft (6.1 m). The water of the pool had a sweet smell of lemons and roses. Spindly plants called arafaj covered the entire surface of the pool, burning continuously and illuminating the entire pool with a magical glow that could be seen 10 mi (16 km) away. These plants burned whenever they were in contact with the pool's surface; even rain did not extinguish them.</p>
<p>Periodically, a fountain would shoot water 20 ft (6.1 m)) into the air.</p>
<p>A stone oven could be found near the southern end of the pool, complete with pots and other accessories.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The pool took its name from Natifa , a ghost who inhabited the pool.</p>
