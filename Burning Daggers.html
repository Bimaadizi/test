<p>The Burning Daggers were a fanatical Kossuth -worshiping group of orcs in Thar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each of them was branded in the center of the face with a dagger symbol as a sign of devotion.</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>They inhabited deep caverns in Thar, around twenty miles from Glister , where there was a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire , into which they threw anyone they took captive. A black flaming dagger floated in the air inside this rift. It had been the focus of many searches by the Black Flame Zealots for a long time.</p>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>The branding of each orc took place once a year as a sign of devotion to Kossuth. The dagger brand covered the whole of the center of the face, with the point reaching towards the chin and the pommel on the forehead.</p>
