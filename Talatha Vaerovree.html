<p>Talatha Vaerovree was the Magister from 1370 DR to 1385 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was reasonable, of good humor, taking pleasure in simple things, though a trifle lonely. She delighted in creating new magic, and was endlessly curious about the world.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of the early 1370s, Talatha had traveled extensively in the Sword Coast lands south of Waterdeep , also visiting the Vilhon Reach and Cormyr . She was especially fond of Hawkhill in Amn , the farms between the Unicorn Run and Secomber , and Deepingdale . She liked to bathe in a waterfall on the eastern Thunder Peaks , upstream of Lake Sember .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was slim, of average height, ash-blonde with disturbingly black brows and eyes as gray as smoke. She wears her shoulder-length hair loose, binding it with a string for when she's cooking or working magic. Her movements were described as elegant; she favored sideslit gowns, so as to not feel too warm or too constricted.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Talatha was able with the dagger , darts , and slings . She was also an accomplished singer, cook, artist, swimmer, and dancer. Besides being proficient at sensing her own direction, she not only could read and write, but handled herself well with ancient languages, an in spellcraft.</p>
<p>She also had the extremely rare ability to concentrate on multiple magics at one time.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Besides a number of mundane possessions as normal for a traveler, by 1370 DR she bore a powerful, enchanted dagger, a ring of regeneration , the Eye of Angalar , and a girdle of fire . She also had taken unofficial possession of Castle Endreth , where she hid a stone of magic missiles , and kept a set of spellbooks hidden near a midden in Innarlith . Two Magisterial spellbooks were hidden for her use, one near Suzail and one in the Rat Hills near Waterdeep .</p>
<p>By 1372 DR , she had swapped eye , girdle and stone for a staff of thunder and lightning and gained a ring of protection of extremely high power.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She had been taken from her home in a raid, where she was saved by one of the pirates, Mirt ; the pirate later left her with Onlagar Blurnwood .</p>
<p>As the Magister, Talatha had most contact with Azuth . She had once been fond, but later grown suspicious of Boroland Nevilard . She had gained the enmity of Indolrere Moravan , who had been driven away by her and her master when he tried to attack them. She'd also been the subject of much resentment from Saerla Thimroon . Mlanduvver Tassio had also hired magelings to go after her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After being taken by Mirt during a pirate raid, she was delivered to the mage Onlagar Blurnwood in Innarlith for her education. Onlagar taught her well, and she became both his apprentice and his errand runner. During this time, she took to observing much of Innarlith unseen, so as to not arouse the suspicion that people in Innarlith had of wizards and adventurers. At one point, the two of them together fought Indolrere Moravan .</p>
<p>After Onlagar's death, she wanted to leave and see more of the Realms, but something about her dared not leave her falling-down house. At some point during this time, Mlanduvver Tassio attempted to take objects from the house, and she threw deadly magic his way to stop him. She became known as the Shadow Sorceress of Innarlith, hiding when people came to look for her. Through this time, she met Boroland Nevilard, who at first mistook her for an apparition. She developed the ability to concentrate on multiple spells through this time, animating chairs at the same time as she created music to dance to. A Chosen of Mystra might've brought her to Azuth's notice at this time. He began testing her by having Weavespinners leave magic in her reach, which she assumed to have belonged to her late master; the god also made her dream of magic, to monitor her reaction.</p>
<p>Finally, he asked her to become the Magister on Marpenoth 24 , partly out of curiosity. By 1372 DR , she had seen been to Halruaa , and conversed with some of the great mages of the North.</p>
<p>Talatha died in 1385 DR after the Spellplague . Before she died, she was disguised as Larloch , helping Elminster make Manshoon vow not to hunt any more Zhentarim wizards; her head pretty much melted from the inside out after accumulating sufficient damage since the destruction of the Weave . She was briefly succeeded by Helacorte Darimmon .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>During her tenure as the Magister, Talatha embarked in a number of missions with Azuth to bring more magic into everyday life.</p>
