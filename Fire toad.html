<p>Fire toads were a unique species of toad .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The body of a fire toad measured 4 feet (1.2 meters) in length and had red leathery skin covered in rough, purple warts.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>In contrast to many species of toad, fire toads displayed a sense of hydrophobia and sought to avoid being in contact with liquid whenever possible. Throwing liquid at a fire toad was known to make it retreat, but also hostile.</p>
<p>They rarely attacked other creatures unless provoked, threatened, or defending their lair.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fire toads were capable of spitting small fireballs from their mouths out to a range of 30 feet (9.1 meters). These fireballs typically had a blast radius of around 5 ft (1.5 m).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Instead of attacking with their tongue like other species of toad, a fire toad relied solely on its unique ability to spit out fireballs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time thousands of years prior to the 14 th century DR , the fire toads that inhabited areas beneath the Giantspire Mountains were deprived of the ankheg larvae they regularly consumed by an explosion in their habitat's umber hulk population. Instead of slowly dying out, the fire toads adapted to eating beetles and other insect species in their habitat.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Due to their hydrophobia, fire toads typically inhabited dry regions with a warm to temperate climate.</p>
<p>In Faerûn , these creatures could be found in the Fire Marshes of High Moor and underneath the Giantspire Mountains.</p>
<p>In the Hordelands they inhabited Semphar , the Raurin desert , and the Quoya Desert . They also inhabited tropical and subtropical deserts in neighboring Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>Beyond Toril , fire toads could be found in tropical and subtropical deserts on the planet Oerth .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Some efreeti were known to domesticate fire toads.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The blood of a fire toad could be mixed with the blood of a red dragon in a broth to enchant its tooth .</p>
