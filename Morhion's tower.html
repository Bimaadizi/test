<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tower has many floors. Morhion's study was an octagonal chamber at the top of the tower. Tidy bookshelves stood along the walls and the floors were covered with intricate Sembian rugs. The chamber had a hearth and it was lit by dozens of candles and scented with dried herbs that provided a faint, sweet, dusty fragrance. In the room there was a table of polished rosewood.</p>
<p>Below the tower, there was a magical portal. It was made by a powerful conjurer who dwelt in the tower many years before. The portal was in a circular room made of stone.</p>
