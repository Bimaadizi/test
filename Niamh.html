<p>Niamh was a musically-inclined gynosphinx guardian in Myth Drannor , who remained there at least until the late 14 th century DR in the service of Oghma .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The sphinx protected the inner sanctum of the House of Song when Zelliira and her allies came looking for the Icon of the Humans in 1374 DR . Impressed by their efforts navigating the music-based puzzles and tricks in the temple, Niamh delivered a final challenge on behalf of Oghmaâ€”fighting her in direct combat and proving their valor. After a fierce battle, Niamh admitted their strength and allowed them to access the treasures she guarded.</p>
