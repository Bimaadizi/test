<p>Shahaerynus was a drow sage who documented the history of his race.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Shahaerynus dedicated time in an attempt to document the drow of the Underdark . This, however, was a difficult task, as Lolth -worshiping drow tended to "rewrite history" by pretending traitors to the Spider Queen never existed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the 14 th century DR , the sage penned a tome known as The High History of the Drow . Many years later, Elminster 's apprentice, Susprina Arkhenneld , began work on a sequel to the sage's great work.</p>
