<p>Parhek was the last and least fortunate ruling dynasty of Amn , which lasted merely from 1237 DR to 1276 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The family came to prominence in the Year of the Grotto, 1237 DR when King Belhinn Wavegold II died fighting the Black Horde . The crown passed through his only child Peldara to her husband Malek Parhek , making him the first king of the new dynasty. The new royal family had a brief and unfortunate existence as misfortune and conspiracy bedevilled them. Mercantile powers grew in strength under their reign, continually subverting and stressing the realm, and each king had but a short reign before they died young.</p>
<p>The situation came to a head in the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR when King Dhanar was assassinated by the agents of ambitious merchants and the realm collapsed into civil war. His children were scattered to protect them, but Prince Dhanar was assassinated in Tethyr by the Eldreth Veluuthra , Princess Rasa was tracked down in Silverymoon by Amnian agents, and Prince Malek was finally located in Waterdeep . The final Parhek died in 1306 DR at the hands of the manipulator Arlen Bormul , who poisoned Prince Rohav after exhausting his usefulness as a tool.</p>
<p>The period of Amn's internal conflict only ended in 1333 DR , when Thayze Selemchant halted the Great Amnian Trade War and unified the land under the Council of Six .</p>
