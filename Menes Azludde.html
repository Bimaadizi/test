<p>Menes Azludde was the lead priest of Cyric in Skullport in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Menes was handsome and charismatic, but also scheming and very ambitious. His goal was to rule not only Skullport, but Waterdeep and after the whole North .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>While he led his faithful in preaching and finding converts, Menes also worked to build his small cult into a criminal enterprise similar to the local skulker gangs of Skullport. At the same time, he sought to undermine the Shadow Port's balance of power and amass more influence for himself, an ambition that seemed likely to be beyond his capabilities.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beginning with his arrival in Skullport in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , Menes plotted to turn the devotion of the people of Skullport to the Black Sun. Under his leadership, the church of Cyric swiftly rose to become one of the forces to be reckoned with in the town, albeit a minor one.</p>
<p>As he amassed followers, he began to set in motion a complex plan involving dozens of beings working independently, seemingly on unrelated tasks, all meant collectively to sow chaos and undermine Skullport's power structures. His aim was to cause people to lose faith in the status quo, and ultimately to look to the church of Cyric for stability. By the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Menes's plans had attracted the ire of most other major players in the Shadow Port, including the Agents of the Eye , the Dark Dagger , the Harpers , the Iron Ring , the Keepers , and, most unfortunately, the Skulls of Skullport .</p>
