<p>Megapedes were gigantic, centipede -like creatures that could be found in deserts and other sandy environments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They had extremely long, segmented bodies that were covered in coarse, bristly hairs. At birth, a megapede measured around 20​ to ​30 feet (6.1​ to ​9.1 meters) in length, and grew to its full size within three months. On average, a full sized megapede measured around 100​ to ​150 feet (30​ to ​46 meters) in length. Hundreds of pairs of legs extended from either sides of the body, each measuring 5 feet (1.5 meters) and tipped with flexible claws. There was one pair of legs every 2 feet (0.61 meters).</p>
<p>The head of each megapede featured enormous, powerful mandibles.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Megapedes possessed tremorsense , which allowed them to detect anything else underground within a range of 120 ft (37 m).</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>A megapede buried itself beneath the surface of sand , or within rocky caverns, waiting to strike out against any unawares creature that would become its next meal.</p>
<p>While the poisonous bite of a megapede could be quite lethal, its most potent weapon was the psychic bomb it employed. Each megapade exuded an aura of necrotic energy that drained the life of nearby creatures, and made them susceptible to a unique psychic attack that would incapacitate them.</p>
