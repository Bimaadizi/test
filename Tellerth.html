<p>Tellerth was a medium-sized town found in the Barony of Polten in Damara . It was a farming community.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Situated with its fields along the edge of the Rawlinswood , Tellerth was the easternmost settlement found in Damara. It lay along the Long Road , connecting it to the Merchant's Run to the south and to Narfell to the north.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Vaasan War of 1347 DR , the Baron of Polten, Donlevy the Old , decided to hide his baby son among the folk of Tellerth in order to keep him safe. Thus, Donlevy the Young grew up as a simple farmer in the town.</p>
<p>During the Bloodstone Wars of 1359 DR , The people of Tellerth adopted an isolationist outlook even from their own barony, turning their back on Baron Zorth Bel Maris when the Morov – Ostel –Polten alliance failed to send troops to support the army of Bloodstone . When Donlevy the Young returned to the Polten capital of Trailsend to claim his birthright later that year, he was able to reestablish the barony's ties with Tellerth. The teenage ruler brought counselors with him from Tellerth, thus granting the town a presence at the Polten court.</p>
<p>The people of Tellerth at this time were supportive of Gareth Dragonsbane , and reserved a special enthusiasm for his Twilight Riders , who headed to the town in 1359 DR.</p>
<p>Until the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , any aspirations that Tellerth's people had of logging in the Rawlinswood were stopped by the local druids of the Circle of Leth . However, the Circle was driven from the woods by the Rotting Man that year. This left the woods without their defenders, but also left Tellerth vulnerable to the Rotting Man as well.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The inhabitants of Tellerth were known for their independent mindset. As a whole, they were distrustful of strangers.</p>
<p>Tellerth's relationship with the centaurs of Rawlinswood was not as good as it could have been, and the leader of those centaurs in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , known as the Prancer , was known to strongly dislike human settlements so close to the forest.</p>
