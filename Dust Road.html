<p>The Dust Road , also known as the Road of Dust , was a commercial road running through Southeast Faer没n and East Faer没n .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the Road of Dust linked the Great Rift , Unther and Mulhorand . From south to northeast, it linked Eartheart and Delzimmer , Hardcastle , Unthalass , Gheldaneth , Neldorild and Skuld .</p>
<p>With the dissolution of Mulhorand and the destruction of Unther and the Great Rift after the Spellplague of 1385 DR , the Dust Road became part of the new nations of East Rift , Tymanther and High Imaskar .</p>
<p>The road was rebuilt by the Tymantherans and renamed the Dust Road. This rebuilt road linked Eartheart and Delzimmer, Underwatch , Djerad Thymar , Ruinspoke , and Gheldaneth.</p>
<p>With the restoration of Mulhorand after the Second Sundering , in 1487 DR , the Dust Road served as the link between the southern dwarven cities, Tymanther and Mulhorand.</p>
<p>The Dust Road was specially dangerous near the Black Ash Plain , as ash giants were known to frequently attack caravans.</p>
