<p>Dartabba Shoukyn was a member of the Phaerdinzer clan and the most likely heir to the clan as of 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Dartabba did a number of different jobs while raising her children, amongst which she counted the tailoring of dresses through magic: she used her powers to convert a dress into five or six different ones for the ladies of her local high society. She also danced quite well, and performed as an escort for many men, the wives of some of which had also hired her for their clothes.</p>
<h2>History & Relationships</h2>
<p>As of 1370 DR , she was a widow whose husband had been "a reckless warrior" and the last of his clan. She was the natural successor to leadership of hers. She'd also raised their six children alone, and per some characterizations, "on nothing at all".</p>
