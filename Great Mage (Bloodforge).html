<p>The Great Mage was the title of a bloodforge mage in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ). It was also a byword for any tactically skilled bloodforge mage.</p>
<h2>Works</h2>
<p>The Great Mage taught a number of principles of warfare related to the function and philosophy of the bloodforge and basal golems and their use in battle, together with mana and mystical sites . His adherents labeled the bloodforge "the mother of battle", a thing pregnant with magic that gave life to armies, with basal golems "the children of battle", who would serve without question or doubt. They saw mana as a kind of food that fed their war effort. They saw themselves as masters of battle who would achieve greatness through conflict.</p>
<p>The Great Mage also created the "oracle", a marble interface that each mage who'd mastered a bloodforge could use to issue commands to their army while they took a place high above the battlefield.</p>
<p>In his own teachings, he used the term "Mage" for a hypothetical bloodforge mage and "Great Mage" for one who demonstrated superior tactical skill and leadership ability. Other writers and campaigners, such as Baykon the Bard , the Epic Urus , Grey Shian , Haliph Axe , Pavisi the Prophet , and Tok Ville the Traveler adopted this term, and hence "Great Mage" could also be seen as a byword for any talented military commander and bloodforge mage. For example, Tyranis Shagal was known as a "great mage", while Aelric the Avenger was said to be heir to a legacy of great mages.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Great Mage was depicted as the quintessential image of the wizard : an old man with woolly white hair, mustache, and beard, with glasses and wearing purple robes and pointed hat adorned with stars. He spoke in a high, squeaky voice.</p>
