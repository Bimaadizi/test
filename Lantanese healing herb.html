<p>Lantanese healing herbs were strange herbs from Lantan that possessed strong curative properties.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lantanese healing herbs were low-growing curious plants. Each of its leaves had a big fluid-filled bladder on top, weighting around 0.3 pounds (0.14 kilograms). The liquid was a healing juice that could be easily extracted by rolling the leaf. Each bladder had curative wipers on par with the cure moderate wounds spell .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Not surprisingly, Lantanese healing herbs originated from the island of Lantan . There, the strange plant was cultivated for its medicinal properties. The plant later was brought to an illegal Lantanese gnome logging camp in the jungles of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . The herb plants quickly spread throughout the area surrounding the camp by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
