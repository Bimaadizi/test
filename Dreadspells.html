<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , the Sharrans at the House of Holy Night developed a rite through which they could use a captive aspect of Mystra , the sorceress-queen Dasumia , to cast the spells of wizards. The newly formed group of priests that would employ such arcane magic was dubbed the Dreadspells, and they were soon sent after Elminster Aumar , a Chosen of Mystra , who had been spotted near Westgate .</p>
<p>The Dreadspells tracked Elminster to a ruin, fighting the elven mage Ilbryn Starym along the way with only one casualty. On finding the ruin, which was Karsus's Keep , they seized much magic. They tried to use it to slay Elminster, but failed due to the intervention of the god Azuth and the undead Netherese sorceress Saeraede Lyonora . The group was completely slain soon after by the successive efforts of Klalaera , an enforcer of Shar come to herd them back into the fray after they fled Azuth, then the mages Umbregard and Starsunder , who attacked them while they were being pushed back towards Azuth, and finally the archmage Tenthar Taerhamoos , who finished them off.</p>
