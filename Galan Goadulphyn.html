<h2>History</h2>
<p>Galan was a warrior of Cormanthor. During 241 DR , he was heavily indebted to a number of Houses in Cormanthyr ; while pondering how to acquire different loans to pay off his creditors, he learned of Elminster Aumar being named armathor from Athtar Nlossae ; while at first violently skeptical of the importance of such things, he became interested in the idea of using the chaos as cover to eliminate some rivals. Not long after, they nearly became involved in the duel between Elminster and Delmuth Echorn , as the spell duel threatened to bury or blast a cache of coins of Galan's. Delmuth Echorn's skull, which came loose in the battle, was launched afterwards into their midst as they rushed to the cache, slaying his companion and throwing Galan off a cliff.</p>
<p>Later, while wandering the forest in hunger, he came across a mushroom farmer; he was so hungry that he reached for the mushrooms before realizing they belonged to someone. The farmer briefly tried to fight but found himself far overmatched, then mistook mistook him for the new human armathor, and worried about offense, offered him all he carried. After seeing him slay a stirge without even looking, the farmer became convinced of his puissance, and yielded his packed lunch. Though puzzled, he was too hungry to refuse.</p>
<p>He returned to the city in 261 DR carrying a wealth of stolen dwarven gems in his boots; he was mistaken for a human by a patrol on the road, though he tried not to get spotted. Learning humans and dwarves were allowed in the city vexed him somewhat, but he still gave away a ruby to the armathor in charge, mostly as mockery- regretting the loss of a ruby almost instantly. Later he saw many elves flying under the power of the mythal ; he thought to attempt to burgle a home or two while they were distracted, but he was stopped by Symrustar Auglamyr , who kissed him and enspelled all his gems to fly off his boots.</p>
<p>At the time of the laying of the mythal , he was the last of his line and used to disappear for months on end. However, by 651 DR , he had married a human woman who bore him a son, Thallan Goadulphyn . He had since set himself to the task of restoring his house.</p>
