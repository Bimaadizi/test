<p>Hasmet Hudd was a gold dwarf commoner, displaced by The Absolute , and as a refugee, he sought shelter in Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hasmet was a gruff-looking, fair-skinned gold dwarf with a stubbly beard and curly light hair. He wore a simple blue jerkin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , an army assembled by the Cult of the Absolute moved from the Moonrise Towers in Chionthar Valley to menace the city of Baldur's Gate , displacing countless refugees in the process along the way. Hasmet Hudd and his brother Giftu Hudd found their way to the city walls and were allowed to enter the Lower City , unlike many other refugees who were refused entrance due to lack of coin or paperwork. Giftu was happy to be protected by the city walls, confident they could withstand the Absolutist siege, but Hasmet thought that Baldur's Gate simply was not secure enough to withstand the Absolutist strike, thinking they should've continued moving even further out of the Absolute's way.</p>
