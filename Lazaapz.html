<p>Lazaapz was a goblin artificer from the world of Eberron .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She was a mechanical genius of no small intellect, and her skills were highly sought after on her home world.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lazaapz wore a custom-built suit of power armor , featuring a spiked and visored helm, an adamantine tower shield , a mechanical grappling buzzsaw, and a "thunder gauntlet". The armor was powered by a crystal that needed to be replaced occasionally lest it explode. The crystal could also launch bolts of lightning at enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was born with only one arm, and her first invention was a mechanical replacement arm. Her engineering skills soon elevated her from her humble beginnings in The Cogs district of Sharn 's Lower City to the relatively more prestigious Tradefair district. Lazaapz was hired by the dragonmarked houses on several occasions, and came to lead a research team of elite engineers.</p>
<p>House Cannith discreetly hired Lazaapz to investigate an eldritch machine built by the Cul'sir Dominion for an unknown purpose. Lazaapz discovered the eldritch machine had markings associated with Dal Quor . Shortly thereafter, both Lazaapz and the device disappeared from Eberron. Lazaapz found herself transported to the world of Toril .</p>
