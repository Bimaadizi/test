<p>Bidderdoo Harpell was a wizard from the Harpell family, an eccentric clan of mages from Longsaddle that lived in the Ivy Mansion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For seven years, Bidderdoo was trapped in the form of a dog due to a backfired spell. During the Time of Troubles , the family (or he himself ) later found a way to turn him back to human form but during the war between Mithral Hall and Menzoberranzan in 1358 DR , he had defensive animal urges that eventually took over, turning him into a silver werewolf . Upon his first true transformation into a werewolf, he killed Uthegental Armgo , saving Thibbledorf Pwent and the remaining forces of the Gutbuster Brigade .</p>
<h2>Bidderdoos</h2>
<p>Bidderdoo's "legacy" was a number of werewolves that lived around the town of Longsaddle by 1479 DR , unintentionally scaring the townsfolk but in fact guarding the town. These werewolves were known as "the Bidderdoos." Whether they are descendants of Bidderdoo by blood or by curse was unknown.</p>
