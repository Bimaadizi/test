<p>Three-Dragon Ante was a card game played in many taverns across Faer√ªn , including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR . Played across all levels of society, the game was sometimes called copper dragons or three-copper when played by peasants, as well as golds or plats when played by adventurers and aristocrats.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The dedicated deck of Three-Dragon Ante consisted of one hundred cards. Of those, seventy were standard dragon cards, divided in ten suits of seven cards, each representing one type of chromatic or metallic dragon . The remaining thirty cards depicted other types of creatures, which included stronger Legendary dragon cards like the two draconic deities Bahamut and Tiamat , and non-draconic creatures, collectively called "mortals" in the game. The many existing variants of the game mainly differed in the choice of those additional cards.</p>
<p>At the beginning of play the dealer must separate the 70 suit cards from the 15 Legendary Dragon and 15 Mortal cards. The 30 special cards are then shuffled and 10 cards are drawn . Then the 70 suit cards and the 10 special cards are shuffled together. Each player draws a hand of 6 cards (during play they can hold a maximum of 10 cards).</p>
<p>The game consisted of rounds called "gambits" that involved betting and building sets of cards that competed with one another. The first phase of the gambit was a round of betting, or "ante", when players placed bets determined by random card draws on the stakes at the center of the table. It then proceeded to the second phase, when players took turns in placing cards in front of them to form "flights". At the end of three rounds, the player with the strongest flight collected the stakes. In addition, certain cards granted special moves whose effects could shape a single play or the dynamics of the entire gambit.</p>
<p>"Flights" are a set of three cards. "Color Flights" are grouped by the same dragon color suit (like three Gold Dragon cards). "Strength Flights" are grouped by the same card value (like three Dragon cards of different color suits worth "5"). A "Fellowship" is a group of three Mortal cards.</p>
