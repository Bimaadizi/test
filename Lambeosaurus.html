<p>A lambeosaurus ( pronounced : / l ɑː m b i oʊ ˈ s ɑːr ʌ s / lam-bee-o-SAR-us ), also known as duck bill among denizens of the Malatran Plateau , was a species of dinosaur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The lambeosaurus looked like other hadrosaurs. Its main distinguishing feature was the two crests on its head. A crest of solid bone rose up from the back of the head, and a hollow crest was found on their snout.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lambeosaurs' main form of defense from predators was to simply outrun them. Otherwise, when a predator was detected, the lambeosaurus would conceal itself, ideally in a swamp or marshy area.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lambeosaurs possessed excellent senses of hearing, sight and smell. This allowed them to detect the presence of a predator before it was directly threatened.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Lambeosaurs were herbivores and lived together in herds. They had powerful teeth that allowed them to consume almost any vegetation.</p>
