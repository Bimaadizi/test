<p>Dlathilvaer , or The Prow in the Sunset , was a small secluded forest island off the coast of Evermeet in the Trackless Sea .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The island of Dlathilvaer was an isolated island with a high peak and thick forest. The Prow in the Sunset laid within the territories that belonged to the elves of Evermeet and, despite lacking civilization, was defended.</p>
<p>Notably, the forest was connected to the 13 Gates of Magic of Nonthal . The third trap portal along Nonthal's Path that protected the mysterious Nonthal's Hold dropped unwitting adventurers on the isle of Dlathilvaer. The gate was one-way only.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The only notable creatures found on Dlathilvaer were kholiathra , moon-horses , and elven outcasts . The elves on the island were powerful but too violent, too evil, or rabid to live in the elven society of Evermeet.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Many stories told about the Prow in the Sunset claimed that periodically, mysterious magical gates opened up in different island spots. The gates were three long before the first elves settled Evermeet. The portals opened for brief moments, and their destinations were a mystery. Some old tomes of lore found in the dusty shelves of Candlekeep claimed that these portal led to other worlds.</p>
