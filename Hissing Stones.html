<p>The Hissing Stones bathhouse was an amenity and local landmark of Baldur's Gate , being one of the oldest buildings in the city as of the late 15 th century DR . The establishment had a sterling reputation as the city's safest and most confidential meeting area among the various Baldurian power groups.</p>
<p>It was owned and operated by Merilyn Allaryr , a moon elf with enough experience and acumen to effectively manage the various personalities and political groups that patronized her establishment. She paid her staff well enough that they were largely insusceptible to bribery.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The bathhouse featured a central cloister of cold lounging pools with steam rooms in the western wing and hot baths available in the eastern wing.</p>
<p>The bathhouse was decorated in the same architectural style as buildings from the Old Empire confederation of city-states of Chessenta , with hypocaust flooring and walls decorated by beautiful mosaics made of tile.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Discretion and neutrality were the greatest services provided by the staff of the Hissing Stones. The bathhouse was often selected as a venue to engage in negotiation that, if engaged in at any other location, would likely prove to be hostile.</p>
