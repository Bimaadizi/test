<p>Many Talons were enchanted shuriken from Kara-Tur , created by a possessing evil known only as the Calling .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each of the Many Talons possessed a +1 enchantment and magically sapped life energy from their targets, transferring it to the wielder. This vampiric regeneration was accompanied by magic that made Many Talons deadly to creatures venerating powers of good.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many Talons were born in the eastern land of Kara-Tur 200 years before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . An unknowable evil only known as The Calling targeted the Azaki assassins' guild of Kara-Tur and corrupted a minor attendant of the organization. In exchange for service to the Calling, the corrupted attendant's family was elevated to power. Now possessed, the attendant sowed chaos across the land. The corrupted body generated seemingly endless Many Talons out of their body before being slain by a sohei whose name was lost to history.</p>
<p>By the 14 th century DR , Many Talons showed up in various locations across Faer√ªn , including the city of Neverwinter and in stock of Okuzo's Imports store in Westgate .</p>
