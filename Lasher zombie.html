<p>Lasher zombie was a colloquial term for a variety of zombie that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering . They were created by necromancers from the corpses of those that had died of starvation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These undead were physically distinct from other zombies in that they had emaciated frames, with withered flesh that stretched taut over their brittle bones. The lower half of their torsos were opened and had writhing, pulsating intestines hanging out of it that swayed like snakes . At the end of each intestine was a snapping, tooth-filled maw.</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>Like other zombies they were resistant to harm from necrotic energy , but vulnerable to radiant energy .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lasher zombies were close-quarters combatants with a greater reach than the average zombie due to their weaponized intestines. They could use their intestines to ensnare opponents and pull them closer, then allow the entrails to maw at the victim. They would only abandon ensnared targets if an even weaker victim caught their attention. And like other zombies, lashers continued fought their enemies to the point of self-destruction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the late 15 th century DR , a human necromancer from the Bleak Academy was operating in Tymanther , in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke . Deep within a mausoleum at the burial site, the necromancer created a number of undead through use of the spell undead servitor . One of these undead was a lasher zombie, which confronted a group of adventurers in the graveyard outside the tomb when they came to rescue the missing dwarf Melnar .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Some necromancers went out of their way to kidnap people and let them starve to death so they could be reanimated as lasher zombies.</p>
