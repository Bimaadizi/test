<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Isryl was a servant at the Dunseltree's home. After Namra Dunseltree, the housewife, was replaced by a drow , her impersonator took to physically abusing her servants; one evening, said drow injured her grievously. She was nursed back to health by Qilué Veladorn , who fed her three potions of healing and gave her over to a Harper agent, who judged her condition disgraceful. Veladorn then impersonated her to get close to Namra Dunseltree.</p>
<h3>Impersonation</h3>
<p>Later, Veladorn acted like an overly cheerful Isryl to draw Namra's ire and get close to her. When Namra dropped her guard, Qilué broke her magical guise, knocked her out, spirited away her body with magic, and disguised herself as Namra. She then claimed to the house's servants that Isryl had thrown the plate of drinks she was carrying on her and fled the house.</p>
