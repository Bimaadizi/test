<p>The Fellowship of Innkeepers was one of the oldest guilds of Waterdeep . The collective of innkeepers and owners banded together to share information for their mutual protection, typically warning one another of problematic clientele such as thieves , rowdy patrons, or troublesome wizards .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The fellowship collectively bargained for products they all used, such as drink, linens, and laundering services, to acquire them at a discount for their respective establishments. They also shared their funds to hire a band of well-armed guards whose services would otherwise be well beyond their budgets.</p>
<p>Every nine nights, the guildmaster opened up Fellowship Hall for its members, so they could enjoy the luxuries of staying in a quality inn for a change.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Entrance into the fellowship had to be approved by a majority of the existing guild members and cost 25 gp . Annual dues were 20 gp.</p>
