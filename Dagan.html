<p>Dagan, son of Belgin , blood of Jangarak , was the last High Old One of Dumathoin , final ruler, and Aurgloroasa 's instrument of desctruction of the lost dwarven kingdom of Thunderholme .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Due to Aurgloroasa's influence, Dagan grew ever more ambitious and mad in his later years. He became increasingly demanding as the construction of the Necropolis of the Wyrm neared completion, and would continue to bark orders at his underlings even in undeath.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Even in undeath, Dagan carried a dwarven thrower smithed in Thunderholme's Thunderforge . In addition to the powers common to any throwing hammer of its type, magical lightning coursed through Dagan's mallet , and would occasionally discharge in large surges of destructive electricity.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Starting in Year of the Awakening, 1001 DR , Dagan began receiving communications from Aurgloroasa, pushing him into a series of decisions that would land him in a high political position within Thunderholme. When both King Emerlin III and his son died by the machinations of Dagan's draconic patron in the Year of Bane's Brood, 1034 DR , who he took to calling the "Sibilant Shade", he was swiftly crowned Regent of Thunderholme in the absence of a more obvious successor to the throne. Some months after his ascension, Dagan began work on a grand temple to Dumathoin.</p>
<p>Upon the temple's completion in the Year of Tolling Terrors, 1054 DR , Dagan dedicated the temple, now named the Necropolis of the Wyrm, to Null instead of the expected Dumathoin in a grand ceremony attended by the city's entire dwarven population. After this shocking proclamation, he summoned Aurgloroasa as an avatar of the Deathwyrm, who proceeded to extinguish all life in the city within a tenday.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Dagan had been turned into a death knight in the service of Aurgloroasa. He was put in command of a number of skeletons raised from his fellow former citizens of Thunderholme, and even symbolically retook his title as Regent of the city.</p>
