<p>The Vale of the Dragon Oracle was a valley on Mount Drakkor Rouge .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the valley was flooded with a shallow swamp. Recent volcanic activity, caused by a small change in the magma pressure, had caused a rockslide and collapsed parts of some buildings by 1370 DR , and the valley was covered in scrub instead of a swamp.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Starting in 1369 DR , the Cult of the Dragon built a new temple into a north-facing slope of the Vale, opposite the Temple of the Dragon Oracle , with help from the Church of Velsharoon , after their old temple was damaged in the rockslide at some point after 1358 DR .</p>
