<p>Redspawn arcanisses were a species of dragonspawn that wielded potent and destructive fire magics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses were largely humanoid in form, and stood some 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kilograms) as adults. They were covered in red scales with flame-like yellow and oranges markings. These markings were lighter and more extensive on hatchlings, but darkened to red as they matured, eventually becoming a near-black red shade.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses reveled in pain and destruction. They were fanatically devoted to Tiamat and believed that every destructive act they did should honor her.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like many other dragonblood creatures, redspawn arcanisses possessed both low-light vision and darkvision . They could not be paralyzed or forced asleep by magic, and like other redspawn, they were unharmed by fire and high heat. However, they were vulnerable to low temperatures.</p>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses were natural sorcerers with a strong predilection for fire spells. They could cast acid splash , detect magic , ghost sound , message , ray of frost , and touch of fatigue each six times per day; burning hands , magic missile , chill touch , and true strike each seven times per day; Melf's acid arrow and scorching ray each six times per day, and fireball four times per day. Additionally, their affinity for fire magic meant that each time they cast a fire spell, the energy rejuvenated them slightly.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses enjoyed combat and had a tendency to charge directly into melee, using fire spells recklessly and relying on their affinity to stay alive. If their fiery magic proved ineffective, they'd retreat, only to return later with other dragonspawn in search of revenge. Unlike many mages, redspawn arcanisses were capable of wearing light armor and carrying a light shield without risk of it interfering with their sorcery, though they always kept one hand free for spellcasting. They often carried a simple weapon, typically a light mace, in case melee became necessary.</p>
<p>If arcanisses spotted a servant of or creature associated with good dragons, they prioritized killing that foe before all others, even in the face of dire opposition.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses were created by Tiamat as combat spellcasters, and like all of Tiamat's dragonspawn, they were fanatically religious. They believed that they were her favored spawn, that they'd been mandated to torch the land and cleanse it of all non-dragonkind, and that they would rule over the rest of dragonkind after this cleansing was accomplished. They were guided in these matters by their holy book, the Scrolls of Fire , which they believed had been written by Tiamat herself.</p>
<p>On a day to day basis, however, arcanisses seemed far less than such a claimed destiny would suggest. They lived in small, nomadic bands of two to six individuals, never staying in one place for too long, nor gathering in large groups too often, to avoid growing dependent on others. When two groups of arcanisses met, they mingled freely and shared news, before splitting into new groups. Occasionally, multiple bands would work together to defeat a common foe but more often the most numerous band would take up that task and send the others away.</p>
<p>Arcanisses lived rough, and because of their nomadic ways, they rarely made any lasting impact on a given area, though they sometimes caused forest fires as they traveled. They were known to train to further their abilities as sorcerers.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses were carnivorous creatures who preferred their meat fresh and well-roasted. They typically lived in warm hills, making temporary lairs in large caves. They had a strong hoarding instinct, but did not take more treasure than they could carry. As arcanisses did not make items, nearly all of their hoard and equipment was stolen, or traded for from other, more settled dragonspawn. They preferred finer-quality items, especially ones with a draconic theme, and favored jewelry and art objects for their hoard.</p>
<p>Female arcanisses were fertile for one week each year, and laid only a single egg one month after mating. Females preferred to lay their eggs in naturally warm sites such as hot springs, volcanic vents, or even just a well-tended fire pit. Eggs hatched approximately after two weeks of incubating; hatchling arcanisses were adult-sized and capable of speech and spellcasting, but brighter in color. The adults of their band gave the hatchlings a week, maybe two, of instruction both religious and practical. After that, the hatchlings and adults split into new groups and left.</p>
<p>Redspawn arcanisses, along with redspawn firebelchers , were rumored to live in the Greypeak Mountains .</p>
