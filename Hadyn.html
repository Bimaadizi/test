<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hadyn had once been part of an adventuring party, but they had died during the pilgrimage to Ormpetarr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hadyn arrived at Ormpetarr at some point in 1396 DR , after a trip that took the better part of a year, starting from Waterdeep; the trip took him across the Greenfields , where most of his party died to gnolls , leaving him the sole survivor. He joined two other spellscar pilgrims, Finara and Raidon Kane , and entered the Plaguewrought Lands . There, trying to stick to the Pilgrim's Path , they took a bridge to make their way past the Granite Vortex ; he was almost thrown off the bridge and finally struck by blue fire. The fire appeared to make him briefly stronger, but he disintegrated within a few seconds.</p>
