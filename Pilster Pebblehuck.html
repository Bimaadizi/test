<p>Pilster Pebblehuck was a halfling baker in Elturel in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>He and his wife Merrywile had three children.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the whole city of Elturel was transported to Avernus , first layer of the Nine Hells , in the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , Pilster and his family hid in their bakery's basement. When their food started to run out, Pilster ventured into the streets to look for supplies, but was discovered in an alleyway by an imp . But Perchillux offered Pilster a deal: enough food for a month in exchange for his very soul. Desperate, Pilster considered signing the convoluted contract printed on parchment made from halfling skin. Adventurers might have intervened then, possibly determining the contract to be a trap that would have given Perchillux not just Pilster's soul, but those of all his family, and slaying or scaring the imp off.</p>
