<p>Umi was a tiefling child from Elturel that was forced to live as a refugee with others of his kind for some time during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the city of Elturel was dragged down to the Nine Hells in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city's tieflings were blamed for the disaster and subsequently exiled. Umi was among a group of them led by the Hellrider Zevlor , that ventured west across the Risen Road towards Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>After being attacked by goblins , the Elturian tieflings were given shelter at the Emerald Grove by the benevolent druid Halsin . While living in the cave system at the grove's entrance, Asharak set to teach the tiefling children some basics about how to defend themselves if threatened while on the road. Umi was rather excitable and not quite as focused as some of the other children.</p>
