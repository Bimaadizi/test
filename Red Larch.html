<p>The town of Red Larch was a waystop on the Long Road seven days north of Waterdeep , and was located at the intersection of three trails. One trail led to the Bargewright Inn , another to Kheldell , and the third ran into the hills to derelict, monster-infested keeps. The town was named for a stand of red larch trees that were chopped down about the time of the town's founding.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located atop a low ridge along the western edge of the Dessarin Valley .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Red Larch was known for its nourishing, though otherwise non-noteworthy food, called crumblecake . Crumblecakes were made into moist loaves from nuts, chickpea mash, chopped roots and greens, turkey and wildfowl scraps, all baked together.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , the town had a militia of around 100 skilled archers, mostly younger boys, who trained by keeping predators away from the poultry farm, Mhandyvver's Poultry . This led raiding parties amongst the orcs to avoid the town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town was named after a small forest stand of red larches that extended along the ridge. The trees, however, were felled by the first settlers in the region, who chose that particular location thanks to a natural water spring that fed into a small pond that could serve as drinking water for burden animals.</p>
