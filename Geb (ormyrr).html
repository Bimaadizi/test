<p>Geb was an ormyrr of the Sharpstick clan who resided in the ruined city of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Geb was a peaceful ormyrr, even though he could protect himself. His speech patterns in Common were sprinkled with words and concepts of some other language, presumably the mysterious language of his people. These words included: "hulu", "grebbo", and "hoi".</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Geb was in possession of a wand of cone of cold (a variety of wand of frost ), that appeared to be an non-melting magically enchanted icicle.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Geb was a part of the Sharpstick clan, which made a home in the Deep Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons. Geb was friends with Retha , a trader ormyrr of the same clan. The Sharpstick clan was conflicting with a group of orcs over territory; the conflict was resolved with the help of the heroes from Phlan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Geb, being obsessed with magic items like so many of his people, went on a search for one particular piece of enchantment and eventually got lost in the expansive complex that was the Dwarven Dungeons ' Main Halls. Eventually, the ormyrr was rescued by the group of heroes from Phlan that came to oppose the Cult of the Dragon what was corrupting the ruined city's mythal . Thankful for the heroes not attacking the alien-looking creature, Geb gifted them with his wand of cone of cold , before heading out back to the Deep Halls where his clan resided.</p>
