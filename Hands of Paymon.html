<p>The Hands of Paymon was a set of gloves that contained a bound demon . The rogue Gage took them from the wizard and demon -binder Tenambulum on 1374 DR , and wore them until 1375 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Though nondescript, those gauntlets were warm to the touch, almost hot. The right glove bore a mouth with a too-sinuous tongue, dripping with venom and leading to a bottomless darkness on its palm, while the left glove had an eye on the back of the hand.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The right glove allowed its wielder to teleport across walls. Its mouth could also be used to clutch on to surfaces with its teeth, though making it let go was not so simple. The mouth could also find purchase in immaterial souls, allowing it to devour phantasmal undead. It was also capable of tracking, sniffing out corpses and of emmitting a dangerous, keening wail capable of disabling even a knight in full armor.</p>
<p>The left glove was an aid while searching for secret doors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gage had acquired the glove while sacking the tower of the wizard Tenambulum , looking for a tome, Glyphs and Griffons , on 1374 DR , a year before 1375 DR . He carried them until 1375 DR , when his left glove was destroyed by contact with Angul , and his right glove was later destroyed in an alchemical explosion, releasing the demon bound within.</p>
