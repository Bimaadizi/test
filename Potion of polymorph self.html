<p>A potion of polymorph self was an enchanted potion that replicated the effects of the polymorph self spell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Potions of polymorph self were bottled in small glass vials and shimmered with multiple scintillating colors of the magical liquid.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The imbiber of this potion could change their form into that of any corporeal creature. The rough size range of possible creatures was as small as a bird to as large as a hippopotamus . The imbiber gained the form of locomotion and breathing of the selected creature, but not any other natural, special or magical abilities. Any equipment worn by the imbiber was melded into their new form. The imbiber's intelligence remained the same so spellcasting was still viable assuming the new form allowed for it.</p>
