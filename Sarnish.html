<p>Sarnish was an apprentice necromancer in the service of House Szind during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sarnish had long, straight white hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sarnish was loyal first to priestess Silan Szind , who sought to kill and replace her mother Matron Zhivsha Szind . Sarnish shared this plot with the house's head necromancer Relig , who believed that he could flawlessly reanimate the Matron and keep her around as an undead puppet. Unfortunately for everyone involved, a team from Cormyr arrived in the estate and overheard the conspiracy. Politically-conscious heroes may have then reported the scheme to Matron Zhivsha, who would be pleased enough to let the invaders leave. In that case, Silan would be slain and reanimated as a zombie , and Sarnish left to "bodyguard" his lady.</p>
