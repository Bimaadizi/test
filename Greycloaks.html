<p>The Greycloaks were an elven organization based in Evereska for at least 250 years, from the 13 th to the late 15 th centuries DR . They were likely associated with the Greycloak Hills , which encircled and protected the elven fortress home. [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Frozen Flower, 1221 DR , the Greycloaks forged a magical broadsword ; such heavy blades were a rare sight among the elves, so it was quite unusual. It came to be wielded by Erevain Blacksheaf , an elf adventurer who traveled to Icewind Dale and died there in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
<p>When the iron crisis afflicted the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Greycloaks sent their agent Xan to investigate the situation.</p>
