<p>Oil of bane was a type of magic oil that temporarily rendered the target of its application unlucky and clumsy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The substance's sweet scent left a feeling of foolishness, ill-preparedness, and unworthy in those who inhaled it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Oil of bane was used to coat weapons as those who received a successful strike from such weapons fell under the effects similar to that of the bane spell . Similar effects could be achieved by throwing an oil of bane vial at an opponent.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>One of the recipes to create oil of bane required alchemical vitriol of putrefied tumor extracted from the creatures killed by the darkness in the Shadow-cursed Lands of Western Heartlands . The vitriol then needed to be combined with a certain type of an alchemical sublimate.</p>
