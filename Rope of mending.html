<p>Rope of mending was a magical rope .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A rope of mending looked like a regular rope made of hemp. It was sold in coils of 50 feet (15 meters). If the rope was cut into smaller lengths, it could be mended by uttering a special command word. The shortened lengths had to be in contact with one another and not in use for the mending to be successful. If a shortened length was lost, the total length of a rope of mending was shortened by the length of the piece that was lost.</p>
