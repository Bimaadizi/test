<p>Zorah was the wife of Vladek , the owner of the Sloop in Mulsantir in Rashemen during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zorah was a tall and muscled half-orcish woman even among her kin. She had a facial tattoo adorning her forehead. She had a stoic and intimidating face that softened every time her eyes laid on Vladek.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Zorah and her human husband, the innkeeper named Vladek, bought the Sloop. They turned what used to be an unprofitable glorified museum into a tavern and an inn. Zorah manned the establishment's doors, ensuring there was no trouble and handled rowdy drunks, while Vladek handled the bar.</p>
