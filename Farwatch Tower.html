<p>Farwatch Tower was one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeep 's Trollwall , located in the city's North Ward .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This tower was located at the end of Tower March , just north of Watch Alley . Beneath the tower was one of the deep wells from which the city obtained its fresh, clean water.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Farwatch Tower stood five stories tall and was directly connected to the Trollwall that bounded the city and separated North Ward from the Field Ward .</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>Being a torchtower, Farwatch Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.</p>
<p>Behind an open doorway in the tower's southeastern wall, was a tall yet tiny bare sentry post with walls several feet thick, that was regularly monitored by the City Watch . This was because the sentry post was both haunted and contained a secret portal to Maldiglasâ€™s Refuge . Despite their best efforts, it was often utilized by conspirators, lovers, and beggars seeking shelter.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Farwatch Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch.</p>
