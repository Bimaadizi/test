<p>Evani was a famous traveling artificer and musician from Waterdeep , who made a tour stop in Liam's Hold in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Evani was an eccentric woman who draped herself in dazzling, brightly and chaotically-colored clothes. She wore face-coverings and only had her eyes and intensely focused eyebrows exposed.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Evani's musical instrument was the Fantabuliser , a strange and intimidating device, created jointly with a person only known as Silhouette . Evani was also a proud owner of a curious and precocious cat .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR, Evani was convinced to perform at the Holdfast Inn - a venue along the Trade Way , popular among travelers and patrons of the arts. On the day of her arrival, Evani set up her machine on stage, tested it, and prepared to perform the following day. She ate a bowl of Nuli Barbarak 's famous soup , fresh bread , and soon after dinner, the musician collapsed of exhaustion. However, the next day, when the time came, she realized that the Fantabuliser had been sabotaged. The woman feverishly tried to fix the gadget but failed with the essential device component missing. She was terrified of embarrassing herself and gaining a reputation of being a failure. Sometime in her part, Evani crossed paths with a planewalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz , and they parted on bad terms. Coincidentally, Vejoni stopped just outside the village of Liam's Hold during the same time as Evani's performance was scheduled to commence. Even though Evani thought Vejoni felt jealous of her, she dismissed the thought that the wizard was the culprit.</p>
