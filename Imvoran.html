<p>Imvoran was a Zhentarim mageling of the mid-14 th century.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1357Â DR , Imvoran had been in service to the Zhentarim for a dozen years. Late that year, while in Manshoon's presence, he witnessed the spellfire -induced death of Drauthtar Inskirl , when the latter teleported to the High Lord's throne room, fatally injured by Shandril Shessair 's spellfire. That was the first time he saw fear in Manshoon's face.</p>
