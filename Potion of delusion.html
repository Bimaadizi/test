<p>Potions of delusion were potions that caused those who drank them to believe they had imbibed and gained the effects of any number of other magical potions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , one of the apprentice magic-users in Zhentil Keep failed in creating a potion and it resulted in a potion of delusion .</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , whenever the Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff was coerced into surrendering magical potions or gravely suspected that an adventurer requesting them would put them to misuse, they would instead gift potions of delusion or faulty potions of levitation .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Suggested special ingredients for such potions were the flesh of a doppelganger , the "ichor" or spiritual essence of a rakshasa , and in the case of Zakhara the blood of an al-jahar .</p>
<p>It was also said that there was a small chance that any failed attempt in brewing a potion would result in a potion of delusion .</p>
