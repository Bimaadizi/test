<p>Katriana Donohar was a Tethyrian human woman living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . She was a priest of Chauntea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was the daughter of the famed priest of Chauntea, Harandave Donohar , high priest of the Harvest Hall in Wheloon. She followed him into the priesthood and served as one of his assistant clerics by 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Following Harandave's death, Katriana took over from her father as head of the temple. She held the position by 1374 .</p>
<p>By Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Katriana met the priests of the new temple of Mystra in Wheloon, finding them polite but not particularly friendly. She put this down to big-city inter-temple rivalry. When adventurers revealed it to be a false temple and a front for followers of Shar and Cyric , Katriana would offer her healing spells for free.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Katriana Donohar was usually at the temple, managing affairs there. She had a large number of divine scrolls , dating back to Harandave's day, which she sold to those she believed would use them for good deeds. She had thirteen followers or attendants, all minor priests.</p>
