<p>The Brotherhood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death , often referred to as simply the Deathgrins , was an order of paladins dedicated to Osiris .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Deathgrins served as the militant branch of the church of Osiris , and sought out evil wherever it manifested within the Old Empires .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Brotherhood was founded following the Year of the Grisly Ghosts, 1183 DR , by paladins who had come together to destroy the town of Sekras , a city on the River of Swords in Mulhorand , that was the center of worship for the evil god Sebek and a haven for man-eating werecrocodiles . The paladins' assault on Sekras, which was tacitly endorsed also by the church of Horus-Re , was characterized by a take-no-prisoners strategy in which all suspected werecrocodiles were killed, even the very young and the very old. They successfully drove the Cult of Sebek underground and pushed much of the surviving werecrocodile population out of Mulhorand. The surviving paladins went on to found the Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Following the Time of Troubles in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the Brotherhood turned its attention to fighting the church of Tiamat in Unther , a mission which cost the lives of many of their members.</p>
