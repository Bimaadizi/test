<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to dockworkers, Captain Drauz the Dreg used deceit and managed to assume the role of harbormaster of the Blacklake district 's docks in Neverwinter. He was spotted flogging the dockworkers on multiple occasions, and there was a troubling incident where he took candy from a small child.</p>
<p>Circa Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Drauz was "put in his place" by a carpenter who was since called a "hero" among local dockworkers. Drauz then left the town.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Year of the Grinning Halfling, 1481 DR , his ship was docked at Pier 9 of the docks of the Blacklake district. By chance, he unexpectedly received several pleas from adventurers, among whom was the carpenter who had thrown a wrench in the captain's lfve, to be ferried to Stormwreck Isle aboard his ship on the same day. It's unknown how exactly the carpenter ultimately got to the isle; he may have saved Drauz's ship from a pirate, or he had simply stowed aboard the ship.</p>
