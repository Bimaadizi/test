<p>A helm of telepathy was a magical helm that enabled telepathic communication between the wearer and another creature. It was also capable of issuing limited telepathic commands.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of a helm of telepathy could cast the detect thoughts spell at will. While connected to another creature's mind via concentrating on the spell, the helm allowed two-way telepathic communication between the wearer and the connected creature.</p>
<p>Additionally, the helm of telepathy allowed for the wearer to cast the suggestion spell on a connected creature. This power could be used only once per day, as the helm recovered this ability at the next dawn.</p>
<p>Like most other items that allowed for distant communication, any conversation held through a helm of telepathy within the Nine Hells could be overheard by an archdevil .</p>
