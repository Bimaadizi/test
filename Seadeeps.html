<h2>Geography</h2>
<h3>Entrance</h3>

<h3>Exits</h3>
<p>Several locations exited from Seadeeps:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Seadeeps was originally the site of two of Clan Melairkyn 's main mining efforts. Its caverns were excavated by following the veins of mithral that extended westward under the floor of the Sea of Swords .</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , an illithid colony was established in Seadeeps, led by a ulitharid called Extremiton . The group had fled its main colony after a githyanki attack on the main colony deep in the Underdark , following the instructions of its elder brain . Despite the relative security provided by the dungeon, the colony was under threat of extermination by the githyanki group living in the Crystal Labyrinth .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Extremiton and its mind flayer colony had plans to conquer Waterdeep. However, the city's vast population had made the ulitharid extremely curious. In order to better understand them, it built a series of psipods in the level, devices that could imprison sentient creatures in a dream version of Waterdeep called Alterdeep , crafted from information gathered telepathically from Waterdhavians' minds. The ulitharid then manifested itself in the illusion as any character it wished, although it showed a preference to appear as Durnan .</p>
<p>At the same time, a githyanki strike force, commanded by the knight Yaveklar , slowly opposed the mind flayers while awaiting reinforcements from the Crystal Labyrinth to conduct a final assault. In order to oppose the githyanki, the mind flayers bred a neothelid , which they planned to unleash upon them on both levels.</p>
<p>Additionally, a cloister of flumphs inhabited a tall cavern on the outskirts of the level, feeding off the mind flayers' and githyanki's psionic energy from a safe distance. The githyanki slaughtered any flumphs they encountered on sight.</p>
