<p>Lutecia Hhune was a matron of the mercantile Hhune family of Baldur's Gate , who lived in the city during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lutecia had little in the way of family in her golden years. With a deceased husband and no children of her own, the only family she knew was a few siblings to whom she did not speak.</p>
<p>She was well-served by her personal valet Kaddrus , a cambion that took the visage of a particularly attractive younger man. She believed him to be quite capable in carrying out her wants and orders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early 1490s DR , Lutecia sought out scholars at High Hall in order to track down family members who she would find more amenable to being heir to her family's city estate.</p>
<p>When the Shield of the Hidden Lord was stolen from the family crypts, in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lady Lutecia tasked Kaddrus and his lackeys with its retrieval.</p>
