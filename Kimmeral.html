<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kimmeral was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the Western Heartlands . He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers – the fortress controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General Ketheric Thorm . Kimmeral shared his quarters with Mig , a cultist ogress who was convinced she was hearing sounds of meat moving in the Towers' walls. Kimmeral looked down on the dimwitted ogre and lamented having to share quarters with her. According to some, Kimmeral may had been slain during the True Soul heroes and Harper attack on the Moonrise Towers that ended Ketheric Thorm's undead existence.</p>
