<p>Marlikkon was a fruit-bearing thorny bush found in abundance in the Heartlands of Faer√ªn , in the vicinity of Starmantle and to the southwest of Evereska .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marlikkon was a wild bush, not cultivated but commonly gathered and consumed by humanoids . The fruit was easily identifiable for its thorny hard outer shell, similar to that of chestnuts . They were brown in color and had easily opened, irregularly seamed shells. Marlikkon's citrus flesh was shaped in purplish-gray translucent ovals. The fruit was acidic and sweet, reminiscent of tangerine .</p>
<p>Once shelled, the fruit withered and dried out swiftly, usually within just a couple of days. However, if left whole, the shell preserved the fruit for a very long time. Oftentimes, unshelled marlikkon was stored in sacks or barrels in food cellars, lasting for over a year.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>Marlikkon was usually eaten raw. The fruit was piled in a dish and served with a nutcracker or a wood mallet to open the hard shells.</p>
<p>The outer shell could be boiled to create a mahogany-colored dye, while the needles from the fruit could be used as crude sewing needles. The prickly shell was also used decoratively in various fanciful ornate desserts fit for nobility.</p>
