<p>Isarr Kronenstrom , also known as the Wolf King , was a Malarite chieftain who led a clan of Tribe of the Wolf barbarians in Icewind Dale during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Chief Kronenstrom was a vicious and brutal man who inspired fear in all the folks across the dale.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He had an exceptional sense of hearing and smell. Whenever he attacked a foe who had spilt blood, Kronenstrom went into a complete frenzy.</p>
<p>Fitting to his name, the chieftain would let out howls to communicate with his allied tribesmen.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He wielded a sickle and a heavy crossbow in battle.</p>

<p>While the Wolf King only garnered support from a small number of Wolf Tribe barbarians, his followers were particularly loyal and ferocious. Other chieftains believed themselves too weak to challenge his rule.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , Chieftain Kronenstrom led the assault on a camp of his fellow Reghedmen barbarians, also of the Tribe of the Wolf. The only survivor was the son of the camp's chieftain, Aerix Vokototh .</p>
