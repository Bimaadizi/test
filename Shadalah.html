<p>Princess Shadalah was the bride of sheik Kassim Arslan 's son, Hassan Arslan . In the year 1356 DR , the efreeti Khalitharius kidnapped her because of the mark on her palm, caused by Martek 's magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the year 1356 DR , Shadalah, a young noblewoman from the tribe dwelling in the Oasis of the White Palm, became the fiancee to Hassan Arslan after she manifested a mark on her palm. Not long after, the efreeti Khalitharius was released; one of the first things he did was to contact the dervish cleric Corga Kazan of the Oasis of the White Palm , trying to have him find and capture a woman with a mark on her palm. The dervish knew that the princess had manifested such a mark, but he did not relay this to the efreeti. Eventually, the dervish arranged for the princess' kidnapping by hiring a slaver ring to carry out the deed; before it could take place, the efreeti learned the identity of the woman with the palm mark, and kidnapped her himself just before the assasssin sent for that purpose did it, three days after the announcement of their marriage.</p>
<p>One week after her disappearance, the adventurers responsible for the release of the efreeti arrived at the Oasis of the White Palm. The sheik, Kassim Arslan , hired them to find out the whereabouts of the princess, and retrieve her. The sheik's youngest son, Korus Eikoth , would instead try and convince these adventurers that the princess was still in the Oasis, and nudge them towards investigating the Sandvoyagers Guild , which he knew was at the time just a front for a slaver ring, and which he suspected was holding the princess expecting to renegotiate the payment expected from the dervish cult, of which Korus was secretly part.</p>
<p>The adventurers found the Temple of Set beneath the Oasis. There, they may have broken up the slaver ring or the dervish cult. A prisoner of the cult, Barus Broadblade, and a prisoner of the slavers, Tolnus Granicus , had independently arrived at the conclusion that the princess was actually held in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak . The adventurers may also have realized this by plotting the tracks of the Malatath 's attacks throughout the desert. Whatever their source, the adventurers came across Princess Shadalah and Khalitharius in the Crypt, where they drove off Khalitharius, maybe using one of the palm sign amulets from the Sheik, and seized the vessel in which the efreeti had captured her.</p>
<p>Freeing the princess, they used the amulet to extract a message from the mark on her palm. That message pointed them to Aeraldoth , a djinni vizier, as well as spell out the means to free him from his prison in the city of Phoenix .</p>
