<p>Hoch Miraz was a wizard from Calimshan in west Faerûn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1330 DR , Hoch Miraz was aboard the Golden Crown , a treasure galleon leaving the Calishite mining colony of Berranzo on the island of Gundarlun in the Trackless Sea . Struck by a storm, the Golden Crown sunk off the coast of the island, and Hoch Miraz went down with the vessel.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Hoch Miraz was said to possess a staff of the magi , a ring of spell turning , and a cube of force , though the latter was thought to have failed, to account for Hoch's doom. These were still thought to lay in the sunken ship in 1370 DR .</p>
