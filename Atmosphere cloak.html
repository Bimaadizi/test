<p>An atmosphere cloak , also known as a cloak of air pockets , was a seemingly ordinary garment that, when worn in wildspace , would double the size of its wearer's air envelope.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These cloaks would greatly increase the amount of time a person could travel outside of planetoids in wildspace, without the protection of a spelljamming ship . The hood of the cloak generated enough fresh air, even if the surrounding atmosphere was foul or unbreathable, for the wearer to breathe for anywhere from a few minutes to almost half an hour. While it did not filter the air from the outside, or remove any poisonous gases or particles, it did generate clean, refreshing air for the wearer, which protected them from poisonous gas while in Realmspace or while on Toril .</p>
