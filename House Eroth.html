<p>House Eroth was a silver elf house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1367 DR , House Eroth was led by the elders and siblings Tanithil Eroth and Anaharae Eroth . Before the Retreat , it was known for its rangers and scouts, but these services were far less important on Evermeet and many become woodsmen instead.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Eroth was a religious house, worshiping Angharradh , Corellon Larethian and Rillifane Rallathil . The house was noted for its members' views, which often conflicted with those of the elves as a whole. For example, they did not recognize the authority of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower over the elven people.</p>
<h2>Base of operations</h2>
<p>The house's estate consisted of small stone buildings in Leuthilspar connected by underground tunnels.</p>
