<p>Tithonnas was a great wyrm topaz dragon and a thane of the gem dragon god Sardior .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tithonnas and the other thanes normally resided within Sardior's Ruby Palace as part of his court, but on occasion would wander a world of the material plane alone. Creatures that earned his favor might be rewarded with gems , or sometimes some other gift or favor. He represented a certain facet of Sardior's personality.</p>
<p>On worlds where Sardior was worshiped, some 10% of later temples to him were dedicated to Tithonnas. At these temples, lesser in size and overlooked places, Tithonnas was revered by the faithful and served as the messenger and conduit of their faith. They attracted psions specializing in psychometabolism. There were also small shrines alongside major Sardioran churches in larger cities. Followers of Tithonnas were called Tithonnians.</p>
