<p>The Shrine of Crossed Swords was a shrine of Tempus that was founded in Scardale Town in 1362 DR .</p>
<p>After the second inter-dale war ended in 1356 DR , Scardale abruptly became home to an occupying force of soldiers from nations such as Cormyr and Sembia . The religious needs of the various garrisons were accommodated for by Battle Chaplain Ulara Axehaft , who founded the temple and helped it thrive where others had failed.</p>
