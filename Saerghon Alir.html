<p>Saerghon Alir , also known as Saerghon the Magnificent , was a wizard and the service-mage for the Aurora's Realms Shop, Singing Dolphin Catalogue Counter in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As his title attested, Saerghon the Magnificent was a pompous and arrogant man with many affected mannerisms and flourishes and who always made a grand entrance. He considered himself the greatest mage in Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>For all that, he was simply the service-mage at an outlet of Aurora's Emporium , usually only transporting goods via teleport spells from the central warehouse.</p>
<p>What's more, he apparently hadn't even opened, let alone read, all the books and scrolls he'd bought or obtained over much of his life, and though he was a wizard of some power, he had not mastered half the magic in his possession.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Instead, for his protection, he relied on a couple of enchanted rings: a ring of spell turning and a ring of spell storing , which contained Evard's black tentacles , feeblemind , fly , invisibility , and wizard eye . He wore many other shiny rings, all with gems , on all his fingers.</p>
