<p>When Cernd felt the call to serve nature and protect the land he left his wife behind and traveled across the realms. He spent some time with a grove in Cormyr , before joining one in Tethyr . From his perspective, they decided together than this action was best for the greater good. Unbeknownst to Cernd she was pregnant and within the next nine months, gave birth to a baby. While he was away, Galia became involved with a nobleman named Deril .</p>

The influence of Shadow Druids corrupted the once peaceful druid enclave creating conflict with the nearby town of Trademeet . While investigating the area Cernd was captured by the townsfolk and imprisoned.
