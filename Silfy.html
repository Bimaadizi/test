<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Elturel was pulled down into the Nine Hells for a brief party. The catastophe, which came to be known as the Descent , led to the mass-exodus of tieflings from the city, an action made against their will. The tieflings rallied under the leadership of Zevlor , a former member of the city's Hellriders . For a time, the Elturian tieflings were able to find temporary safe haven in the druidic stronghold of the Emerald Grove .</p>
