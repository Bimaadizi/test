<p>The Castle of Sorcery was the residence of the mage Ilhundyl until the Year of Many Mushrooms, 238 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The castle was in the Calishar .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The location included at least one room for meetings, with a throne room, and one that included a lectern and a crystal on which he conducted conversations with faraway individuals.</p>
<p>One of its rooms was called the Wind Cavern, which had a number of glass sculptures riddled with holes that made music of sorts when wind passed through them. The room had an archway leading to the northern tower of the castle, and this archway was flanked with suits of armor. This room was also close to the Great Gate of the castle.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A maze outside the gates held numerous traps, both magical and mechanical, many of which were illusionary walls and invisible portals. There were hungry lions that could be released to hunt down intruders, as well as guardian golems and trapped statues that shot lightning out of their hands. Some of the pit traps had to be powered manually by men on wheels. There were also archers, and some golems that were joined with the walls.</p>
<p>The Wind cavern in particular had panels that could reveal death tyrants , a hidden cage full of winged serpents , and numerous glyphs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilhundyl was banished from Volothamp in 223 DR , and had almost certainly gained his castle by then.</p>
<p>He received a visit from the Mystran priestess Elmara, secretly prince Elminster Aumar of Athalantar , in 232 DR , where she asked for his guidance in knowing magic; he bid her find Ondil's Book of Spells , which she acquired by 233 DR , yielding it up at Mystra's Dance in the mouth of the Delimbiyr River , where he then stole it without her knowledge. The prince came back without his disguise in 238 DR , attacking and slaying Ilhundyl with the help of the sorceress Myrjala Talithyn . Afterwards, she used spellfire to raze and torch much of the castle's insides.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Ilhundyl had numerous servants, one in particular being Garadic , a shapeshifting creature of sorts, and another being a female lich of unknown provenance that was enslaved to his will in some way.</p>
