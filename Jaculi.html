<p>Jaculis ( pronounced : / dʒ ɑː ˈ k uː l i z / jah-KOO-leez or : /ˈ dʒ æ k uː l i z / JÆK-oo-leez ) were agile, tree-dwelling creatures that resembled snakes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jaculis looked like snakes with mauve to dark purple scales and an arrow-shaped head topped with sharp, forward-pointing horns. Some members of this species displayed heads that were more broad and flat, with razor-edged horns projecting as a ridge on either side.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were not innately aggressive or hostile towards others, though they were very territorial and easily excitable.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Jaculis were capable of camouflaging themselves, comparable to the famed ability of a chameleon , changing the color of their skin to match their surroundings. They were also known to be talented climbers and swimmers. Some described them as being capable of launching themselves with a force and accuracy comparable to that of javelins .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Jaculis lured in their prey with animal trance , then attacked with its sharp horns and its ability to constrict. If a foe proved too troublesome, jaculis jumped from tree to tree to escape, then swung around and pursued the prey for a better opportunity.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Jaculis subsisted primarily on a diet of tree moss and insects.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Jaculis could live in nearly any environment, though being serpents they had a preference for warm climates. Furthermore, being arboreal creatures they were typically encountered in forests and jungles, though some were known to adapt to living within buildings that had many pillars.</p>
<p>In Interior Faerûn , jaculis could be found in the jungle within the Cathedral of Emerald Scales .</p>
<h2>Notable jaculi</h2>
<p>Moa , one of the Nine Trickster Gods of Chult, was a jaculi.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>Serphidians were able to shapechange into jaculi through use of their specially granted snake skin spell .</p>
