<p>Whaleships were large spelljammers designed for large amounts of bulk freight and passengers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whaleships were large, tall ships, with many enclosed decks and heavy, armored, blunt rams in their fronts. They strongly resembled the animal for which the whaleships were named. They were known for their size, not their elegance, and for being perfect haulers of massive amounts of bulk freight and passengers. While not intended for combat and having poor maneuverability, they had nonetheless proven effective in battle, mainly due to their devastating rams. Their greatest advantage were that they were fully enclosed ships.</p>
<p>Whaleships were used for hauling either people or equipment, with cargo haulers specializing in freight like cloth, grain, and other foodstuffs. Some were even modified so that an entire side of the hull could be detached for easier loading and unloading. Otherwise, all material had to be loaded through the ship's mouth. Passenger liners, like the Glass Whales with their glassteel windows, did a thriving business providing luxury cruises.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Several whaleships came and went through the Rock of Bral , both cargo haulers and passenger liners.</p>
