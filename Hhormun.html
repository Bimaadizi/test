<p>Hhormun was an elder member of the War Wizards of Cormyr , that served the Forest Kingdom during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was a rather portly man that could be quite energetic despite his old age.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the superior War Wizard to Caladnei for a time, before her ascent as Mage Royal of Cormyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the flying Netherese city of Thultanthar returned to the Realms, and quickly emerged as a threat to Cormyr and the rest of the Heartlands . In Mirtul of that year, Hhormun, Caladnei, and a band of Purple Dragons hid themselves amidst a tribe of Bedine nomads in order to uncover the location of the Shadovar city. During their journey, Hhormun gave just a bit too much leeway over planning to Sheikh Sa'ar of the Bait Mahwa , allowing the Bedine to capture resting veserabs owned by the Shadovar . This act of aggression drew the Shadovar into battle, forced them to call for reinforcements, and ultimately offered the Cormyreans the location of Thultanthar.</p>
<p>Rather than strike out at the flying city however, the Steel Regent Alusair Obarskyr staged the city of Tilverton for the inevitable battle between her people and the Shadovar army.</p>
