<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Tigers Curse, Malatran calendar, late 14 th century DR, the Wise Ones tribe became aware of an old foe resurfacing. The leader of evil spider katanga , the Mother of a Thousand Young, was ready to birth an army of thousand ravenous younglings. In preparation for the birthing, she initiated a ritual that sent deadly poisons into the rivers cascading off the Fire Mountain. Taru was stationed within the katanga's web room, alongside a katanga archer named Ramu . The room was draped in thick spiderwebs with desiccated bodies of small animals tangled up in them as well as immature spider katanga and ordinary spider young.</p>
<p>It was unknown if Taru survived the confrontation with a group of heroes of the Living Jungle when they infiltrated the katanga caves. However, it was likely Taru fought to the death as he feared nothing and venerated death.</p>
