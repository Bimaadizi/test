<p>The Red Worm was a half - red dragon half- remorhaz of enormous size who had been chosen to be a guardian of the portal in Choshein .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Red Worm had streaks of red running along his otherwise white body, indicative of his draconic heritage. Likewise, his head was a strange mixture of draconic and insectiod features; he bore both frills and horns.</p>
<p>The Red Worm was not a mindless monster; his draconic parentage gave him more intelligence than the typical remorhaz. He was fully capable of devising shrewd attacks, and he was smart enough to suspect that he was guarding a portal of some sort, though he did not know why.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to the abilities of a typical remorhaz, as a half-red dragon, the Red Worm could breath fire approximately once a day and was immune to fire, paralysis, and magical sleep effects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red Worm was the spawn of an eccentric female red dragon named Icindallix , whose eggs were fertilized by an especially large male remorhaz. She laired in the caverns where Choshein once stood.</p>
<p>The Red Worm eventually grew powerful enough to slay and consume his sire. He was then chosen by the Prince of Jhoth√ªn to guard the portal in Choshein.</p>
<p>Some time in the late 14 th century DR , the Shadovar sent an expedition to explore the ancient Netherese colony that once occupied Choshein's cavern. The Red Worm slew them all and left no survivors.</p>
<p>After this incident, however, the Red Worm grew nervous and would not leave the cave, even to hunt. Instead, he received a tribute of sorts of food from other remorhaz in the region.</p>
<p>It was likely that the Shadovar sent further expeditions to slay the Red Worm, but his ultimate fate is not recorded.</p>
