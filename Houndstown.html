<p>Houndstown was a small farming village in Faerûn that was menaced by the Skulking Dragon clan of kobolds sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Houndstown and other nearby farming communities started being regularly raided by the Skulking Dragons under the leadership of Sholsarrath the Lame , a kobold warlock , who recently took over the clan. Soon after the plunder began, the Skulking Dragons became hated and feared among the locals. The clan's infamy rose so much that a band of traveling adventurers decided to end the kobold menace.</p>
<p>The five adventurers rode out of the village of Houndstown and quickly were able to track the Skulking Dragon clan. The kobolds might have been a nightmare for the local peasantry, but they were naught but pests for weathered adventures, who slaughtered the clan's best warriors en masse. The dim-witted warlock, however, was not slain by the adventurers but by Yargulbuzul , his patron, after agreeing to pay for rescue with his own head.</p>
