<p>The iron phoenix was a unique guardian construct in the Tomb of Martek , protecting the Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism .</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Iron Phoenix had the ability to use a limited number of flame strikes and of sonic screams every day. If it was sufficiently damaged, it would collapse into the flaming pits within the room to regenerate within the day, much like a regular phoenix. It also had the ability to attack by pecking or clawing.</p>
<p>In 1356Â DR , the phoenix may have slain a number of guilders who attempted to enter its protected area. It was instructed to frighten, but never attack, anyone going through the middle of the room, however.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>A message from Martek around the entrance suggested that the iron phoenix was a monument to Phoenix.</p>
