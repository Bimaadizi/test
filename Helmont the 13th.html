<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Zhengyi the Witch-King completed his decade-long invasion of Damara in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , by slaying King Virdin Bloodfeathers at the Ford of Goliad , he and his allies set in motion a plan to wipe out the remaining ruling nobles and replace them with puppets. Helmont the 13th was the first of Damara's dukes to be assassinated, followed by fifty members of his family. This left Dashard Devlin, an ally of Zhengyi, as the only viable claimant to the ducal seat. Dashard was swiftly appointed as Duke Helmont the 14th, ushering in an era of propaganda and subjugation in Carmathan.</p>
