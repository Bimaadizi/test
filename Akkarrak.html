<p>In the 1374 DR , the Shattered Spear tribe discovered the shipwreck of the Vigilant on Omgar's Teeth . The vessel belonged to Sa'Sani of Samargol and her trade company. The Batiri attacked surviving sailors and passengers, including the infamous writer Volothamp Geddarm . Some of the survivors ended up captured by the goblins along with some of the ship's precious cargo. At the same time, another group of survivors was confronted by Ghzermag , Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, and Shoudul of the Skulls . Volo tried to persuade charming locals to let the survivors go, but Volo was not as fluent in Goblin language as he claimed to be. In the ensuing fight, Clawkeeper Kzheemoc, Akkarrak, and their kin were slain.</p>
