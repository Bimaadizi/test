<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1450 DR , Uadjit was chosen to be Mehen 's wife, but he spurned her because he had a relationship with his clanmate, Arjhani. When Mehen was exiled, Arjhani was chosen by Clan Verthisathurgiesh as the new husband for Uadjit.</p>

<p>Uadjit was Clan Kepeshkmolik's candidate for the elections to chose the new Vanquisher , that were expected to be celebrated in 1487 DR .
