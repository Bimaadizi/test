<p>A coracle was a type of boat used for fishing . It was sometimes also known as a currach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A coracle was made from a basic and lightweight frame, which could be made from wicker or branches. Over this frame, a waterproof material was stretched, such as treated hide , canvas , or bark . As a result, a coracle was very light, weighing up to just 40 pounds (18 kilograms) and could be easily portaged. While in the water, a coracle could only reach a speed of 1 mile per hour (1.6 kilometers per hour) without the aid of a current. Due to its small size and weight, a coracle was vulnerable to spells such as waterspout .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Coracles were common in the Moonshae Isles , on the River Rauvin , and on Redwaters . They were also a frequent sight within the harbor of Loudwater .</p>
<p>On the Darklake , a series of connected bodies of water in the Underdark , coracles were carved from zurkhwood .</p>
