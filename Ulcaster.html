<p>Ulcaster was a conjurer of note, who founded a school of wizardry, the Ulcaster School of Wizardry , in the small farming village of Beregost in the midâ€“11th century DR .</p>
<p>Roughly eighty years after the school was founded, Calishite mages came to fear the school's power and popularity. During the Year of the Solemn Halfling, 1106 DR , the school was destroyed in a massive spell battle. Ulcaster disappeared during the confusion and was not seen since.</p>
<p>The ruins of the school lay on a hill to the east of Beregost and were said to be haunted. The local clerics of Lathander grazed their sheep near the ruins to keep an eye on things in the area.</p>
<p>Gorion's Ward eventually met Ulcaster's ghost haunting his school.</p>
