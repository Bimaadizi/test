<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The petrified tree was located in a park near the center of town.</p>

<p>It was once a living oak tree large enough to be carved and shaped into a temple, and later magically petrified, turning it to stone. The tree retained its branches and leaves enough to provide shade in the surrounding park.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the midâ€“14 th century DR , the oak tree known as Oakfather's Glen had already been petrified for centuries.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Around 1370 DR , there were at least twenty-five worshipers on site. A druid named Acrull Northshield officiated as the ranking priest and was aided directly by four other druids of the faith of Silvanus with an additional retinue of twenty lesser attendants.</p>
