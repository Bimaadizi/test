<p>The High Vale , also known as the Upper Vale , was the outermost region of Evereska , one that encircled the Vine Vale and the city of Evereska within.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>As with the entirety of Everska, the Upper Vale was itself surrounded by the hills and mountains of the Shaeradim .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The steep-sloped valley was nearly a forest unto itself, mostly covered with massive, old spear spruce trees that rose up to the skies above. It was accessible by a number of switchbacks that came up from the Vine Vale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much of the vale's landscape was destroyed and many of its trees incinerated by phaerimm in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , after the subterranean monstrosities were freed from the Sharn Wall deep underground.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The High Vale housed a number of ancient elfgates that led to long-lost realms of the elven people. One of these magic passageways was known to be linked to the ruins of Sharrven . [ pageÂ needed ]</p>
