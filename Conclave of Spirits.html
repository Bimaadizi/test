<p>The Conclave of Spirits was a collection of spirit nagas who met annually within the Chultengar on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Each spirit naga of the Conclave was a chieftain over a tribe of pterafolk within the jungles of the Chultengar. The spirit nagas met annually deep within the jungles. The Conclave of Spirits was led by a trio of ha-nagas . This meeting was extremely secretive and, as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , only two outsiders had ever witnessed it and escaped with their lives.</p>
