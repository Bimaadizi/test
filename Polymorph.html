<p>Polymorphing was a magical effect in which the subject creature assumed a new physical form while retaining its essential identity and abilities. These effects included the Alter self spell, polymorph spells ( polymorph , baleful polymorph , and polymorph any object ), the shapechange spell, the wild shape druidic ability, and the alternate form special quality. Magic could cause creatures and characters to change their shapesâ€”sometimes against their will but usually to gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retained their own minds but had new physical forms.</p>
<p>The polymorph spell defined the general polymorph effect.</p>
