<p>The weaponry of the golden age was an array of magical artifacts found in the ruins of Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These weapons were high-quality magical equipment made for the elves and their allies, including small , large , and tower shields . The list of weapons included short and long bows ; throwing daggers , hammers , and axes ; bastard , great , short , and long swords ; light and war hammers ; dwarven , great , hand , and battle axes ; great and small clubs ; and great , heavy , and light crossbows , including repeaters ; light and heavy picks ; light and heavy maces ; and daggers , darts , falchions , handwraps , kamas , khopeshes , mauls , morningstars , quarterstaves , rapiers , scimitars , shurikens , and sickles .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Though they individually varied, the weaponry of the golden age generally hit extremely hard with magical entropic and force damage, and could easy slay targets with their vorpal qualities. The thrown weapons were imbued with returning powers for convenience.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Forged in the glory days of Myth Drannor at the peak of its power, these artifacts stood out in the ruins because they had survived the centuries completely unscathed, like the shields of the golden age and unlike the shields and weaponry of the fallen age . Thus, they were highly prized by treasure-hunters looking for intact relics, and were collected by the antiquarian elves Valanice and Rosella Daventhorn . They were also desired by the raiding Red Wizards of Thay under Droic Orgul , who could further improve upon them with powerful necromancy to create the weaponry of the undying age .</p>
