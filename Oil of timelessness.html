<p>Oil of timelessness , or unguent of timelessness , was a concoction employed to guard against deterioration and spoiling.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The smooth oil itself was of dubious appearance, possibly even calling to mind poisonousness.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When labeled as oil, the substance was usually bottled in fractions enough to coat a horse or eight men. After 1372 DR , when it was more often labeled unguent , most containers held enough to coat eight men, four horses, or two elephants . If used on any substance that was only alive, the oil slowed down decay to the point that every year affected it as if only a day had passed. It also rendered the item somewhat more resistant to all forms of damage until removed.</p>
<p>It coated twice as much in the Demiplane of Time .</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Oil of timelessness had several recipes over the years; it required the essence of elementals from the Demiplane of Time in recipes from 1357 DR , powdered amber in recipes from 1367 DR , and just experience in construction of magic items by 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Notable Oils</h2>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
<p>The spell teleport through time called for oil of timelessness as one of its material components .</p>
