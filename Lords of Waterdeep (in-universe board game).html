<p>The Lords of Waterdeep was a strategic board game popular in the city of Waterdeep in the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The board this game was played on featured a depiction of the eponymous City of Splendors. It also came with a number of richly illustrated cards. Some of these cards made references to real organizations, such as the Flaming Fist and the Red Ravens .</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>Playable by up to five or six people, this game revolved around taking on the role of one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and completing quests, which could be imposed upon other players through the use of certain cards called "Mandatory Quests". These cards were emblazoned with titles like "Foil Mercenary Companies" or "Strengthen Civic Bonds". Quests had to be completed within a game "year" and some imposed penalties if not completed. The latter example, it made players take two additional Mandatory Quests for every year that passed without the quest fulfilled.</p>
<p>Some of these quests asked players to accomplish somewhat logical tasks â€“ for example, the aformentioned "Foil Mercenary Companies" card tasked a player with ridding the City of Splendors of mercenary companies conspiring to instigate feuds and armed disputes so as to generate employment. Others, however, were far more fantastic and nonsensical in nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR, Duskrel Bladesemmer was invited to the shady festhall Triumphant Tressym , unbeknownst to him, to play Lords of Waterdeep away from prying eyes and in the company of Janathra and Zelazarelle , two well-endowed highcoin girls that were quite fond of the game. The noble was rather confounded by the game as it was presented and had little time to object before the Harper introducing it had disappeared down a trapdoor. The two highcoin girls then confirmed for the Duskrel that the game had certainly become all the rage in the City of Splendors. Janathra proceeded to offer to share with Duskrel one of her "quests", which he took to be some kind of innuendo, but in actuality was playing card that she had tucked away in the back of her corset . Just as the exasperated noble was rolling his eyes at Janathra, a disheveled and injured Elminster Aumar fell through the ceiling atop of them, being pursued by an assassin .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , whilst searching through multiple rooms for someone, Mirt the Moneylender stumbled upon a group of five men and one woman sat around a table playing Lords of Waterdeep . Just before he closed the door on their room, he witnessed one of the men, with grinning glee proclaim "Time for a mandatory quest, I think!"</p>
