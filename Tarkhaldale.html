<h2>History</h2>
<p>In ancient times, Tarkhaldale flourished as a farming and mining community. When the Anauroch desert spread, the region was abandoned to orc and goblin tribes. In 1360 DR , a group of saurials escaped from their imprisonment by the god Moander and made their home in the dale. Later, the Netherese drove the saurials away and took over the dale.</p>
