<p>Thilren Sohj was a Zhentarim spy inside the Cult of the Dragon in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1489 DR, Thilren managed to infiltrate the Cult under the orders of his Zhent masters. He passed to Welsea Parenthe information about the Cult's interest in Yarash 's pyramid. When Welsea and the Lord Sage of Phlan sent adventurers to discover the secrets of the pyramid for them, she also asked the adventurers to extract Thilren if possible. They were too late, however, because Thilren's contingent of cultists were all slain in the Quivering Forest by an elven party.</p>
