<p>On Receiving Her Grace was an instructional religious text associated with the worship of Loviatar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was not unheard of for copies of the book to become stained or otherwise marked with blood.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The book held instructions for faithful Loviatans on how to properly—and with due reverence to the Lady—perform acts of self-torture. It pointed out that mortal bodies could withstand significant amounts of pain, but should not be scourged so that they became severely injured.</p>
<p>Its pages included numerous diagrams of humanoid forms contorted in horrifying ways, with large enough margins for copious note-taking.</p>
