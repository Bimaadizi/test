<p>The Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach were a collection of independent city-states that separated themselves from Chondath .</p>
<p>Hlondeth , Lachom , Nimpeth , Reth , and Surkh were considered the five key free cities but the villages of Elupar and Nun were often grouped with them as well.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the Rotting War in 902 DR , the Chondathian Empire became weak and lost its hold on several territories. The cities that would become known as the free cities, gained their independence during this time.</p>
<h2>Politics</h2>
<p>Despite no official allegiances, the free cities often supported each other and worked together to prevent Arrabar from regaining the strength it once held.</p>
<p>The free cities did have disputes and small conflicts from time to time but military might was rarely employed.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The free cities all shared a strong military culture and dependence on slavery. Nimpeth made use of slaves more than the other free cities.</p>
<p>Military service was also a shared expectation within the city-states. When a boy reached adulthood, he was expected to serve in his local militia. Slaves rarely served in armies unless they were absolutely needed.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>The Rotting Dance was a festival celebrated in all the free cities. It commemorated the freedom that the cities gained in the Rotting War. The type of celebration varied from city to city; some had parties and parades while others had more respectful ceremonies considering the vast number of people that lost their lives in the conflict.</p>
