<p>The Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye was dedicated to bringing the evil god Tharizdun , an interloper god from the Oerth universe who was imprisoned in the Abyss , into Faerûn . The cult was related to the Church of All Tomorrows, an Oghman heresy that believed its followers should be able to foresee the future.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The cult first appeared in 1340 DR in Akanûl when that country was part of Chessenta . It was destroyed shortly thereafter, possibly with the help of Mystra . In 1479 DR , the cult re-emerged and infiltrated the Firestorm Cabal in Airspur when the demon and cult leader Murmur possessed the body of a high-ranking officer of the cabal. The cult used the vaults underneath the cabal's headquarters to practice its rituals which included human sacrifice.</p>
<p>The deva Demascus was assigned by Oghma to disrupt the cult's activities. With several rogue allies, he killed Murmur and later Kalkan .</p>
