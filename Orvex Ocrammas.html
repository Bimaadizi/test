<p>Orvex Ocrammas ( pronounced : /ˈ ɔːr v ɛ ks oʊ ˈ k r ɔː m ʌ s / OR-vex oh-KRAW-mus ) was a scribe and translator in Chult in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Orvex was pragmatic and mercenary in his choice of employers, but he was genuinely eager to explore and uncover ancient secrets, even at great risk.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orvex was born in the mid–15 th century DR, and was in his early forties and had begun to go bald by the time of the death curse .</p>
<p>During the events of the curse, he worked for a Thayan expedition to Omu led by the Red Wizard Zagmira , although he felt little loyalty to these employers and worked with them solely for the good pay. While investigating the Omuan ruins, he successfully learned to decipher the Old Omuan alphabet, allowing him to read ancient carvings that informed him about the Legend of the Nine Gods as well as about the city's shrines to the Nine Trickster Gods . He created a number of maps of the ruins to show the locations of these shrines.</p>
<p>Eventually, the yuan-ti of Omu attacked the Thayans' encampment, killing most of the expedition. Orvex survived, but an explosion left him buried under a fallen wall, whereupon he was subsequently abandoned. He soon began suffering from exhaustion and dehydration.</p>
