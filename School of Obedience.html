<p>The School of Obedience was a structure on Skull Island in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The School of Obedience was located in the center of Skull Island.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Standing three stories high, the structure was constructed with stone and towered over the surrounding buildings.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the School of Obedience was damp and cold.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The School of Obedience served as a holding facility for slaves, where they were subjected to brutal conditions intended to break their spirits in preparation for lives of servitude. Prisoners given only minimal nourishment to sustain life. Non-compliance with the guards' commands is met with harsh and immediate punishment.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, each slave's abilities were meticulously assessed under the watchful eye of several jailers. Slaves who did not already bear an identifying brand or tattoo were marked with a symbol designating their status as slaves, along with a temporary insignia representing their current owner. This mark was considered temporary, as it was replaced once the slave was sold. After a period of several days, up to a tenday , the slaves were bound in chains in groups of 10 to 20 and transported to the Slavers' Market , where they were sold to the highest bidder. Some were sent to distant regions, such as Thay or Calimshan , while others are less fortunate, destined for the dark reaches of the Underdark to serve drow or illithid masters.</p>
<p>Slaves who remained unsold were subject to grim fates. Some were abandoned in the Underhalls , while others were conscripted into forced labor for public maintenance in Skullport, repairing catwalks and roads until their deaths. A number of these unfortunate individuals were fed to the scrags , while others were sold to necromancers for reanimation, their bodies repurposed in death.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The School of Obedience was continuously patrolled by heavily armed guards, equipped with nets , clubs , and broadswords .</p>
<p>The guards assigned to this facility were the most ruthless members of the Iron Ring and were fanatically loyal to their commander, Quinan Vamaed . The consequences of failure in their duties were severe, with punishment often involving a visit to the Tower of Seven Woes , a fate regarded as worse than death.</p>
