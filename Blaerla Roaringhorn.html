<p>Blaerla Roaringhorn was a lady-in-waiting to princess Alusair Obarskyr in Suzail , the capital of Cormyr , circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blaerla had sparkling brown eyes, brown hair, and bright red lips. She blushed noticeably when she got excited. Her figure fluctuated from pleasantly plump to obese, but was slightly shorter and thinner than her friend Darlutheene Ambershields .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Blaerla was a snoop and a tell-all gossiper, especially if it involved mystery, lies, or scandal. A tendency to be judgemental only increased the embellishment of the gossip she passed on, and she usually returned any slight with spite.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>When not attending the princess, she was the caretaker of three rooms in the Royal Court : the Western Robing Room , the Room of the Ruby Archers , and Lord Valdasher's Solar . These rooms were her base of operations and headquarters for disseminating juicy gossip over mint wine or a white frothy .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Blaerla did not have any close friends other than "Darling Dutheene" Ambershields. Those that found her antics amusing or mostly harmless nicknamed her "the Roarer", but courtiers that suffered from her machinations or just couldn't tolerate her breathless rumor-mongering called her "the Shrieking Horn" or "the Tongue That Never Sleeps".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was born in the Year of the Striking Hawk, 1326 DR , and lived in a tallhouse with three balonies on the Promenade south of the Royal Court, seven doors west of the Dragon's Jaws tavern.</p>
<p>She once related a somewhat salacious bit of gossip about the Royal Magician, Vangerdahast , directly to him while he was shrouded by illusion to look like someone else. The Court Wizard was not amused and the only thing that prevented her from being dismissed was her family name.</p>
