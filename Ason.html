<p>Ason was pickpocket brother of Ginia the courtesan from the isle of Brynnlaw in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>During his time on the island, Ason was a child with chestnut hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ason and his sister Ginia were raised in Brynnlaw since birth. Their mother died very early on, whilst their father was a tailor. Early on, Ginia was offered employment at the Spellhold asylum. After Brynnlaw fell under the control of Desharik , Ason's father was sentenced to death for breaking the law set out by the pirate king. Desharik told the newly orphaned Ginia that she had to pay for her father's crime, as his death wasn't enough. She was given to Chremy , his lieutenant as a reward for his service, who sent her to work as a courtesan against her will. If she refused, Chremy threatened to slaughter Ason, who, in turn, was forced to work for the pirate as a pickpocket on Brynnlaw's streets.</p>
<p>It was rumored that Ginia and her brother were eventually smuggled out of the island by Calahan with help from Abdel Adrian who sought entrance to Spellhold in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . Calahan agreed to take the youths to the village of Ulgoth's Beard , not far from Baldur's Gate , for a fee, where they would be raised by a woman named Therella .</p>
