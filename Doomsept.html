<p>A doomsept was a wraith -like undead creature created using the foul rituals found in the Codex of Araunt . They were bound to serve their creators, the Eminence of Araunt .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Doomsepts resembled humanoid warriors. They wielded wraith-like weapons.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Doomsepts were created by fusing seven different spirits into one being. Each spirit provided a unique characteristic or ability to a given doomsept.</p>
<p>According to some legends, if the name of one of the spirits that composed a doomsept was said loud, the doomsept stopped all activity and the called spirit was compelled to answer the caller, as if under the effect of a speak with dead spell . After all answers were given, the doomsept resumed its attack, this time more viciously.</p>
<p>Doomsepts were mostly found protecting tombs and mausoleums across Laerakond , or in the deathways .</p>
