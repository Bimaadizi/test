<p>Bruha Oakhide , wife of Thatmatt Oakhide , was a commoner inhabitant of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bruha was a brown-eyes and light-skinned gold dwarf with her face splattered in freckles. She kept her face clean shaven and let her mane of red curly hair loose.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the Absolute crisis , Bruha and her husband were faced with the dangers of increased crime and looming war. Thatmatt Oakhide was mugged twice in one month despite him always carrying a weapon and the Flaming Fist outpost in the Basilisk Gate did not bother to act on the couple's reports. Like so many commoners of the Gate, Bruha and Thatmatt were unable to leave the city.</p>
