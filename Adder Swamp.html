<p>The Adder Swamp , sometimes spelled Adderswamp , was a dangerous expanse of lycanthrope -infested marshland that surrounded the Adder River delta in Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The swamp was murky and infested with insects and vermin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the Spellplague and the various catastrophes that befell Chessenta, the Adder Swamp greatly expanded to cover much of the western coast of the Bay of Chessenta .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The swamp was home to both werecrocodiles and wererats , which were in frequent conflict with each other.</p>
<p>The native werecrocodiles had a half-sunken city on the seaward edge of the swamp from where they supposedly claimed dominion over not only the swamp, but all of the Bay of Chessenta as well. By the late 15 th century DR , the werecrocodiles' domain had expanded throughout the swamp as the nation of Sebakar .</p>
<p>The chaotic halfling barony of Ursuma was founded within the swamp sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Like the Adder River, the Adder Swamp was also known for its large snake population. It was also one of the few rare places along the entire coast of Chessenta where sailors would not moor their boats.</p>
