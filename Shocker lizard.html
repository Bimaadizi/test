<p>Shocker lizards were magical beasts that possess the ability to produce electrical effects from their body.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shocker lizards tended to be small and blue in color.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were largely similar to mundane lizards in attitude.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shocker lizards preferred to be left alone. If an intruder entered their territory, the lizard warned off the intruder with a light stunning shock. If the intruder did not leave, the shocker lizard produced large, deadlier electrical discharges. Shocker lizards could work together to produce even more powerful discharges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Quon's shop in Zhentil Keep held a shocker lizard in its kennels.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR , two shocker lizards in the Shadow Swamp on the Plane of Shadow followed a shambling mound back to its den in the Shadowscale Warren . The two species formed a mutualist relationship: they gained the shambler's protection and ate its leavings, while their electric shocks bolstered and healed the shambler.</p>
