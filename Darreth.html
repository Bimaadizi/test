<p>Darreth was a commoner of Womford in the Dessarin Valley in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , he was captured by elemental cultists, members of the Cult of the Crushing Wave . As he disappeared just paces outside his home, the Womford Bat was blamed. They took him to the Fane of the Eye under Tyar-Besil and kept him prisoner for at least a tenday , after which he was bound, gagged, and dragged him to the altar of the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye in order to use him as a sacrifice. However, some adventurers infiltrated the temple and found him. They may have freed him and questioned him for what he'd learned, after which he either bravely joined them to aid their quest or made his way alone through the caverns and back to Womford.</p>
