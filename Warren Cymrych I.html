<p>Warren Cymrych I was High King of the Moonshae Isles in the mid–3 rd century DR . He was the second monarch to hold that title.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Warren I was the founder of the Cymrych Dynasty , named for his father, Cymrych Hugh . He was High King Cymrych's first son, and his mother was Cymrych's second wife.</p>
<p>His successor was his sister, Tamara . His younger brother, Carrig I , would go on to rule after her. Carrig I's heirs would eventually die out, at which point the line of succession returned to Warren I by way of his grandson, Cameron .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Warren I assumed the throne of the High King in Callidyrr after the death of his father in the Year of the Storm Crown, 250 DR . He was thirteen years old, and at the same time, Cedric Riker was made regent in the family's original seat at Corwell . Warren I was not perceived as a strong heir to the High Kingship of his father, and as such, his rule saw the kingdoms of the Ffolk splinter and descended into bickering amongst each other.</p>
<p>In the sixth year of his reign , Illuskan raiders from Tuern and Gundarlun arrived in the Moonshaes and laid claim to the northernmost islands, which the Ffolk were forced to concede. This marked the beginning of the long struggle between the Ffolk and the Northmen , and the start of seasonal raids on the southern islands.</p>
<p>Warren I ruled for nine years before dying of illness in the Year of the Magedirge, 259 DR . Regent Riker would continue to hold his position throughout the young king's entire reign.</p>
