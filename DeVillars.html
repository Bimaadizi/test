<p>The De Villars family was among the most prominent noble houses of Ravens Bluff in the Vast . Their family motto was "Let love be our guide".</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Political influence and the De Villars family went hand in hand, and its members often served in important civic positions within Ravens Bluff. Alongside twelve other families, the De Villars held a hereditary seat on the city's Council of Lords . One example of the family's influence was how Lauren De Villars personally supplied the Ravens Bluff Army with uniforms, ensuring the city's armed forces all carried her uniform design. The city found it unwise to refuse her gift. In a more direct example, Drake De Villars eventually came to serve as the city's Lord Mayor .</p>
<p>Much of the family's wealth came from its ownership of the Tempest Rose Merchant House . The De Villars did not publicly make their ownership known, but it was considered something of an open secret. This vastly successful trading company was the best-connected, wealthiest, and by far the largest merchant house in Ravens Bluff. Far beyond mere trading, the Tempest Rose primarily functioned as a bank, even minting its own currency.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>De Villars Manor was indisputably the grandest residence in all of Ravens Bluff, as well as Laurentowers , a more discreet (yet still palatial) residence. The De Villars also owned three estates in the area surrounding the city: Chanserdun House , an enormous garden estate; Mriteleigh , a large farm estate; and Campopegasus Hall , a "modest" walled country mansion. Collectively, these properties could muster over 530 soldiers when necessary.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The De Villars family were, for the most part, ardent followers of Waukeen . They were also known as friends to the Harpers .</p>
<p>As the foremost noble house of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR , few other families could rival the De Villars for wealth and influence. The De Sheers family came close in both wealth and influence, but their fortunes dwindled after the war against Myrkyssa. The Hawktalons were nearly as rich as the De Villars, but commanded far less influence. The Ampner family were chief competitors of the De Villars in the wine trading business. Additionally, the Cathones considered the De Villars to be their chief rivals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Alongside the Moorland and Therogeon families, the De Villars (then Daefihlars) were the first settlers of the site that would eventually come to be known as Ravens Bluff. They arrived in the spring of the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR , bringing with them armed companies to help fend off the many dangers in this untamed region of the Vast. The nascent settlement survived, albeit in a somewhat beleaguered state, and soon other families were drawn to the area. In the Year of the Black Buck, 1226 DR , more than a dozen more families joined the De Villars (and the Moorlands and Therogeons). Over time, the settlement became known as Ravens Bluff.</p>
<p>The early history of Ravens Bluff, as it rapidly expanded into a bustling city, was fraught with odds-defying success, but also discord and instability. Orc and hobgoblin raids were common, and the city was essentially ruled by feuding noble families who directly controlled the city government. In the mid-13 th century DR , James De Villars , the city's Chief Alderman, personally appointed Ravens Bluff's first Regent of the Harbor to establish law and order for seaborne vessels. Another prominent early De Villars was Kartha Daefihlars , who served as Lord Treasurer circa the Year of the Grimoire, 1324 DR .</p>
<p>It was during this early period of instability, in the Year of Thunder, 1306 DR , that Lauren De Villars—future matriarch of the De Villars family—was born to Malamin and Salinay De Villars . In the Year of the Wanderer, 1338 DR , Lady Lauren was named high priestess of Waukeen in Ravens Bluff.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gate, 1341 DR , Lauren De Villars, by then considered one of the wealthiest and most civic-minded lords of the city, convinced her fellow nobles into hosting the Champions Games , a martial contest whose winner would be granted the position of Lord Mayor. The hope was that a strong central leadership would unite the fractious city into a cohesive, lawful whole. If the contest also happened to claim the lives of a few ambitious pirates and unscrupulous nobles, the De Villars saw this as an added bonus. The hosting of the Games was seen as a desperate gamble by most citizens, with many concerned that Ravens Bluff would become the domain of a ruthless pirate or adventurer . Yet Lauren De Villars's plan worked out splendidly: the winner, Charles Oliver O'Kane , turned out to be an exceptionally able and fair leader for the city. He was, of course, given ample advice and guidance from Lady Lauren. Through decades of their combined leadership, Ravens Bluff grew safer and vastly more prosperous. With Lady Lauren as matriarch, the De Villars family became known not just for its incredible wealth and influence, but also its commitment to philanthropy and the city's well-being. With that said, most citizens of Ravens Bluff were devoted to Lady Lauren herself—not necessarily her extended family.</p>
<p>Lady Lauren married Lord Daimler , and they had four children together before his passing: Drake, Bethany , Chantel , and Ramsey . Bethany and Chantel both became priestesses of Waukeen in Procampur , having been subtly encouraged by their mother to move away from Ravens Bluff to become more independent. Eventually, Lady Lauren called them back to the city and began involving them in the family business and political schemes —Bethany more so than Chantel. Lauren's eldest son, Drake, chose to follow the path of a knight and served the city as a member of several knightly orders, winning great acclaim during the war against Myrkyssa Jelan. Ramsey De Villars fell in with the Consortium of the Bloody Fang and became a vampire , only to be slain on the eve of his wedding to Revelmistress Rachel Arren after kidnapping his own bride.</p>
<p>When mayoral elections were held in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , following the war against the warlord Myrkyssa Jelan , the defeat of the De Villars-backed Charles O'Kane in favor of newcomer Amber Lynn Thoden was seen as an indication, by some, that the influence of the De Villars on city politics was waning.</p>
