<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jorag was owned by a Chessentan wizard of dubious reputation, who, to boost his best fighter's chances in the gladiatorial pits, ensured Jorag was always equipped with the latest and best. When an especially grand win of Jorag Muthkik's made the wizard a fortune in bets, he created a famous enchanted bludgeon called gladiator's club . The club was given to Jorag as a gift. Subsequently, the famed gladiator succeeded in retiring from gladiatorial pits and became a teacher at a gladiatorial school in Chessenta, where the gladiator's club was used to discipline unruly students.</p>
