<p>The Chromatic Demon was a tanar'ri imprisoned in Watcher's Keep in Amn .</p>
<p>He was forced into Helm 's service to secure the Imprisoned One in the keep. He guarded a level of the dungeon imprisoned in a magical cage, and only he had the key for the next level. Eventually, the demon met Gorion's Ward and convinced him to release him in exchange for the key. But when Gorion's Ward collected all the items to free the Chromatic Demon, the demon tried to kill Gorion's Ward but was instead killed himself.</p>
