<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leona was an older, sophisticated, tall, straight-shouldered woman with a head of bright red hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Leona was an extremely competent event organizer, even though her skills could've been described as micro-managing. She gladly took on countless tasks in preparation forÂ her daughter's wedding, consulting with every single worker to ensure perfection, including placements of lanterns and landscaping.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Even though Leona and Dimswart loved Gaylyn and five older daughters, they were happy to wed them all off and retire in peace, enjoying occasional family visits.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Alias of Westgate sought Dimswart's aid with the mysterious azure magical glyph tattoo, she'd woken up with one day. She arrived at the Dimswart Manor just a few days ahead of Gaylyn's wedding to a member of the noble Wyvernspur family, Frefford Wyvernspur . The wedding reception required the rescuing of a bard named Olive Ruskettle who was hired to sing but was captured by a fearsome red dragon on her way to the manor. Alias successfully returned the halfling bard and brought her just in time for the wedding.</p>
<p>Alias and her traveling companions were invited to the reception by Leona, mostly out of etiquette. Lady Leona managed to entertain the guests and monitor the event. She sternly disapproved of Dragonbait 's juggling her finest wedding crystal for the guests' amusement. However, the reception was eventually ruined by Alias. The azure glyphs forced her to attack the groom's cousin Giogi after confusing him with King Azoun . After the tent was collapsed and Alias fled, Leona resumed entertaining the guests but not after catching Olive with her pockets full of loot snatched during the chaos.</p>
