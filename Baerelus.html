<p>Baerelus the Bold was a satyr and local expert on the lore, flora, and fauna of the King's Forest of Cormyr around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Beloved by the people, he enjoyed serving as a guide and source of wise advice to many young Cormyreans within the area. He was kept informed of what was going on within Cormyr by the confessions of the young folk he spoke to in his daily travels. King Azoun IV was known to stop by the forest with a sumptuous meal to learn from Baerelus' experience. While he wouldn't reveal any secrets told to him in confidence, Baerelus gave the king a shrewd picture of the nation of Cormyr. Azoun was keen on heeding most of what Baerelus told him.</p>
