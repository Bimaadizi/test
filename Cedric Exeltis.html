<p>Cedric Exeltis was the member of the noble Exeltis merchant clan to bring them wealth and power through trade, several generations before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cedric Exeltis was renowned as the first man to develop the recipe for the rare and expensive Exeltis Ice Wine â€“ a rich and potent red wine fermented using a unique type of tiny, fragile grey grapes that grew in the vineries around the Blade Cliffs region of the Sword Coast . Cedric's creation brought impressive wealth and status to the family for many generations until it all was gambled away by murderous Feldran Exeltis , by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
