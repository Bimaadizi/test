<p>The sacrificial dagger was the personal ritual dagger of Priestess Vicala Szind of Sschindylryn in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blade had a curved point and many barbs angled backwards, ensuring that it would cause massive tearing when pulled from a wound. It bore a sickly yellow glow from the virulent enchantments upon it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The dagger had lethal and gruesome enchantments , including a vampiric negative energy bite that drained the life force of the victim and transferred it to the wielder. It also exuded a terrible poison that weakened the target rather than killing them too quickly, and possessed a powerful +6 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the weapon's natural damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Priestess Vicala had the blade during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar during the Darkening , when she attacked the Midler farmhouse and took the Midler family as sacrificial prisoners. During her time around Eveningstar , she used the blade to sacrifice many innocent farmers.</p>
