<p>Sister of Rains was a canyon-oasis found in the desert of Anauroch in North Faer√ªn . The settlement was a refuge for those Bedine who were outcast from their tribes, such as witches, wizards and other spellcasters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The oasis was located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword , at the base of the eastern slopes of the Wall of the Fallen Djinn mountain range, west of the desolate expanse known as the Shoal of Thirst . Due to this precarious location, the settlement of outcasts was well-isolated from the other settlements of the Bedine tribes.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Sister of Rains was nestled in a steep-walled canyon, accessible by a narrow gulch that was dotted with plant life. Freshwater springs poured out the canyon's walls on its southern side, forming the pools from which the oasis took its name.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>A natural grove arose from the Sister's pools of water, one that included scores of fig trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the Sister of Rains was still the home of magic-wielding outcasts who had been exiled or otherwise abandoned by the Bedine people. By the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , the oasis was abandoned, no longer home to anything but the bones of the dead and mere scavenging jackals .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The only notable landmark within the Sister of Rains was a ruined tower, that was built long before the Era of Upheaval by a tribe of Bedine that did not survive to that era.</p>
