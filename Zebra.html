<p>Zebras were a species of wild horse related to the more common domestic breeds of horses.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zebras were distinguished from other species of horses by the striking patterns their fur displayed—broad, alternating, vertical stripes of black and white.</p>
<p>Rather than having the neigh or whinny common among other equine species, zebras uniquely displayed a distinctive "bark".</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
