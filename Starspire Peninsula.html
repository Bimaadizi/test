<p>The Starspire Peninsula was a rocky and sparsely-inhabited peninsula, part of the County Starspur in Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The majority of the Starspire Peninsula was covered in hard to traverse mountains, speckled with sea caves and cliffs, and inhabited by monsters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Starspire Peninsula was imaginatively named after the mountain chain that was part of it – the Starspire Mountains . The peninsula was framed by the Bay of Bormul to the south and the Firedrake Bay to the north. Further north, past the Firedrake Bay, was the Dragon's Neck Peninsula that laid parallel to the Starspire Peninsula. The town of Port Kir stood not far from the peninsula's northern edge, and the Trade Way ran perpendicular to the peninsula, separating it from the rest of Tethyr. The city of Zazesspur stood further south, and its harbors were sheltered from storms by the Starspire Peninsula.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Starspire Peninsula was a virtually ungoverned region. It was controlled by the County Starspur and its Count or Countess. The Countess circa 1370 DR was Corinna Dezlentyr who elected to leave the monstrous inhabitants of the Peninsula alone, but kept its edges well patrolled to protect the rest of her domain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Port Kir sent out a message to attract adventuring bands with marine experience. Several fishing ships went missing in presumably safe waters to the west of the regular fishing areas. The town's government knew nothing about the disappearances, but they knew that pirates were not to blame as there had been no buccaneer attacks on fishing vessels in ages. The culprit was the Split Mast tribe of seafaring orcs that recently claimed a lair on the rocky shores of the Starspire Peninsula.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Most inhabitants of the Starspire Peninsula were dangerous and deadly creatures and humanoids, including firedrakes , perytons , displacer beasts , goblins , ogres , hobgoblins , hippogriffs , bugbears , constantly warring cyclopskin , flinds , and werewolves . A large population of svirfneblin made home underneath the Starspire Peninsula and its mountains. And to the east from the peninsula, Balagos and the dragons of the Wyrmwell were a constant threat to the region. The waters around the Peninsula were far from calm, they were plagued by hostile tribes of sea elves , sahuagin , and sea trolls .</p>
