<p>Elduth Yarmmaster was the Overmaster of the Council of Sembia , the governing body of the nation of Sembia in the mid–14 th century DR . He was based in the capital, Ordulin .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Elduth was well known for his maturity, wisdom, and kind nature. He was also eloquent and possessed of a good sense of humor. He was often the voice of reason in the Council. At the council in Suzail, however, Azoun thought him too relaxed, and almost lacking courtesy.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Circa 1360 DR, Elduth was rather overweight and flabby, with multiple chins. By 1367 DR, Elduth was aged and very frail.</p>
<p>Befitting his position, he dressed in rich robes with gold rings.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Considered a great statesman, Elduth was renowned for his sage council, at least to those who agreed with it. While there was always those who disagreed, were unhappy with his leadership, or were eager to replace him, they satisfied themselves with knowing that at least he'd be dead soon and then Sembia would get a fresh and foolish start. Nevertheless, while alive, Elduth kept a sensible grip on power, but groups such as the Iron Throne jockeyed for power in the time after.</p>
<p>As Yarmmaster, Elduth officially governed the capital city of Ordulin, but in practice it was equally controlled by the Council and the merchant class.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>An old friend of Elduth's was Halath Tymmyr , the high bergun of Daerlun circa 1367 DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Elduth led the Sembian delegation to the council to discuss the Tuigan threat hosted by King Azoun IV of Cormyr in Suzail on Tarsakh 10 , the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR . Elduth was concerned the Tuigan might spy on them, and queried why Rashemen could not deal with them alone, though Fonjara Galth proved him wrong. In the end, Elduth pledged no troops to the crusade—Sembia had no significant standing army to speak of—but declared Sembia would provide supplies, ships, and funds for 4,000 mercenaries to the Army of the Alliance .</p>
<p>Elduth had enjoyed several terms in office, with his third only just beginning around 1367 DR . However, he was not expected to see it to the end.</p>
<p>At some point, Elduth ordered the conversion of a mine inside a dead-magic zone in Yhaunn into the notorious prison known as the Hole . There, it was said, he sent his political and commercial rivals to work and die.</p>
<p>At the time, prompted by reduced elf populations in north Faerûn , some Sembians lobbied the Overmaster to annex all the troubles lands between the Dragon Reach , Hillsfar , Mistledale , and the Thunder Peaks , but he declined, warning that the neighboring realms of Cormyr , the Dalelands , and the Moonsea would resist such a move with force. Instead, Elduth argued that Sembia play a waiting game and quietly support these lands, and quietly usurp them if need be.</p>
<p>Elduth finally passed away from old age in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . He was succeeded by Kendrick Selkirk .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was said that potions of longevity were no longer extending his life, but keeping him alive.</p>
