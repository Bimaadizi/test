<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was clever, diplomatic, and ambitious.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Maaqua possessed one of the Crowns of Whispers , which made her more charismatic, as well as the Greatsword of Impiltur , a mighty and storied weapon. Both of these items had been left with her people by the demon lord Soneillon during the events of the Spellplague nearly a century prior.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Her machinations had earned her ties with the Kingdom of Damara , which she leveraged in order to gain the right to levy "taxes" on travelers along the Long Road through the Giantspire Gap .</p>
<p>She was also expansionistic, driving her Razor Hearts to absorb neighboring tribes within the Giantspires. She vied for control over the Giantspire Gap with the Blood Mountain clan, and clashed with the Black Wolf tribe of the southern Giantspires, whose cheiftan— Aruugan —possessed the other Crown of Whispers .</p>
