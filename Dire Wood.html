<p>The Dire Wood , also known as the Enchanted Wood , was an ancient and supernatural area within the High Forest found in the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dire Wood was made of black, petrified trees that appeared to be dead, but were actually entirely unkillable. The soil of the forest floor was red in hue, and gave way to uneven hills and peaty bogs. Much of the landscape was covered in wild and decaying overgrowth. While it appeared normal from outside its borders, once within the woods became freezing cold and began to reek of death and decay.</p>
<p>Wild magic permeated the woods, emanating from the arcane landmark within its center. The geographically-morphic traits of its existence within the surrounding forest played tricks on the senses of anyone that dared travel within.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Strange weather patterns including "wizard weather" were reported throughout the Dire Wood. These phenomena included falling snow the color and smell of blood, rain as hot as boiling water, and hail that would explode when striking the earth.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Dire Wood was situated in the eastern reaches of the High Forest, surrounding the source of the Heartblood River .</p>
<p>The space it occupied within changed depending on the observer. Anyone walking the circumfrence of the woods outside its border would continue for approximatley 4 mi (6.4 km), whereas someone doing the same from within would go on for 60 mi (97 km). Essentially the Dire Wood was similar to a bag of holding , the space within the woods were much larger than it was from outside.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The outer border of the woods that designated its change of dimensions were marked by a ring of massive albino oak trees known as the Pale Ring .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Cultists founded the city of Karse at this location after Karsus's Folly in Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR , but it fell into ruin shortly thereafter due to internal religious strife.</p>
<p>Around a thousand years later in the Year of the Giant's Oath, 883 DR , a wizard from Ascalhorn named Wulgreth came to the ruins to raise an undead army using epic magic . His spell was interrupted however by his henchman, Jhingleshod the Axeman. The release of the necromantic energy caused Wulgreth to become a lich and the nearby forest was transformed into the Dire Wood.</p>
<p>For centuries after its formation, the Dire Wood continued to expand at a rate of approximately 80 ft (24 m) each year. This growth stopped during the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , when magic across the Realms ceased functioning as expected.</p>
<p>Just prior to the Rage of Dragons in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the gold dragon Aerosclughpalar retired to the Dire Wood to prepare for the madness that would inevitibly consume him. When he succummbed to the King-Killer Star 's magical effects, he annihilated much of the petrified woods and the monstrosities that dwelled within.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Legend said that the Dire Wood was so named for a horrific massacre of humans many years before the age of ancient Netheril . It was said this mass-killing led to the red soil that covered the forest floor. Yet others believe it was the actions of Karsus that imbued the wood with its eldritch evil.</p>
<p>Stories of the Dire Wood's peculiar nature spread as far away as Loudwater .</p>
<p>It was speculated by some sages that the woods could be a point from which travel to an alternate Prime Material plane was possible.</p>
