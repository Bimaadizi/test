<p>Rhindaun Dynasty was one of the ruling dynasties of Tethyr , founded by the adventuress Zaranda Star Rhindaun .</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The dynasty took its name from King-Consort Haedrak's mother, Rhinda , second wife of Alemander V .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dynasty was officially founded in 1368 DR . In the previous year, on Mirtul 3 (called Crowning Day ), Zaranda Star had been proclaimed queen by the citizens of Zazesspur . She spent several months speaking with leaders of the country and gaining support from the rest of the cities. She was blessed by the Archdruid of Mosstone on Highharvestide and selected and renamed Darromar as her new capital. Saradush and the Order of the Silver Chalice accepted her as queen in 1368. After Zaranda Star won the Reclamation Wars and married the lost prince of Tethyr, Haedrak Rhindaun III, her official coronation was in 1369 DR .</p>
<p>The full line of succession for the dynasty is unknown, but Queen Zaranda's first daughter Sybille succeeded her as the second queen of the line. Later rulers in the Rhindaun dynasty were Queen Cyriana and King Errilam , and Queen Anais , who ruled as early as 1468 DR and at least as late as 1489 DR . Sybille's niece Princess Jemra Rhindaun married into the Obarskyr dynasty of Cormyr in 1430 DR .</p>
