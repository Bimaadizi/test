<p>However, Masgar grew sickly and for a number of years depended on his daughter Pouri for assistance. Working at her father's side, she learned his administrative skills.

For some seven months, she maintained the deception and good governance of Foo Nakar.</p>
<p>When King Wanang visited his friend's burial mound and discovered it already grown over, Pouri had to admit the truth.
