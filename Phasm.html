<p>Phasms were amorphous shapechangers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In their true form, phasms resembled amorphous, colorful oozes about 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter and 2 feet (0.61 meters) tall, and weighed about 400 pounds (180 kilograms). However, they were natural shapechangers that could take the form of almost any creature or object.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Phasms were chaotic and unreliable, more interested in enjoying themselves and having new experiences than anything else, as their shapechanging ability freed them from most material needs, letting live lives of exploration, hedonism, or contemplation as they wished.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Besides their shapechanging ability, phasms had tremorsense as long as they were touching the ground, and they could speak telepathically.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Faced with danger, a phasm was equally likely to attack, retreat, or parley, according to their whims. Opponents who offered some new experience, though, had a good chance of avoiding a fight. When combat broke out, however, a phasm would transform into the most fearsome creature they could.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Phasms did not live near each other, but were known to live among other peoples. They were natural but unreliable spies, since they often didn't feel the need to report in; however, they had an affinity for doppelgangers and would ally with them for security or fun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1372 DR, there were phasm members of the Unseen .</p>
