<p>Amulets of Laeral's tears were named after the famed sorceress , Laeral Silverhand . They temporarily bestowed greater health upon those who wore the amulet against their skin.</p>
<p>A variant of these amulets, known as an Amulet of Dark Blessing , were found among the drow of the Underdark and besides their appearance they functioned identically.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Strung along these amulets were soft, brittle, and colorless fancy stone crystals known as Laeral's tears . They were often large and kept a glossy, magnificent finish. The Underdark-wrought Amulets of Dark Blessing were crafted using a single iridescent black gemstone, however.</p>
<p>After being expended, both versions of the amulet would crumble to dust.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Whilst worn next to the skin the amulet bestowed a temporary increase to one's health. However, once this bonus health had been eroded (via injury) then the amulet crumbled into worthless dust.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Witches of Rashemen used to craft these amulets using many large colorless stones.</p>
