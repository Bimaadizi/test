<p>Lady Yuth was a merchant of magic scrolls , who did business in the City of Coin, Athkatla in Amn in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Lady Yuth could be found selling her curios and enchanted wares at the Adventurer Mart in Athkatla's grand Waukeen's Promenade . Lady Yuth talked to customers whom she noticed searching for very specific merchandise, dealing in her schools from behind a bookshelf, away from prying eyes. She held little respect for the Cowled Wizards and thought them to be corrupt fools, like every other person in the position of power in Athkatla.</p>
