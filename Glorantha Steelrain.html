<p>Glorantha Steelrain was a talented bladesinger , active in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By her 133 th birthday, Glorantha was a well-respected elven bladesinger, master of the longsword , and a one-woman army. She bore a tattoo of a great cat that signified her formidable battle prowess and complimented her cat-like grace. Glorantha made her name traveling along the Sword Coast , working to benefit her elven kin. However, few believed her deeds as the woman was prone to exaggeration, and because she traveled alone, her heroics rarely had any witnesses.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 14 th century DR, Glorantha Steelrain was among adventurers interested in being sent into a mysterious dungeon by an unnamed sorceress to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths.</p>
