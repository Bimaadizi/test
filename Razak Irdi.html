<p>Razak Irdi was a barbarian nomad and member of the Kashghun tribe in the Plain of Horses circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) . He was a notorious horse rustler.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Irdi lived in the city of Chegoyui in the Quoya Desert until around Shou Year 2600 (1350 DR) , when he stole one of the most valuable huluk horses belonging to the qaghan . He fled north and remained apart ever since.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Irdi lived as a lone nomad, sleeping through the day and moving at night, never settling anywhere, and avoiding contact with his fellow humans . In fact, he preferred the company of wild horses and always traveled with a herd of wild horses, numbering 20–50, as well as twelve wild dogs . His own mount was a black huluk named Dohju . All these beasts seemed completely obedient and dedicated to their master.</p>
<p>Occasionally, he conducted thefts and raids on camps in order to free horses from their owners. Naturally, he was seen as a thief and a pest and many times people had tried to apprehend Irdi but with no success.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had a small build but thick legs. His eyes were described as darting.</p>
