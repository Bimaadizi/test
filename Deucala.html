<p>Deucala was a werewolf from Moray in the Moonshae Isles during the mid-to-late 15 th century DR . She was the matriarch of the lycanthropes of the Black Blood tribe along the northern coast of the island.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her offspring included daughters Bay and Lightfoot as well as son Coal . Deucala and her children were all given these names by her adopted daughter, the half- le Shay Amaranth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1460s DR, Deucala found a nine-year-old Amaranth, who was injured and starving after falling from the back of a hippogriff as it fled the nearby island of Gwynneth . Deucala raised her, but she quickly became the de facto leader of the lycanthropes at Caer Moray , where her followers (including her adoptive siblings) were fiercely protective of her.</p>
<p>Deucala passed away sometime prior to the revival of the god Malar in the late 1470s DR.</p>
