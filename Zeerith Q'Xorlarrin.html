<p>Zeerith Q'Xorlarrin was the matron mother of House Xorlarrin of Menzoberranzan . She was matron mother as of 1361 DR and remained in that position as of 1484 DR , when House Xorlarrin moved to the city of Q'Xorlarrin .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was known for her diplomatic skills and other houses often called upon her to mediate in disputes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zeerith moved her house from Menzoberranzan to the new city of Q'Xorlarrin in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR . Her family was deeply involved with the Darkening . Although Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre called the Xorlarrin house wizard Tsabrak Xorlarrin to be the house wizard for the restored House Do'Urden , Zeerith refused to allow him to leave Q'Xorlarrin because she wanted him to become Archmage of Q'Xorlarrin, since his channeling of Lolth (the first since the destruction of House Oblodra ) made him a rival to Gromph Baenre , the Archmage of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Zeerith's brother was the mage and later lich Kharza-kzad Xorlarrin . Her house patron was the mage Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin until his death during the Spellplague .</p>
<p>Zeerith had a number of children, including Brack'thal and Ravel Xorlarrin . Brack'thal was both brother and father to Ravel after Zeerith took his seed while he was semi-comatose. Berellip Xorlarrin was her eldest daughter.</p>
