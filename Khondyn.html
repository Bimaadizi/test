<p>Khondyn (or mushroom pies ) were a kind of edible mushroom found mainly around Blustich .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Khondyn mushrooms were wide, circular, dun-brown flat-capped mushrooms that looked like plates balanced on stalks. As they aged and started to rot they turned dark brown and eventually a glistening black, though they remained perfectly edible if not palatable.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Khondyn were common around Blustich on the coast of Cormyr but rare elsewhere, and regularly harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with uttercaps and thoud mushrooms, particularly before winter.</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>A single mushroom pie was large enough to be a full meal for an adult, and could be eaten raw with a taste similar to breaded chicken . When fried the taste became similar to a sharp cheddar cheese , and when baked atop bread or flatbread dough it imparted a broader cheesy taste.</p>
