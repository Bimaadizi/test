<p>Jazirat al-Sayyad , or the Hunter , was an elongated island located in the Nada al-Hazan achipelago within the Crowded Sea .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Jazirat al-Sayyad had extremely rocky shores, marking it as dangerous sailing territory for mariners. Stormy swells and whirling waters threatened to shatter any approaching ship against the rocks.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>This island was the home of the magnificent Sayyad bloodline of horses , making it a tempting destination for brave or greedy sailors. The herds were carefully watched over by herdsman genies who were bound long ago by a powerful sha'ir .</p>
<p>Buying a horse from the genies often required an extraordinary payment and only buyers possessing admirable qualities were considered.</p>
