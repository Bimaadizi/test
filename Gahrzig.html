<p>Gahrzig was a wemic chief and mercenary who worked for Pristoleph , a powerful figure in the city of Innarlith , on several occasions during the 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Senator Pristoleph began building an army at Firesteap Citadel in the Firesteap Mountains south of Innarlith in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , with the intention of invading the city-state and overthrowing Ransar Salatis . He hired a large number of wemic mercenaries from the Shaar as part of his army, including Gahrzig and his tribe. He paid them with magic weapons.</p>
<p>Gahrzig was present in the final assault on the Palace of Many Spires in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , which ended when Salatis's own bodyguards murdered him and power was handed over to Pristoleph. Gahrzig and his wemics were present with Pristoleph outside the door of Salatis's bedchamber when the bodyguards presented the body of their former ruler to Pristoleph.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a faction of senators united together against Ransar Pristoleph and Gahrzig with his wemics again fought for Pristoleph in the civil war that ensued. He was wounded by acid from a black firedrake during street fighting, but survived.</p>
