<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shortly before the Chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Hulder Phelbellow and other merchants made Thessamel Arunder an offer for his lands and tower, which consisted of 200,000 gp , his continued tenancy, and twelve deer a year, dressed for the table; in return, he was not to work magic against them. He responded to the offer by turning them into pigs for the evening.</p>
<p>Later, Faeya , Thessamel's apprentice, came to them and begged for them to try the offer again, as he was now unable to work magic. Faeya got Thessamel to sign the contract through a little bedroom trickery; on the morning, Hulder Phelbellow and other merchants came to Thessamel's door. There, after trading some barbs, they gave him the money and he received an explanation of what he'd signed.</p>
