<p>Variscite , also known as lucinite and peganite , was an ornamental stone found in nodules or in rock seams.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This stone was translucent and came in deep to pale shades of yellowish green. When cut cabochon and polished they occasionally displayed gray and yellow bands or rings ("eyes"). A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Variscite was poisonous to lycanthropes and, if delivered into the bloodstream on the tip of a weapon, caused triple the normal damage for that strike. Once a lycanthrope was infected with variscite, further exposure did no additional harm until the subject recoveredâ€”a process that took a full 24 hours. Infection could also be accomplished if a variscite stone, say mounted in a ring or other jewelry, were pressed into an open wound on a lycanthrope, or touched to the creature's tongue.</p>
