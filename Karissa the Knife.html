The only way to get in was to traverse a lengthy series of underground tunnels and chambers, filled with traps and monsters that she laid out for visitors. When the Riverside Rats came for their revenge against the Night Brigade, they sent allies ahead to bypass the hazards and face the deadly rogue. Surviving such threats as a ballista and otyugh , the invaders finally found Karissa in her lair and slew her.</p>
