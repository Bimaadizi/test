<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1482 DR , the hand of this statue, as well as others, was severed. Rilsa Rael had her thieves commit this act, whilst a group of patriar youths did the same to the Beloved Ranger , a well-known statue. All but those of the Outer City were outraged, and the Flaming Fist conducted a thorough search of the region, particularly organizations known to purchase stolen goods. However, nothing turned up. Horgold Hadru took in the noble youths who had actually vandalised the Beloved Ranger, as he owed one of the patriar families.</p>
