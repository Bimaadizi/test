<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Kashada was allied with Zasian Menz , a priest of Cyric in Sundabar . She wanted to raise a Sharran temple in Sundabar to take her revenge on the North . She disguised herself as "Ansa" (who was in fact Aliisza in disguise) and replaced her in the Master's Hall in Sundabar . Some time later she was captured by Tauran and Micus , astral deva servants of Tyr , and imprisoned in a sphere of light with no shadows, which drove her insane.</p>
<p>Twelve years later she was freed by Zasian with the help of Myshik Morueme . She regained her sanity and journeyed with Zasian and Myshik to Dweomerheart , where they were able to cause a distraction and steal Azuth 's staff . Kashada was revealed to be an aspect of Shar, and plunged a dagger into Zasian's back. Cyric subsequently used Azuth's staff to slay Mystra .</p>
