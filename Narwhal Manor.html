<p>Narwhal Manor was a customs office and the main customs warehouse for the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building was located in the city's Harbor District , in the neighborhood of Seaglimpse or what may have once been a part of " Old Town ", in a block of buildings known unofficially as "Gimble's Elbow", facing the waters of the Dragon Coast .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Narwhal Manor was a fortress-like stone building, standing two stories tall and measuring 50 ft (15 m) x 30 ft (9.1 m), with a watch tower atop its roof.</p>
<p>The exterior had a small patio with chairs, enclosed by a 6 feet (1.8 meters) high gated wrought- iron fence. A pair of heavy, wooden doors closable with beams from outside, granted entry into the front and rear of the building. The ground floor had sparse windows, measuring a narrow 2 ft (0.61 m) width, with exterior iron bars. The second floor also had narrow windows, though they were far more numerous, offering views from all four directions.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The ground floor largely comprised the building's warehouse, with rooms off to the side housing the records room and the custom officer's office. Connected to the office was a safety-deposit room, guarded by a massive iron door and lock . A staircase in the main room lead up to the second floor, which served as a residential space.</p>
<p>The second-floor housed the custom officer's quarters, the servant's quarters, a guest room, a small library, a parlor, and a spiral staircase that led up to the roof and watch tower. In the hallway of the second floor was a weapon case, displaying Draco Elass 's +2 long bow . The parlor had a shield hung on the wall, a globe of Toril , and a display case showing off mementos from Draco's past life as a sea captain, including an enchanted ship's spyglass .</p>
<p>The watch tower of Narwhal Manor was once home to the legendary Calvan's bell . This came to an end 1343 DR , when the bell was moved to the newly constructed Ladyrock Lighthouse .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Narwhal Manor primarily served as the main warehouse for Ravenian customs. All manner of valuable exports and imports were stored in the safety-deposit room while they were either waiting to be examined and cleared by customs or for any duties or taxes levied on them to be paid off. Less valuable goods were stored in the central warehouse room. Narwhal Manor also stored all cargo confiscated by customs until they were ready for disposition, as well as all records concerning exports & imports.</p>
<p>Beyond customs business, the chief customs inspector was well known for receiving and lavishly entertaining guests. These were most often visiting sea captains.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The building was inhabited by Draco Elass, Ravens Bluff's chief customs inspector and one of the six Harbormasters under the command of Calvin Longbottle , alongside his adopted daughter Docara , who masqueraded as his manservant. Docara started living there in 1353 DR , after Draco found her washed up on the beach from a shipwreck and nursed her back to health. She was rarely found far from Narwhal Manor and seldom talked to visitors.</p>
