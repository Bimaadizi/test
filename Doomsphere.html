<p>A doomsphere was the ghost of a beholder .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Doomspheres appeared as transluscent, glowing beholders but otherwise looked much as they did in life. When visible, they appeared to be composed of a cloudy substance which had no mass.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to the many powers that a doomsphere posessed as a ghost, such as being incorporeal and having the abilty to possess living beings, they had several terrible powers unique to their origins as beholders. A doomsphere's central eye retained its antimagic field of vision, but most of its eyestalks developed different and more necromantic powers than the doomsphere had weilded in life. While it retained the eye ray that slowed and the eye ray that caused fear , it also gained the ability to fire a ray of enervation , a ray of hold monster , a ray of animate dead , a ray of unholy blight , a ray that seared flesh with magical acid , a ray that shattered bone and chitine, a ray that caused the victim's strength and fortitude to wither, and a ray of cold light that attacked a target's constitution.</p>
<p>Doomspheres were unable to harness psionics , however they were highly resistant to such powers.</p>
<p>Some doomspheres could compel a victim to harm itself.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In general, a doomsphere was a beholder of such avarice, wrath, and strength of will that it was able to sustain itself as an undead being. Since doomspheres had already tasted death once, they were often cautious and avoided engaging in senseless violence. Nevertheless, they thirsted to punish the living or seek revenge for their deaths.</p>
<p>Most doomspheres could not speak, although they could read and write.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In a fight, doomspheres attacked with their many ocular powers and with their ghostly, chilling bite. They tended to be careful, preferring to hide inside the ground or ceiling while spying on foes with their eyestalks, and then emerging suddenly to fire off eye rays at surprised targets. Doomspheres made a horrific shriek as they attacked.</p>
<p>Doomspheres were difficult to turn and highly resistant to most mind- and body-altering spells . They were immune to all forms of magical cold and electricity, and could only be harmed by powerful magic weapons and spells. When injured, a chunk of the cloudy substance that comprised their bodies would be carried away. It was not possible to disable the central eye or sever any individual eyestalks of a doomsphere, but directly attacking an eyestalk could cause its power to discharge and then take a short while to recharge.</p>
<p>A doomspere that was slain in combat would simply dissipate and then reform the next day unless the area was cleansed with spells of remove curse and protection from evil .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A doomsphere was generally created as a product of a magical explosion, sometimes produced by wild magic from failed efforts to create contingencies against their own deaths. They were solitary creatures, and would haunt the area in which they died. They spent much of their time invisible and unmoving unless they detected a living creature nearby, in which case they became consumed with the desire to kill it. While they could be destroyed in combat with the aid of a cleric , they could also be destroyed if their peculiar or sometimes ironic sense of vengeance for their death was appeased.</p>
<p>Doomspheres avoided contact with other doomspheres, and were liable to destroy each other if they crossed paths.</p>
<p>Some primitive tribes considered doomspheres so terrible as to be worthy of worship. On occasion, a doomsphere would even provide aid to its worshipers.</p>
