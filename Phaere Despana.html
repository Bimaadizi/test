<p>Phaere Despana was a drow fighter and cleric of Lolth and the daughter of Matron Mother Ardulace , the head of the Ust Natha branch of the Despana house.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Earlier in her life, she'd had genuine feelings for the male drow called Solaufein , but such feelings had been driven from her by a love of torture. Their former love affair turned into empty bitterness.</p>
<p>She was, unsurprisingly, plotting to overthrow her mother.</p>
<p>Irenicus stole the eggs of the the dragon Adalon and gave them to Matron Mother Ardulace, who intended to sacrifice them to a demon in exchange for its aid. Gorion's Ward and party may have elected to infiltrate Ust Natha, disguised as drow, in order to help Adalon retrieve her eggs. One of the first assignments given to them by the drow was to accompany Solaufein in ambushing a group of ethereally traveling illithid , who had captured Phaere.</p>
<p>After that, Phaere gave Gorion's Ward's party and Solaufein a number of tasks. It became evident to the outsiders that there was tension between Phaere and Solaufein, and the story behind it. Eventually, Phaere would ask them to kill Solaufein (which they might choose to only pretend to do) and potentially seduce male members of the party.c</p>
<p>Next, Phaere would present them with her plot to overthrow Matron Mother Ardulace: she intended to have them swap the dragon's eggs for fakes, and offer the demon the real ones once it had killed Ardulace. If Solaufein was still alive, he would appear with further fake eggs to give to Phaere, which would mean that both women would be killed when the demon was summoned.</p>
