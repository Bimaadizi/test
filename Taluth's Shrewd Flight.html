<p>Taluth's Shrewd Flight was the store that dealt in bow -making and fletching, located in Mosstone of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Taluth's was angled on the crossing of Sairnor Street and the southern end of Fallowfern Lane , next to a nondescript hot-bun shop.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Taluth's Shrewd Flight offered a small selection of the finest quality. Bows, bowstrings , hundreds of various masterfully crafted quivers , and sturdy arrow shafts could be found in the store at all times. Even though the prices were quite high, they were more than fair for the supreme quality the store offered. Oftentimes, merchants who traveled along the Trade Way purchased several bundles of Taluth's arrows, knowing that they sold at a good profit further along the trade route.</p>
<p>Taluth's stock was crafted using wood from a grove outside of Mosstone, not far to the east. Locals gossiped about Nhalbert Taluth having elven magic that allowed him to grow quality and straight saplings.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nhalbert Taluth was the store's proprietor in the mid-to-late-14 th century DR . He honed his skill with a bow during his time serving as the archer captain of Cormyr and following that - as a mercenary marksman. He faced a forced retirement after losing a leg under a racing wagon. Nhalbert retired to the quaint town of Mosstone and opened a store. He started by making arrows and later expanded to selling bows and bowstrings.</p>
