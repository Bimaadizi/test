<p>Laothan was a language spoken by the Laothan tribe and the Seng people of Laothan in Malatra .</p>
<p>When the Laothan tribes came into contact with neighboring civilizations, they borrowed words and phrases for concepts and things they as yet had no words for. Most of these came from the T'u Lung language , but as the Laothan pronunciation deviated significantly from the norm, it was almost impossible for T'u Lung speakers to recognize them.</p>
