<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , following the request of her son Arclath Delcastle , Marantine agreed to house Amarune Whitewave and Elminster Aumar 's party in her house for a time. She also told them about the Imprisoners and the creation of the blueflame ghosts , which she knew of thanks to her family dealings with the church of Mystra .</p>

In the fighting, Lady Marantine was fatally injured. She died soon after seeing her son a final time.</p>
