<p>The furnace wagon was an experimental non-magical self-propelled wagon developed by Nadul Da Roni .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nadul's device was a coal furnace placed atop a small wagon, which used the mechanical power of hot air for propulsion. The furnace's heated air turned a low- geared fan, which connected to the rear axle and pushed the vehicle along. The wagon could not pull itself up inclines of more than 5 degrees, and required 200 pounds (91 kilograms) of coal fuel for eight hours of operation. It could carry a total of 400 pounds (180 kilograms) of weight (half of which was the fuel).</p>
<p>There was a decent chance of the furnace wagon spontaneously exploding while in operation, though Nadul had only heard of one person dying from it and considered it a negligible risk. For those afraid of fire, he invented the hand wagon .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Special orders for many Da Roni inventions could be placed at Aurora's Whole Realms Shop . The furnace wagon was valued at 150 gp .</p>
