<p>Isair was a cambion wizard who lead the Legion of the Chimera , along with his sister Madae , during the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Isair was described to be a twisted sorcerer with as much power as any master of the Host Tower of the Arcane .</p>
<p>Being half- elf and half- devil , Isair had typical elven and devilish characteristics. He was about six and a half feet tall, and stood on two legs. He had dark red skin, broad, leathery wings, twisted legs, and a tail. Isair was a powerful wizard with fighter training, and fought off his enemies with two large scimitars .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Little of Isair's equipment was known. Upon his defeat, his body was dragged into the Limbo Plane, and his equipment with him. It was most likely that Isair carried a greater version of Iyachtu Xvim 's scimitar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Isair and his twin sister, Madae , were born in the a small house, to the west of Kuldahar 's watchtower , in 1282 DR . With the archdruid Iselore 's help, they were born to an elf, Ilmadia , who had become pregnant with the devil, Belhifet . He was named after Iselore's father. To his mother's surprise, he was born with twisted legs. After the villages revolted against them, he and his sister escaped to Luskan . Here, they made contact with Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood , and became emissaries to the Abyssal Plane.</p>
<p>The twins met their father upon their maturity and fought for him in the Nine Hells , but still received discrimination. Therefore, the two returned to Faerûn . Isair and his sister were disgusted about they way they were treated for being half-breeds. Due to this, he and Madae went to form the Legion of the Chimera circa 1306 DR , their motivation being equality for half-breeds. After they were disrespected by the Ten Towns , Isair did not find it endearing, and sent his armies out to war.</p>
<p>Later in 1312 DR , he and Madae were confronted by an adventuring band and fought them in a raging battle. After their stronghold, Severed Hand , collapsed, he was dragged into the plane of Limbo , and had not been reported back since.</p>
