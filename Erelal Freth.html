<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR Erelal ordered the imprisonment and torture of Hatchrin Alet'taz , the father of her undorn child, following the accusation of a plot to poison the unborn child after childbirth (in truth, this was a false accusation planted by Drivvin).</p>
<p>In her military campaign, after a series of very devastating battles against the minotaurs , Erelal ordered Drivvin to resolve the matter after Lolth said to her that the key to her conquest was the Troglodyte Warrens . Meanwhile, Erelal welcomed Tendra Nightblade and Mateen Shadowdusk , emissaries from Shadowdusk Hold , who offered an alliance. Erelal was very nervous, having heard about various defeats. Eventually, she would concede anything in order to save herself and the next child.</p>
