<p>The Whitkeep Hostel was a large manor house found in Baldur's Gate that served a number of purposes throughout its existence. Throughout the years it was a private residence, a squatter's pad, and, during the later 15 th century DR , a gnomish artists' commune.</p>
<p>It became a gathering place for social progressives and creative-minded folks of all races.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The hostel was quite spacious, with 37 separate single-room apartments.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The manor originally belonged to a rich caravan master who lost their riches following a number of devastating monster attacks. After their fall from wealth, the building was taken over by a group of squatters.</p>
<p>By the early 15 th century, the hostel began to attract people similar to its current residents.</p>
