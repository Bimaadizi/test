<p>Princess Marabaldia was the daughter of a powerful fomorian royal family of the Underdark beneath the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was said to be the most beautiful fomorian maiden of her time, although this meant little to anyone who was not a fomorian as she was still a giant with purple, wart-covered skin and a distinctive fomorian "evil eye" which was budging and glowed yellow. However, such was the strength of her character that even those who saw her as ugly would occasionally glimpse a fleeting sense of how fomorians saw her.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Marabaldia was merciful, modest, and discreet, and she conducted herself with tact and polite formality. She was gentle and fiercely loyal to her friends, and feared that her non-fomorian friends might think that they only liked her because of the magic of her eye. She could be awkward and distant around those she loved.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Her "evil eye" allowed her to alter the perceptions and slow the thoughts of those she gazed upon, although she protested against characterizing it as a "weapon". Those who saw their reflections in her eye were also prone to self-reflection.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She regarded the gnome Suka as a close and important friend, although one whom she was prone to treat more like a child than an equal. Following the trials they endured together, she had become very fond of a song that Suka would sing, an overly melancholy tune called Oh, Father Dear . As fomorian royalty, Marabaldia had long benefitted from the enslavement of other races, especially gnomes, but she did not seem to question this or to recognize how this made Suka uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She bore a great anger at the le Shay rulers of Sarifal : at Prince Araithe for betraying her and at the High Lady Ordalf for imprisoning her for a decade.</p>
<p>She deeply loved her childhood sweetheart, Ughoth , who was a prince of a rival tribe. They shared a juvenile love: the pair were awkward together and never consummated their relationship before his untimely death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Marabaldia was the daughter of one of nine powerful royal families who ruled the fomorian tribes in the Underdark beneath the Winterglen forest on Gwynneth, but her father abandoned her when she was very young, leaving her to be raised by her mother. Growing up, she was renown for her beauty and her musical and artistic talents. She would eventually fall in love with Ughoth, a young fomorian from a different tribe. While her mother acquiesced to their desire to wed, and a date was set for the wedding, it was at that time that her father reentered her life to insist that she marry a different bridegroom, one who was rich but old and ugly. Marabaldia and Ughoth fled, and after may close calls, managed to escape to the surface. They emerged in the cellars beneath Citadel Umbra , where they were welcomed by the le Shay prince of Sarifal, Araithe. However, he soon betrayed them, imprisoning Marabaldia and selling Ughoth to the fomorians pursuing them. She was subsequently sent south to a hidden prison beneath Caer Corwell . Unbeknownst to her, the le Shay used her as a hostage to extract concessions from the fomorians relating to the Pact of Eschatos .</p>
<p>Marabaldia was kept in a dark, cramped cell of iron bars that was specially designed such that some bars could be removed to adjoin her cell to another cage. High Lady Ordalf, in her cruelty, would place her enemies in this cage and slowly starve Marabaldia over a tenday as the bars were gradually removed in an attempt to force her to kill and eat her fellow prisoners. She kept track of the passing years with tick marks on her wall.</p>
<p>After ten years in this jail, having never even been given a change of clothes, she escaped in the late 1470s DR with the help of fellow prisoners, the lycanthrope Poke and the gnome Suka. Symbolically, Marabaldia claimed one of the iron bars from her cell as a weapon. During their escape, they were accosted by Prince Ariathe himself, who made grand and empty overtures of apology to Marabaldia, claiming that her imprisonment had been a misunderstanding and a mistake. Meanwhile, he attempted to use his magic to compel Suka to kill Marabaldia with a crossbow and have an enslaved cyclops named Borgol kill Suka, thus allowing him to focus on capturing his true target, Poke, to interrogate her about the whereabouts of her mistress, Amaranth . However, Marabaldia saw through this scheme and used the power of her evil eye to help Suka break Ariathe's control. The trio brought down Araithe, but despite having him at her mercy, Marabaldia insisted that they spare him (despite Suka's protests). They fled from the ruins of Caer Corwell, but were set upon by Araithe's drow mercenaries. They were only saved by the intervention of Captain Rurik of the Winterglen Claw and Lord Mindarion of Synnoria , who recognized Marabaldia and greeted her as a princess. Unfortunately, both Poke and Borgol lost their lives to the drow as the group fled Caer Corwell.</p>
<p>The group journeyed to Harrowfast in the Cambro Mountains above Synnoria where a burgeoning alliance was being negotiated between the humans of the Winterglen Claw, the Llewyrr elves of the Knights of Synnoria , and the fomorians of the nine tribes. To her shock, she discovered that her father was dead and the armies of the nine tribes had been united and were now led by her former lover, Ughoth, with whom she tentatively renewed her courtship. As she was still recognized as a fomorian princess, Marabaldia participated in the negotiations, although she was largely ignored by the haughty Llewyrr. The alliance soon broke down following a violent outbreak between some of the elves against Rurik and Suka, which then led to violence between the fomorians and elves as Marabaldia chose to protect her friend. Despite recognizing that Suka was perhaps at fault in the altercation, Marabaldia showed no outward blame against her small friend, even after Ughoth succumbed to wounds he received in the fighting.</p>
<p>Marabaldia and her fomorian followers fled north through the Underdark, where they encountered two of Suka's allies, Lukas and Gaspar-shen , as well as Lady Amaranth, all of whom were being pursued by the army of Prince Araithe. Despite Marabaldia's grim willingness to battle the prince again, Amaranth parlayed with him to allow the rest to escape. Suka would then leave Gwynneth with Lukas and Gaspar-shen.</p>
