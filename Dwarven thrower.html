<p>Dwarven throwers , not to be confused with dwarven throwers crafted by elves , were enchanted dwarven warhammers that, once thrown, returned to the owner's hand.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Even though they varied in design, the bold geometric shapes were the most commonly seen among dwarven-made arms. Some of these mighty weapons were able to produce hum or whine when in flight. This sound was referred to as "singing" by the stout smiths.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Dwarven throwers' enchantments made them only usable by dwarves. These hefty weapons possessed a +3 enchantment but were also ensorcelled to be especially devastating to their much-hated giant opponents. When a dwarven thrower was hurled at an opponent, it instantly returned to the thrower's hand after crashing into its target, after uttering the hammer's command word , unique to each weapon. Dwarven throwers could be turned as far as 280 feet (85 meters).</p>
<p>When non-dwarves wielded these hammers, they appeared to function as simple +2 enchanted weapons with no boomerang magic active.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1368 DR , one such dwarven thrower could be purchased from a human merchant in the town of Trademeet in Amn .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , one of these magic hammers could be found in the abandoned mines of Tyar-Besil .</p>
