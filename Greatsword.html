<p>Greatswords were a type of two-handed, martial sword .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A derivative of the longsword , the greatsword was the largest member of the sword family, requiring two hands to wield it. The hilt was elongated to accommodate this extra grip and the blade was doubled-edged. Some versions had parrying hooks ( Parierhaken ) on their blade, about 4‒8 in (0.1‒0.2 m) away from the guard. The blades were typically dull between their parrying hooks and guard so that they could be gripped there.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Due to their size and weight greatswords required a good deal of training in order to wield effectively. Thus, they were classified as a martial weapon. Greatswords with parrying hooks could be gripped with one hand between the hooks and the guard, and the other on the hilt, allowing the weapon to be used in a pole arm fashion. The greatsword was generally recognized by adventurers as a reliable, powerful weapon.</p>
