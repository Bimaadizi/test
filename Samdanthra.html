<p>Samdanthra was a cook and servant who worked in the Castle Obarskyr of Suzail circa 1348 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Samdanthra served meals to the Court Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana , often in the Unicorn Chamber of the castle. The food was served despite Vangerdahast often forgetting to eat and neglecting his nutrition while working on the security of the crown. Laspeera Inthr√© , the Warden of Cormyr 's War Wizards and Vangerdahast's assistant, occasionally had to threaten him to eat Samdanthra's dishes, even if Laspeera herself had to stand over the Royal Magician with a bullwhip .</p>
