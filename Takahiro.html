<p>Takahiro was a shogun of Wa who ruled around 1640 ( 1222 DR ).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1630s, Takahiro forgave Eiji Toda , the young and inexperienced daimyo of Aru Province , for failing to stop the resurgent bandit attacks that devastated the pilgrim trains traveling to Aru . Then, in 1640 ( 1222 DR ), a foreign raiding party (possibly from Shou Lung ) made it to Aru's outskirts and razed part of the Eta District. This failure was too great and Takahiro removed Eiji from office.</p>
