<p>Eaglach was a traditional dwarven stew with its name, if translated from Dwarvish , likely scaring those unfamiliar with dwarven food.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite being a traditional dwarvish dish, eaglach occasionally had variations on the recipe. One such variant was printed in a popular cooking chapbook The Purged Palate in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . The author's secret ingredient was drider venom added in after the alcohol was boiled away. The author warned the readers to avoid using the venom in the recipe, substituting it with a safer sour ingredient. The author discovered the ingredient by accident during his days as a city watchman. A drow thief poisoned a bowl of eaglach, resulting in a delicious new recipe.</p>
