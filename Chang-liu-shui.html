<p>Chang-liu-shui , or Inexhaustible Spring Halt , was a small town located on the Spice Road on the Plain of Horses .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This oasis could be found between the Merket Depression and the Ni-Ko Oasis .</p>
<p>The actual well was found beneath a lone willow tree near a muddy pond. Water from the well was drawn from a clean underground river. The constant supply of water from the river, which allowed it to never dry out, even in the worst heats, spawned the nickname of Inexhaustible Spring Halt.</p>
<p>A small house, half buried in the ground, was located near the pond. Altho Farambler , a halfing from Faer√ªn , had setup a small business here by 1359 DR , often selling water to travelers.</p>
