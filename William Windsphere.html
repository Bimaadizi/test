<p>William Windsphere was the bartender of the Old Man's Face inn in the village of Tyrluk in the kingdom of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-1480s DR , William had given the key to his tavern to the innkeeper of the Old Man's Face, Branson Blackboot , in case he locked himself outside the tavern. William's tavern was visited by the Cormyrean adventurer-noble Oriphaun Huntsilver , who hid a fragment of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll at the Old Man's Face by scribbling a promise of payment for services rendered on the blank side of the scroll, which William pinned up in the taproom amid other receipts and notes. Soon after, an army of sellswords led by Netherese wizards came down the High Road and broke into the inn in search of it. While William hid himself in a crate in the tavern basement, Branson locked himself in his office, where he stayed until adventurers who were also searching for the scroll fragment arrived. When the mercenaries were killed, Branson gave the adventurers a key to the barn, where he kept the tavern key that they used to rescue William and retrieve the scroll fragment.</p>
