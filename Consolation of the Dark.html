<p>Consolation of the Dark was an introductory Sharran text, penned in or before the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Consolation of the Dark claimed that amongst other gods, only Shar was honest and direct, not dispensing shallow promises and false claims. Shar's promise to bring the Eternal darkness was a promise of curing all pain. As such, all followers of Sharran dogma were to bring pain and suffering in order to help others understand their deity and that her promise of darkness was a promise of kindness.</p>
