<p>On a warm day in Mirtul in the Year of the Missing Blade, 759 DR , the group Folossan was with ran into a Netherese tomb.

<p>Later, it turned out that Amandarn had gambled all their money away shortly afterward; Folossan nearly killed him for it. The two stole back some of their coin, got caught, and fled. After spending the evening under an altar to Mystra , they found a small fortune and a deed to a castle by morning, which they presented to the rest of the team. Iyriklaunavan magically verified their account, but Nuressa only found out in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , during the bout of chaos of The Art that year.</p>
