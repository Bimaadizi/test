<p>The Master Thief's Hideout was the palatial home of Karissa the Knife , Master Thief of the Night Brigade , in Wheloon Prison during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The hideout was shockingly luxurious compared to the ruins of Wheloon Prison, as Karissa stole anything and everything that she desired. She had the regular entrance barricaded shut, ensuring that the only visitors who could make it in were those that traversed the lengthy gauntlet of tunnels attached to the building. These tunnels were a mix of pre-existing constructions (including the sewers ) connected by fresh rough excavations delved by Karissa's team. The tunnels were well-guarded by her followers and an elaborate array of traps , making it impossible to find let alone reach the hideout.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Master Thief Karissa used her home as base for her "guild" of thieves, and stored her ill-gotten treasures there.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Riverside Rats fought back against the Night Brigade, Neese the Burrower attempted to take down their Master Thief. She lost many scouts trying to find the hideout, and so hired outsiders to take the lead. They managed to cut through the defenses and eventually found Karissa in her palace, cornering and killing her.</p>
