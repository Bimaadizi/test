<p>Mercer was the chamberlain of Lady Jannath's Estate in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chamberlain Mercer was an aged rock gnome man with a light skin tone, dark eyes, and black curly hair. He wore a fanciful set of embroidered clothes and a top hat â€“ a chamberlain's uniform of the Jannath Estate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Mister Mercer was in charge of the help that served Lady Firelia Jannath in her mansion. When her new husband fell victim of a ghostly possession, Mercer dismissed all servants from the mansion on the mistress's orders, leaving only her loyal butler Tarhun Mnemonis standing guard of the mansion's main entrance. Mercer placed Furbleston , Bailey , Cyrilla , Jooli , Phubbs , and Chef Marjoram on temporary leave with the pay of half-wages and allowance to seek temporary employment somewhere else. The chamberlain issued a statement that this dismissal was done at no imputation of malfeasance and would be ended upon notice.</p>
