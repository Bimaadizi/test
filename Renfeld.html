<p>Renfeld was a member of the Harpers who clandestinely operated in the City of Coin, Athkatla in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Renfeld was ambushed on the streets of Athkatla. His assailants injected him with fast-acting poison ; luckily, a group of adventurers led by Abdel Adrian walked in on the attack. However, they were too late to stop the poisoning. Renfeld was unable to move and already had attempted to unsuccessfully neutralize poison . The man asked the adventurers to bring his dying body to a large building in Athkatla's Wave District , the Galvarey Estate , secretly a Harper safehouse. His Harper allies could cure the affliction, but Renfeld needed to be taken there post haste. It was unknown if Abdel Adrian managed to deliver the dying man to the Harper agent Rylock in time to save his fleeting life.</p>
