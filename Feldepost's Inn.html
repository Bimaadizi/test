<p>Feldepost's Inn was an old establishment located in the town of Beregost on the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 th and late 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>It was a quiet, comfortable inn that was a favorite among the elderly.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The staff here was careful, considerate, and polite, though service did tend to be slow as a result. Except during days of warmer weather, each room provided a lit fire for the comfort of its guest. Every patron who booked a room was treated to a drawn bath, with water to the temperature of their choosing. Attendants were a handful of kindly old men who said little, but aided customers with bathing if they so requested. This made it appealing to the aged and infirm.</p>
<p>The inn hired entertainers such as minstrels, but could not pay them as well as the Jovial Juggler .</p>
<p>In the 1480s DR, folk in Beregost liked to start the day with a quiet meal and casual conversation at Feldepost's Inn, making it popular in the mornings.</p>
<h3>Food and Drink</h3>
<p>The food served in Feldepost's was quite superior to that found in other establishments. Dishes included such highlights as cheese -and- cucumber buns and mushroom tarts , which were on the house with the purchase of beverages. These were served by the fireplace in the evenings. A fine sherry was also available; this was stored in the cellar. Meals were warm and hearty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This old inn drew its name from its founder and first owner, who died sometime before 1366 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the mage Tranzig stayed at the inn, while acting as an intermediary between the bandit-captain Tazok and the Cyricist cleric Mulahey . When confronted by Abdel Adrian , he attacked his party and was killed. Meanwhile, one of the patrons was Marl , a farmer whose son became an adventurer and was killed; he got drunk and got into an argument with visiting adventurers. Another drunken patron was Gyllian . A wealthy guest known as Algernon also stayed there.</p>
<p>The inn remained in business in the late 1400s DR. One morning in the 1480s DR, the peaceful morningfeast was disrupted by the pseudodragon familiar Hsing , who met some adventurers and enlisted them to search for his mistress SEER in the ruins of the Ulcaster School of Wizardry .</p>
