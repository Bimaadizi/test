<p>Stug Minedale was hired thug who was hired to break knees by Uktar , the bursar of the Guild in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stug was a gold dwarf with a brown skin tone, brown eyes, and brown hair with a bushy beard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Stug offered his knee-breaking services to the Guild as a reminder of the coin owed by its many debtors. Despite his unsavory occupation, his family member, Gherva Minedale , offered the thug the opportunity to join the Vigilant Knights order of lawful and goodly warriors on one condition â€“ Stug was to stop beating people up for the Guild. This posed a dilemma that the two discussed over a drink or ten at the Elfsong Tavern in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. Stug insisted that he had already taken the money from Uktar for beating someone up, and going back on the agreement was akin to oath-breaking. Gherva, however, remained stern, stating that if he were to do that job for the Guild, Stug could kiss the Vigilant Knights membership goodbye. Eventually, Stug agreed to return Uktar's coin but was afraid that his own knees would be broken as a result.</p>
