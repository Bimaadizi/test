<h2>History</h2>
<p>Laeron was interred in his tomb with a number of other undead and servitors, including wheeps , quells , skeletons , and tomb guardian constructs. Around the time of the Darkening in the late 15 th century DR , the adventurers Jarus Brithandir , Kirina Aelorothi , Tristran of Daggerford , Popkin Shortshanks , Helayna , and Liantor Stoneborn discovered the tomb and cut their way through a few of the guardians before finding a passage hidden behind Laeron's throne. The adventurers passed deeper underground into natural caverns below the tomb, and by the time Laeron was up and about they were long gone. A second wave of invaders arrived to rescue the first group, and while Laeron and his minions put up a strong fight he was destroyed.</p>
