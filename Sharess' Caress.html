<p>Sharess' Caress was a festhall located on Wyrm's Crossing in the Outer City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Sharess' Caress stood on the eastern side of Wyrm's Crossing – the bridge that connected Rivington and the Twin Songs neighborhoods of the Outer City , just past the checkpoint gate that allowed entrance to the bridge, across the street from Fraygo's Flophouse .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The festhall was a structure of three stories and one sub-level. It opened into a thin taproom filled with seats at the bar, the hostess counter, and several booths. The taproom had one stair up to the second and third floors and two stairs to the sub-level – the kitchen and its large larder to the left from the entrance and a curtained entertainment chamber with a stage and musical instruments. The second and third floors had more seating and tables available for the guests, and the third floor expanded across the bridge to the western side and housed several thematic lodgings where guests met similarly thematic escorts .</p>
<p>The second entrance into the festhall was accessible from the bridge's walkways that overlooked the cliffs and the River Chionthar on the opposite side of the building. The walkway had several tables available to customers who preferred fresh river air to perfumes and incense of Sharess .</p>
<p>The "Nymph's Grotto" room was decorated in a sylvan manner and had a sizable bath. "Elminster's Library" was styled after a wizard 's lair. The "Underdark Pleasures" room was quite self-explanatory. And lastly, "Devil's Den" was a lavish and splendorous room fit to satisfy some of the most posh devils.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Mamzell Amira , the festhall's proprietress, sought investigators who would be interested in seeking out the coinlass named Ffion Goldgrind , better known as the "Stern Librarian," who disappeared and left her clients' bookings unattended. Ffion fell victim to the Murder Tribunal cultists of Bhaal , and her body was discovered next door at Fraygo's Flophouse. During the same time, one special consort took residence in the festhall's "Devil's Den." This suave individual was Raphael , who used the room to forge infernal contracts rather than offering sexual favors.</p>
