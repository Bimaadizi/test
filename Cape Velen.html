<p>Cape Velen was a lightly-populated duchy in Tethyr ruled in 1369 DR by Duke Llachior Blackthorn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Cape Velen encompassed the Dragon's Neck Peninsula , which was also called the Velen Peninsula or the Tethyr Peninsula. Most of the settled land was on the coast; the interior of the peninsula was forested and connected to the Forest of Tethir to the east.</p>
<p>This duchy contained the counties of Firedrake , Fyraven , and Greenshores .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Duke Llachior Blackthorn ruled the Cape from castle Tordraken .</p>
<p>After the successful succession from Tethyr, Duke Calchais rules over the small now independent duchy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The founding clans of Tethyr originated in this part of the country.</p>
<p>The coast of Cape Velen was struck by an immense tidal wave on Midsummer Night in the Year of Silent Screams, −133 DR . The flooding killed a large percentage of the population of the peninsula, including all the members of Clan Tarseth , and destroyed the city of Velen .</p>
<p>In 1424 DR they declared their independence from the Tethyr and became an autonomous duchy. Velen had become isolated from the rest of Tethyr due to the founding of Muranndin which cut off their land-based routes of travel to the larger kingdom. Initially this created tension with Tethyr, but over time relations between the two realms were re-established and they considered one another as allies.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>Cape Velen was said to have been infested with ghosts. The people living there, however, did not seem much bothered by this.</p>
<p>By 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.</p>
