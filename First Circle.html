<p>The First Circle was a loose pantheon of the gods of nature worshiped by the druids as of the late 15th century DR . Their name was meant to convey that they were "first among the druids". Veneration of the First Circle was sometimes called the Old Ways .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The circle was traditionally made up of Auril , Chauntea , Eldath , Malar , Mielikki , Silvanus , Talos , and Umberlee , although many druids also regarded Beshaba and Grumbar as members. These gods collectively represented the many facets of nature—from its majesty to its violence and cruelty—and were honored for their parts in natural cycles of creation and destruction, growing and withering, or life and death. Each god was further regarded not simply as a divine being, but as an embodiment of the natural forces or phenomena which they represented. For example, Malar was synonymous with the hunger and instinct of predators, while Grumbar was synonymous with rolling hills and fertile soil.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>While any given druid circle might worship just some of the gods of the First Circle, most druids counted them all as worthy of veneration. Rangers who worked alongside druids also commonly worshiped the First Circle.</p>
<p>While druids traditionally gathered in places of nature that were isolated from the uninitiated to honor the First Circle, temples and shrines were increasingly common by the late 15 th century DR. First Circle priests tended to be on good terms with groups like the Uthgardt tribes.</p>
