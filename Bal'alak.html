<p>Bal'alak , or Balalak the Ferocious , was a massive dire boar that terrorized the inhabitants of Samargol in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bal'alak was truly a massive fierce creature of foul temper that almost dared hunters to test their mettle. The boar's arched back was as tall if not taller than an adult human . Bal'alak's head and back were protected by natural spiny armor. Its face was adorned with great gleaming tusks and demon eyes that exuded malice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Bal'alak became a major danger to the simple folk of Samarach . The local hunters failed numerous times to bring the beast down, and even a hefty bounty on Bal'alak could not stop the giant boar. A tiefling merchant, Vadin'ya of Samargol, offered an especially generous reward for Bal'alak's tusks, which, according to her, held great magical power.</p>
<p>Sister huntresses from Tashluta , Inshula sar Mashewe and Kwesi sar Mashewe , attempted to hunt down the giant boar but barely escaped with their lives as Kwesi was injured by the beast.</p>
