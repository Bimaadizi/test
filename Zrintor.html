<p>Zrintor , also known as the Viper Forest , was a region on Rauwend, the 45 th layer of the Abyss that was populated by viper trees .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located somewhere along the banks of the River of Salt , Zrintor was a salty marsh pockmarked by pits of " quicksalt ". A road passed through it leading to the city of Zelatar . The forest was devoid of animal life due to the viper trees which attacked and ate most anything that wandered into the forest.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere</h2>
<p>The 45 th layer of the Abyss was a gloomy place where the sunlight was similar to that during an eclipseâ€”muted. Sights and sounds were also muted throughout this layer, making details difficult to notice in the grayness. Being stealthy was easier here, with plenty of shadows to hide in and inadvertent noises absorbed. On the other hand, it was easier to be surprised by a sneak attack for the same reasons.</p>
