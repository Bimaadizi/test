<p>Woto Jubojiro was an old bushi in Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jubojiro was a soldier in the army of Matasuuri Nagahide . One day, during the suppression of a korobokuru insurrection, his platoon was ambushed and destroyed, and only Jubojiro survived by escaping into a cave. There he freed a bee from a spider's web and later in a dream the bee showed him defeating the korobokuru leading a bee swarm.</p>
<p>Jubojiro believed he had a sure position in Nagahide's army but, around 1346 DR , after becoming shogun , Nagahide reorganized the army, firing many bushi, among them Jubojiro. Therefore, he started a new life as a beekeeper near Juzimura but over time developed a resentment against the shogunate for their preference for younger bushi in command positions. He wanted to retaliate.</p>
