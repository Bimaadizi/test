<p>House Alenuath was a moon elf house on Evermeet .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The house was established by the legendary Haramara Alenuath, who reputedly killed the red dragon Skarra with a single arrow shot from her bow.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Its members were typically rangers , hunters, or others who spent a great deal of time alone, which their sun elf neighbors thought unusual. The house members were often to be found scattered across Evermeet on their adventures.</p>
<p>As of 1368 DR , the house was led by Thalanil Alenuath .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Although the house had a small manse in Leuthilspar adorned in the family's colors, it was often unoccupied for extended periods. It was cared for by the mostly moon elf servants. As they could more-or-less do as they liked during these times, they thought the Alenuaths to be good employers.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Haramara's bow was a non-magical bow that had great significance in the house. It was held by the house's leader.</p>
<p>The house's colors were gray and green.</p>
