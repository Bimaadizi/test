<p>Bombasto was a barbarian patron of the Elfsong Tavern from the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bombasto was a middle-aged human man with a tanned skin tone. He had blue eyes, a bushy braided light brown beard, and a clean-shaven head. His face and scalp were decorated with simple geometric lines and designed tattoos . He wore a simple set of barbarian clothes and a massive greataxe .</p>
<h2>Posessions</h2>
<p>Bombasto carried a journal written in large and loose handwriting, collecting memories of Bombasto's adventuring and juvenile pranks.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Bombasto's traveling companion was Dame Guisarme , with whom he seemed to have a flirtatious and friendly-antagonistic relationship. She thought the barbarian's schemes and ideas were crazy but ended up getting involved in them anyway, but not before receiving a compliment from Bombasto and responding to it with a slap.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Bombasto was a frequent customer of the Elfsong Tavern in the Eastway neighborhood of Baldur's Gate. He was often seen dining or enjoying drinks with his mercenary adventuring companion, Dame Guisarme.</p>
<p>One of Bombasto's adventures was his and Dame Guisarme's stand against hobgoblin raiders who held a wagonload of beer . Bombasto was thirsty and suggested the adventurers trade a wagonload of donkey shit for the hobgoblins' beer. Despite Dame Guisarme considering the idea crazy, Bombasto went on pushing a wagon of manure off a hill. It rolled down and pushed the hobgoblins' cart of beer forward, slaying in its place. Guisarme grabbed the beer wagon down in a ravine.</p>
<p>During their time at the Elfsong Tavern, Bombasto and Guisarme contemplated accepting a job in East Chult , guarding extractive safari out of Fort Beluarian with bonuses paid to all survivors.</p>
