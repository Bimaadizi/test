<p>Wire was a manufactured length of flexible metal, a "coiled good" alongside chain and rope . It was extremely useful and in wide demand across the Realms for everything from common tools to fancy jewelry to elaborate mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Wire was often quite brittle and soft from the drawing process, making it quite easy to snap under the right circumstances. Bending wire more than once in the same spot could snap it, and most wire produced was quite thick to ensure its durability.</p>
<p>Hard metals and alloys could respond poorly to being drawn into wire and become more fragile, while softer metals such as gold were the easiest to draw into fine wire. Adamant in particular was difficult to draw into wire because of its extreme brittleness, and had to be alloyed with molybdenum to make it usable.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Most blacksmiths could make relatively thick wire as needed, but thinner and more delicate wire was much rarer. Crafted by wiredrawers, the expertise and tools required to make good fine wire made it harder to come by in much of Faerûn compared to rope and chain, with the centers of such production found in the Calimshan and Tashalar regions. In many human communities, urban gnome and dwarf artisans pioneered fine wire and chain crafting, and gnomes in particular led the development of increasingly thin and flexible wire that could be used for everyday purposes.</p>

<h3>Spell Components</h3>
<p>A great number of spells used various forms of wire as material components , especially those involving communication and thought.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Thread-of-gold was an exceptionally fine wire made by ancient dwarves , though the process of crafting it was long lost to modern dwarves.</p>
<p>Wire was made by the ancient human peoples of Faerûn, including the Rengarth of Netheril thousands of years before 0 NY (−3859 DR) , and by the people of Calimshan by -6048 DR .</p>
<p>The consistent production of fine wire in Faerûn was still a developing art by the mid–14 th century DR , as artisans continued to gradually refine the process over time. It was expected to still be an area of experimentation and notable improvements through to the mid–16 th century DR.</p>
<p>Cable—rope woven around wire—was first developed around the mid-14 th century DR.</p>
