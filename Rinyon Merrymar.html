<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , goods meant for Merrymar's Merchandise were raided on the road by bandits, thought to be orcs of the High Forest . Tragically, Blaz and Rinyon lost not only merchandise but also all four of their sons and three of their nephews, leaving the extended family decimated and the store understaffed. Rinyon and her two daughters were left to run it alone while Blaz went on the road as a merchant.</p>
