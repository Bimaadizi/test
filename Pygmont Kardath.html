<p>Pygmont Kardath was a farmer in the town of Ghars in Cormyr in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He and his wife were both rather overweight, she more than him.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>The Kardaths lived in a farmhouse southwest of Ghars, about 0.25 miles (400 meters) from a fork in the swamp road.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Jasper sighted the ghost of the bandit chieftain Fastred whilst riding home on the night of Eleint 16 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , he fled in fear and the Kardath farmhouse was the first he came to after recovering his wits. Though they may have thought him simply hysterical and inebriated, they gave him hot tea and cake, listened to his tale, asked if they could help somehow, and even offered to let him stay the night, though Jasper declined and went on his way.</p>
