<p>Magebanes were small, flighted creatures who fed of magical energies. They were infamous in Faerûn for harrying mages and ruining their spellcasting, much to their chagrin.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures resembled bats with somewhat amorphous bodies. They had long, barbed tails and ten spindly legs that extended from their underbellies.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Magebanes could readily detect magical auras , which served them well when searching for their next meal. They were entirely invisible and silent, except to any spellcaster they designated as their source.</p>
<p>They were immune to all forms of psionics and as such could not detect residual psionic energy .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Magebanes fed on magical energy. They would designate a "chosen" arcane spellcaster to be their "source" of food. Whenever that individual cast a spell the magebane absorbed the energy in a manner similar to a rod of absorption . These spells would either experience reduced effectiveness or fizzle out entirely.</p>
<p>They continued to follow their "chosen" mages until a more powerful source of magic made itself apparent.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Rather than using their magic-absorption method of feeding, magebanes utilized meager physical attacks in combat. They would slash at others with either their claws or pointed tails.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In Faerûn , magebanes could be found in underground areas such as caverns. They were also known to inhabit the plane of Pandemonium and possibly other outer planes .</p>
<p>The flesh of these creatures, as well as a powder made from their claws, were highly valued as an alchemical reagent. An intact magebane carcass could sell for as much as 400 gp .</p>
