<p>The old King's Road referred to the remnants of the King's Road between Valls and Bloodstone Pass in the Kingdom of Damara as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The first stretch of the road headed north from Valls in the Duchy of Arcata across dusty plains to the foothills of the Galena Mountains , and the second stretch entered the mountains at Bloodstone Pass in the Barony of Bloodstone . From there, it became a narrow and winding trail that passed directly through the Damaran Gate before joining into the main road through Bloodstone Valley to Bloodstone Village .</p>
<p>As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, the route was fairly direct and overland, passing through varied terrain including small woodlands and rocky crevasses. As of the late 15 th century DR , the route adhered more closely to the Beaumaris River , arriving on its bank just south of Darlisan and crossing the river itself at Ostrav before following it to the Pass.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The overland trade route through Bloodstone Pass declined in relevance in the early-to-mid 14 th century DR, and by the 1350s DR the stretch of the King's Road leading to the Pass was in ruins, although it was still an easier route than hiking through the wilderness.</p>
<p>Following the victory of Zhengyi the Witch-King over the forces of Damara in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the road between Bloodstone and Valls became a thoroughfare for refugees fleeing south from the Witch-King's territory, and on their heels were violent groups of bandits and displaced soldiers. During this time, some effort was made by Fredegast , the leader of the halfling militia of Waukeshire , to keep the road safe.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , the Bloodstone Wars began when Arcatan forces marched along the old King's Road to Bloodstone Pass with the intent of besieging Bloodstone Village and seizing Bloodstone Mines .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While a number of bandits prowled the road during the reign of Zhengyi, the greater threat was a mated pair of red dragons and their wyrmling who made their lair just off the road in a wooded area.</p>
