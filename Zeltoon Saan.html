<p>Zeltoon Saan was a proud Thayan Red Wizard proprietor of magic items in the city of Hillsfar circa 1373 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Zeltoon was a tall, well-built, dusky-skinned individual with a shaved head and proudly displayed scalp tattoos , as was typical for the mages of Thay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Zeltoon Saan opened a stall selling wondrous trinkets and enchanted items from the land of Thay . He was one of the very few outsiders allowed in the city during the raging Order of the Crippled Fang crisis in the late fall of that year. The Red Wizard could be found in Hillsfar's market plaza, where he quickly developed an antagonistic attitude toward a recent arrival and a fellow trader, Branon Oakheart of Silvanus . Zeltoon eyed and engaged prospective customers who appeared to have enough coin to purchase his exotic wares. Despite being a Red Wizard, Saan knew very little of the Order of the Crippled Fang, apart from the fact that it originated or had some connection to Zhentil Keep . He welcomed war as it was good for his business.</p>
