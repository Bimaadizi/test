<p>Sorenth Gorender , nicknamed Happy , was a vampire and a lower-ranked member of the Night Masters , the cabal of vampires who led the Night Masks . He was also owner and bartender of the Purple Lady festhall.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sorenth was a man with a handsome face and long, gently curling blond hair that hung to his shoulders. He loved his hair, and usually tied it in a ponytail with a ribbon in keeping with his dress that night. He almost always smiled.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sorenth maintained an air of elegance and charm, always sociable, friendly, and courteous. Even when he was angry, his manners were perfect. He thus seemed very trustworthy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sorenth was the owner and bartender of the Purple Lady , a top-quality festhall in Westgate . Even before his recruitment to the Night Masks, he was a master blackmailer, using the so-called Purple Ladies to acquire information for blackmail. The vampire Orbakh specifically chose him to be his main link to the city's criminal underworld, and made him a vampire and a Night Mask.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sorenth supervised the blackmailing operations of the guild, and collected information through the Purple Ladies. The unsuspecting upper-class patrons of the Purple Lady—mostly jaded nobles and merchants after a thrill or company above their station—grew intoxicated or infatuated with the lovely Ladies of the festhall and divulged confidences and secrets. They then became victims of Sorenth's blackmail; most paid up. The few who resisted he reported to the Twilight Knight for intimidation and beatings. Happy Sorenth avoided getting his hands dirty.</p>
<p>Thanks to his trade, nobody suspected his illicit activities or his vampiric transformation. His building was perfect for secretly meeting with this agents, who passed disguised as delivery-folk, crafts-folk, merchants, patrons, and others. The late working hours meant he could remain nocturnal. He also satiated his thirst by "drinking" from his Purple Ladies.</p>
