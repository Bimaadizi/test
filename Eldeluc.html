<p>Eldeluc ( pronounced : /ˈ ɛ l d ɛ l uːk / EL-de-luke ) was a human wizard and a member of the Arcane Brotherhood at the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was large, burly, and fat, and quite strong for a mage.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>With a friendly and jovial manner, Eldeluc seemed like a big fun guy, but this hid a deeply evil man with a tainted soul.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Because of his worship of Bane , Eldeluc had acquired connections with the Zhentarim , and later in particular members of the church of Xvim led by Fzoul Chembryl . He vehemently hated his rival and former master Dendybar the Mottled and the feeling was mutual. In turn, covert Brotherhood member Pureheartman opposed both their wicked schemes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, Eldeluc was Dendybar's apprentice, and, perhaps surprisingly for the Arcane Brotherhood, was utterly loyal to his master.</p>
<p>Eldeluc conspired with Dendybar the Mottled and other associates to have their rival Morkai the Red , the Master of the North Tower, murdered by his apprentice Akar Kessel at their command while on an expedition to Icewind Dale in the Year of the Crown, 1351 DR .</p>
<p>His removal saw both Eldeluc and Dendybar rise to key places in the Brotherhood and by the late 1350s DR, Eldeluc and Dendybar were both lieutenants of the Archmage Arcane , Arklem Greeth , marking them both as heirs-apparent. But Eldeluc's apparently easier rise through the lower ranks made Dendybar jealous and resentful. No longer loyal to his old master, Eldeluc watched his back while pitying Dendybar's new apprentice Sydney . It did not seem long until one got rid of the other.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Eldeluc, their rivalry ended when Dendybar did, when he was slain by the vengeful spirit of Morkai the Red in the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR . Eldeluc, meanwhile, apparently escaped or avoided retribution, at least so far.</p>
<p>Eventually, some time after 1367 DR , Eldeluc and fellow lieutenant Valkebar assassinated Queltar Thaeloon , the Wizard of Green Fire and the chief lieutenant of Arklem Greeth. The pair then targeted Arklem himself, ambushing him in his bedchamber at night on Eleint 14 in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR . Protected by his magic, but badly wounded, Arklem fled the Host Tower.</p>
<p>By the time Arklem returned, as a lich allied with devil , the Arcane Brotherhood was leaderless and in civil war and the Host Tower half empty. Arklem killed Eldeluc and Valkebar and regained control of the Arcane Brotherhood. However, it was suspected that Eldeluc probably kept a hidden clone of himself.</p>
