<p>Sangin was a human warlock who lived in Barovia during the 15 th century of the Faer√ªnian calendar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The warlock wore simple robes of earthen hues but adorned himself with numerous rings. He wore particularly tiny glasses ad the end of his rather large nose.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a conniving man that cared primarily for his own wellbeing. He desperately sought a way to escape Barovia, seeing others as merely a means to that end.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Sangin was at least somewhat knowledgeable about the workings of the arcane .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Like all inhabitants of Barovia were in some way, Sangin was a servant of Count Strahd von Zarovich .</p>
<p>Sangin briefly worked with a pair of werewolves Dron and Utna , who laired with their pack in a cave network near Lake Baratok .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa the 1480s DR, Sangin was dispatched along with Dron and Utna by Count Strahd to Toril on the Prime Material plane to search for a specific magical item that could allow travel away from Barovia. While away from the Domains of Dread the Sangin and the lycanthropes worked together to claim the item for themselves, as a means of escape from Strahd's ever-present and far-reaching control.</p>
<p>They tracked the item to the temple of Kelemvor in Baldur's Gate , and abducted the cleric Nerys Kathon to identify it from a group of other relics . After successfully identifying an enchanted locket that once belonged to a woman named Tatyana , Nerys withheld the information from her captors until she was rescued by the Heroes of Baldur's Gate . Unfortunately for everyone involved, Strahd tracked them down and used the mists of the Shadowfell to bring them all to his realm. Once the group was returned to Strahd's domain, Sangin was promptly carried away by a cloud of bats to Castle Ravenloft . Marked a traitor by the count, Sangin was feasted upon by three of Strahd's vampires and turned into an undead monster himself.</p>
<p>After his transformation, the vampiric Sangin was dispatched alongside his his sires to exert Strahd's control over the werewolf den, forcing the pack's leader Kiril to order the death of Dron. Bringing the werewolves along as brutish enforcers, Sangin and the vampires assailed Baron Vargas for harboring the Heroes of Baldur's Gate, enemies of Barovia. In the ensuing battle, the undead Sangin was beheaded by Utna as revenge for Dron's death.</p>
