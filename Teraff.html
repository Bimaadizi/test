<p>Teraff was a passionate, young star elf orator who, in the early days of the creation of Sildëyuir preached against peaceful relations with any other nation, even with other elves .</p>
<p>She led a group of renegade star elves on raids against coastal camps of human settlers who she suspected of spying on Yuireshanyaar . Her fears proved true when she and her group were captured by some of those coastal settlers.</p>
<p>Teraff was tortured to death for not revealing the locations of the portals to Sildëyuir or how to activate them but some of her group managed to escape capture and return home. They told of her tale and she was forever remembered as a heroine and a symbol of inspiration to the star elf people.</p>
