<p>Under his leadership the Blacktalons became a more reputable and less criminal organization.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Taurgosz and his Blacktalons worked along side the mercenaries of the Chill during the iron crisis of that year. The two groups led raids on caravans traveling along the Coast Way , delivering any iron they recovered to their overseer Tazok . While Taurgosz and the leader of the Chill believed they were working for the Zhentarim , they were in fact being used as puppets by Sarevok Anchev and the Iron Throne .</p>
