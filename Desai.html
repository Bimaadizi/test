<p>The Desai were a Bedine tribe located in Anauroch . By 1468 DR , they were nominally under the rule of Netheril .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the Spring Equinox ( Ches 19 ) in 1463 DR , Ruqiah (the reincarnated Catti-brie ) was born to Kavita and Niraj of the Desai tribe. In 1468 DR , the Shadovar agents Untaris and Alpirs De'Noutess attempted to kidnap her on behalf of Parise Ulfbinder , but Ruqiah killed them with her divine magic. Soon after, Ruqiah was forced to flee the tribe but returned regularly to gain magical training from her parents.</p>
<p>In 1468 DR , a Desai encampment of tents was located at the remains of the ancient city Rasileth .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Like other Bedine tribes, the Desai were forbidden to practice magic, but some (namely Kavita and Niraj) secretly did so anyway.</p>
<p>A typical outfit of a Desai man was a round, white cotton garment set with a large button and tassel. Like other Bedine, a Desai man wore a kufiya headscarf and an igal tie that spoke of their stature in the tribe.</p>
<p>The Desai's primary gods were N'asr , god of the dead, and At'ar the Merciless, the Yellow Goddess of the desert.</p>
<p>The discovery of a wellspring in the desert was celebrated all night long.</p>
