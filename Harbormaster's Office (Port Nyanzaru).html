<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The office was located in the Harbor Ward on the northwest corner of the harbor.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The building was airy yet sturdy. An exterior bulletin board was used to advertise approved wilderness guides for those interested in venturing into the Chultan jungles.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The harbormaster and their clerks operated out of this office. The harbormaster was responsible for managing the traffic in the Warehouse District and dealing with the hundreds of minor disputes and problems that arose each day across the Harbor Ward. Doing so frequently meant that the harbormaster was not present in the office, and so messages could be left with clerks if needed.</p>
