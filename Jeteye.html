<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jeteye was a bitter-tasting liquid with a glossy black coloring. Its walnut flavoring made it difficult to conceal in foods or drink.</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>Jeteye was poisonous if ingested. It got its name not only from its color, but also from its effects, which included the imbiber's eyes turning jet black. The other effect of jeteye was immediate damage to neural receptors, which eliminated any feelings of pain and led to the loss of tactile feeling for several minutes. Jeteye was also used as an anesthetic for severe wounds. Jeteye was effective on any mammal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jeteye was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum . It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black , during his time spent with an orc tribe in the 10 th century DR . Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists before the mid–14 th century DR.</p>
