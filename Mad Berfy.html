When Xixis risked carelessly ruining the plan, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm kill Xixis with a dagger of venom , so that the Lord's murder would cover up his kidnapping. Despite their best attempts at diversion, the Emerald Swords were caught and Lord Thistle rescued. For their murder and kidnapping, they risked exile or execution for their crimes.</p>
