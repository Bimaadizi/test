<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Pinchwit bred a herd of giant goats that provided large quantities of milk and meat. She also sold their goat hair, prized for its warmth and tensile strength.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Pinchwit worked as a goatherd for Dagult Neverember and the rebuilt town of Leilon , so her profits belonged to the town.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1491 DR , part of Pinchwit's flock was to be sold to a wealthy trader from Waterdeep for a large profit. Elmar Barthen , owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin , had negotiated the deal. The goats had to be transported from Leilon to Phandalin as part of the arrangement. The Leilon town council hired a group of adventurers to protect Pinchwit and her goats on the seven-day journey. During their travels, the goats were spooked by wyverns and had to be rounded up by Pinchwit and the adventurers. Later, the herd was attacked by a group of ogres on the prowl that the adventurers fought back. In the end, Pinchwit and her flock arrived safely at Phandalin.</p>
