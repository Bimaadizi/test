<p>The Keepers of the Flame were a monastic order of psionic duergar clerics of Laduguer who dwelled in the city of Gracklstugh in the Northdark .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>They had the duty of serving the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh, the red dragon Themberchaud , who used his fire breath to temper the legendary steel blades of the city in exchange for contributions to his hoard. They obeyed his every whim, or at least those that fell within the terms of the pact between the dragon and House Steelshadow . This included defending his hoard while he was away working at the forges. They kept him happy, rich, and fat on the city's more disobedient slaves and guarded the entrance to his lair from a nearby guardhouse, though few would dare trespass in the dragon's lair.</p>
<p>They kept Themberchaud under control through their persuasions, psionics, and appeasements, and by speaking on his behalf with others. But they also secretly had the responsibility of slaying the Wyrmsmith before he grew too strong, and of replacing him with a new and more pliable hatchling .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century, the Keepers had much influence in the city and advised Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V and aided him in thwarting the plots of the derro Council of Savants . They advised the D The Keepers' power rested on their psionics, the Deepking's authority, and their control of Themberchaud.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Keepers were caught up in a bitter feud with the Gray Ghosts thieves' guild , also based in Gracklstugh. Otherwise, they were highly respected within the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the Gray Ghosts under Zunkhasp Saltbaron stole a red dragon egg from Themberchaud's hoardâ€”it was unclear whether it was his offspring or a prize of conquest. In a rage, the Keepers declared war on the Gray Ghosts, opening hostilities between them and causing strife in the city by 1373 DR .</p>
<p>However, in the late 1400s DR, the Gray Ghosts once again stole a red dragon egg, this one intended to hatch a new Wyrmsmith, and the Keepers became distracted by their renewed war on the thieves. The Keepers captured and executed the Gray Ghost leader, but he never gave up the egg's hiding place and they were shamed by their failure. Worse still, Themberchaud, still the current Wyrmsmith, had grown stronger, restless, and more resistant to their control, and had started getting ideas of dominating the whole city for himself. In response, the Keepers refocused their security around the dragon's lair and explored other options. They hired talented mercenaries within the city, but Themberchaud too would try to recruit them as his agents, while Gartokkar would then interrogate them as to the dragon's intentions.</p>
<p>Although the Keepers also sensed the effects of a demon incursion into the Underdark at the time, but not the demons themselves, Gartokkar was convinced the Gray Ghosts were somehow behind it. He would hire a group of adventurers to follow a derro Gray Ghost agent, Droki , to locate their lair. They may even have recovered the red dragon egg, but whom they would return it to remains in question. The Keepers might also have fought an open battle with the Gray Ghosts at this time.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The Keepers trained as both psionicists and priests , or in other terms, psions and clerics . Their psionics gave them powers similar to the friends , message , and command spells, in addition to their divine spells.</p>
