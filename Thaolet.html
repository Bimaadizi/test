<p>Thaolet was an oil made by dwarves and used for protecting metals from moisture. It was also used to remove rust and tarnish from metal surfaces and blood from weapons.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thaolet was made by boiling certain plants and then mixing the result with the dust of particular types of stone. This created a black grimy oil that had preservative properties against moisture and oxidation. It was typically used to cleanse and preserve armor. Often a small barrel of thaolet was kept open near a workbench, anvil , or somewhere on a work site to submerge all but the handles of tools when not in use.</p>
<p>Thaolet was actually edible, but by all accounts it tasted terrible.</p>
