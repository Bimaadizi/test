<h2>History</h2>
<p>On 11 th of Flamerule , the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Athol of Candlekeep responded to Danilo Thann 's of Waterdeep numerous very persistent requests regarding the Of Blades and Blooded Honor . Athol turned down the Harper as the tome he had his eye on was ancient and one of the five oldest books stored in the library fortress of Candlekeep. Instead, Athol sent Danilo a sampling pages copied from the book, and if the Waterdhavian was satisfied with the contents, Athol offered to hire a scribe to make a complete copy foe a humble price of 5,000 gp . A generous offer, considering the scribe's youth and lack of experience.</p>
