<p>Vhailor was a Mercykiller fighter whose determination to deliver justice to his betrayer allowed his soul to escape death.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After untold years of magical imprisonment, all that remained of Vhailor was his armor and great axe, all covered in dents and rust. The red, piercing eyes glowing bright red from within his helmet were the only indicator that the armor actually held a soul within it.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Vhailor was the embodiment of Mercykiller ideals and values. He was zealous, relentless, and merciless and would go to any length to deliver a sentence for wrongdoings committed in all the planes , which was his life's calling. His belief in the power of Justice (which he viewed as a tangible source of power) was so strong that it allowed his soul to go past the weakness of his body and merge with the armor of his faction.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime while performing his Mercykiller duties, he was chasing a criminal across the planes, who turned out to be the Practical Incarnation of the Nameless One . Vhailor managed to corner him in an underground prison beneath the city of Curst , where his target appeared to surrender. This was a trap however, as he ended up being magically imprisoned within one of the dungeon's cells. But the zeal for justice and determination to complete his mission within Vhailor was so strong that, despite even his body rotting and withering away within his armor, his soul remained, awaiting to be awakened and continue his mission.</p>
<p>In a surprising turn of events, a later incarnation of the Nameless One was the one who reawakened and freed Vhailor. On top of this, the Nameless One actually managed to convince him to join him in his quest to regain his mortality . Sometime before 1369 DR while assisting him, Vhailor was ultimately defeated. Following this, Vhailor's helm ended up in the stock of an Athkatlan merchant named Deidre via unknown means.</p>
