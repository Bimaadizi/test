<p>Cabrath Nelinderra ( pronounced : / k ɑː ˈ b r ɑː θ n ɛ l ɪ n ˈ d ɛər ə / ka-BRATH nel-in-DAIR-uh ) was a female drow keening spirit and a cleric of Kiaransalee . She was considered Irae T'sarran 's top lieutenant in life.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In life, Cabrath was a dusky grey-skinned drow woman with amber eyes and gray-white hair. She tended to wear a heavy black robe with rich purple colors inside the sleeves.</p>
<p>After her death and transformation into a keening spirit , Cabrath was shrouded in a bone-white shimmer and appeared as an insubstantial and slightly transparent version of herself, with her robes trailing off into smoky nothingness.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A fearless devotee of Kiaransalee , Cabrath was well aware she would be transformed in the event of her death. She kept few physical objects, taking no pleasure in such luxuries. However, upon her transformation into a keening spirit, she seemed to become greatly distraught, wailing and sobbing continuously.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Cabrath was an adept leader and was considered capable enough to serve as Irae T'sarran's second-in-command of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra .</p>
<p>As a powerful cleric of Kiaransalee , Cabrath had a vast array of divine spells under command; however, she had an especially keen talent for necromancy spells. She often made sure to have herself and her weapons empowered with spells like bull's strength and magic weapon , which made her a formidable melee combatant. In combat, she could bring to bear her most powerful offensive spells, such as fire storm or destruction .</p>
<p>After Cabrath's transformation into a keening spirit , she still retained her potent spellcasting abilities but could release a deadly and terrifying wail akin to that of a banshee , as well as being capable of phasing through stone and flesh unhindered. Her touch, just like that of many other undead, inflicted a terrible chill, which could be exerted with maximum effect by phasing through her victim. She was impervious to most physical attacks.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to the voluminous black and purples robes he wore, Cabrath carried a bone-handled spectral dagger that had a glowing blue insubstantial blade. Beneath her robes, she wore a set of half-plate armor +4 which was further warded with a light fortification enchantment. Furthermore, she kept a fire elemental gem and a ring of protection +2 on her person.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The lover of the vampire monk and assassin Maas , Cabrath was often found in his company after the fall of Maerimydra in Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . They shared a suite in Castle Maerimydra , where Maas occasionally enjoyed watching her eat.</p>
<p>Cabrath was considered by Irae T'sarran to be one of her most trusted lieutenants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR, Cabrath was the second-in-command of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra . She worked with Irae T'sarran to overthrow House Chûmavh after the invasion of Kurgoth Hellspawn during Lolth's Silence . Once the Kiaransaleean cult had established control of Castle Maermimydra , Cabrath became responsible for the newly converted lesser Temple of Kiaransalee at the top level of the castle, which served as a companion to the Undying Temple .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , Cabrath had taken up residence in the Acropolis of Thanatos in V'elddrinnsshar , where she was the head priestess of the Crones . While she tried opening a gate to the Negative Energy plane in order to bring forth an army of undead, she was killed again by the Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann , right after she grievously injured Halisstra Melarn by phasing through her.</p>
<p>Shortly after her destruction, she was bound to rejuvenate with time, but the massive amount of voidstone and the negative energy it exerted accelerated the process. However, since she was a keening spirit by Kiaransalee's will, when Q'arlynd Melarn and his apprentices exerted Elven high magic to erase Kiaransalee's name from her worshipers, the goddess disappeared, and so did Cabrath.</p>
