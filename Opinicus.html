<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Opinicus appeared to be a blend of several animals. They possessed the body of a camel with the face of a monkey . They also had a lion 's mane and tail with eagle wings sprouting from their back. Their front paws had opposable thumbs, allowing them to grasp things like monkeys.</p>
<p>Most opinicus were light brown or golden in color, with darker faces and wings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
