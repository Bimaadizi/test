<p>The Destroyer of the Hills was a unique girdle of bluntness that earned its name from the exploits of its original owner.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer of the girdle was given significant protection from attacks that sought to bludgeon or crush an individual.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was first worn by Garrar the Powerful , a man whose homeland was overrun by hill giants . With the girdle's magic protection, he drove the foul giants from his home, off to neighboring lands that were not as fortunate—thus the Destroyer of the Hills earned its name.</p>
<p>At some time during or before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the girdle came into the possession of a bandit named Caldo .</p>
<p>Another copy of the item belonged to a priest of Moradin who served the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn in Icewind Dale in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR .</p>
