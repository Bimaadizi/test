<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jennylou's notable contributions to the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter included interviews and reporting on certain strange events in the Living City. In the Alturiak issue of Trumpeter , the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Jennylou Brightleaf reported on eyewitness events from the streets of Ravens Bluff that involved Lord Lorien Keltree Darkarrow and a group of people in the city's wharves. The Lord's skin was turned red, and a tail of a horse wagged attached to his noble behind. One of his companions, Joydancer Tellasi of Lliira , was seen yelling at a grieving mother to get over the death of her child. In the aftermath, Jennylou Brightleaf reached out to those involved for commentaries. Lord Dararrow simply claimed the group had a very bad day, and the Joydancer was in seclusion and unreachable. Jennylou also reported that this strange occurrence could've been an effect of a gypsy curse of some description.</p>
<p>In Uktar , Nightal of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Jennylou Brightleaf interviewed an eccentric hin member of the Knights of the Golden Rooster . Sir Pom Fritte Fromage recently announced the formation of the so-called Halfling Nation and, on short notice, Jennylou organized an interview at the hin's spacious suite at the Seven Tigers Inn . The knight stated that unlike elves and dwarves , halflings did not form cities, towns, and nations (strangely forgetting about the existence of Luiren ). However, Pom Fritte Fromage loved all the amenities the city of Ravens Bluff offered to him and wanted to keep the "nation" within the city walls. The halfling ended the interview, declaring that all haltings interested in joining the "nation" were to stop at the Seven Tigers Inn and book a room using the special Halfling Nation rate.</p>
