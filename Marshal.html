<p>Marshal were honorable, martial leaders and tacticians from all walks of life. They were considered by many in the Realms to be an essential facet of an army.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Many marshals lived rather mercenary lives, hiring out for commission the strategic services of themselves and any forces they commanded. They could often be found traveling in the midst of armies or as part of adventuring companies . Most felt honor bound to fulfill any commission they undertook, but would not sacrifice the lives of the people they commanded â€“ in such circumstances, they would rather choose to end their contract and find a new patron for their compatriots elsewhere.</p>
<p>The types of commissions that a marshal took on were generally reflective of their alignment . Good -aligned were often crusading types, seeking out evil to eradicate, whilst evil -aligned marshals tended to accept commissions that put them in invading and plundering forces. Those of a Lawful bent tended to accept commissions that involved the repelling of such foreign aggressors, while those of a chaotic bent were often found in proper mercenary companies.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>All marshals in the Realms had significant military experience, with some being also fighters or paladins . Some marshals underwent some form of formal training and study to acquire their marked skills in leadership and battle strategy, usually in the army of a noble or within a military academy or war college. There existed several such colleges across the Realms, such as the Academy of Arms in Athkatla . Others started their lives as mere grunts footsoldiers, working their way up the ranks of an army and acquiring experience over time. The decision to undertake this profession sometimes grew from a want to follow in the footsteps of a parent that had served as an officer in an army or mercenary company.</p>
<p>In Cormyr , marshals could be found amongst the ranks of the Purple Dragon knights , where they often had to learn how to coordinate magical strategies alongside conventional military strategies as they worked alongside Cormyr's War Wizards .</p>
<p>Marshals viewed themselves and other marshals as being part of a select class in society, to the point that even a marshal on the opposing side was afforded some respect.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While all marshals had basic training in fighting and general knowledge of various forms of armor and weaponry, though lacked any proficiency with tower shields , making them passable warriors , their real strength lied in their ability to command and inspire trust in others. They also tended to be very geographically oriented, having great mental maps of the battlefields or dungeon warrens they treaded. Marshals that had acquired significant experience in their lifetime of commanding others were found to exude a commanding aura through their confidence, making those who fought under them do markedly better within conflicts. In some cases, this commanding aura was even found to improve spellcasting abilities.</p>
