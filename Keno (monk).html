<h2>History</h2>
<p>Keno died many moons before the late 14 th century DR. His undeath was spent guarding the Crypt of Durkon of Shou Lung . In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Keno and his fellow ghostly sentries faced an illithid incursion led by Goxxa the alhoon . The mind flayers consumed ancient preserved minds of the crypt's dead and sought the Claw of the Black Leopard . At the same time, a vampire thief named Hexxat arrived at the tomb on the behest of her master Larloch , who sought the tomb's magical treasure—the Claw of the Black Leopard . Unlike many other guardians, Keno offered the vampire and her companions' passage if they were to aid the inhabitants of the Kara-Turan tomb to fend off the aberrant intruders.</p>
