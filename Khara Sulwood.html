<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lady Sulwood had auburn hair that reached shoulder length.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Khara was the great-granddaughter of Doust Sulwood , a former lord of Shadowdale.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Khara Sulwood grew up in Arabel hearing tales of her great-grandfather's ruling days, and decided that when she came of age she would return to the Dalelands and pick up his mantle once again.</p>
<p>Khara Sulwood was proclaimed Lady of Shadowdale at dusk on Marpenoth 12 in the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , after the death of Addee Ulphor .</p>
<p>Under her leadership, Khara facilitated the arrival of numerous fey beings into the dale and its surrounding forests, prompting a shift in local woodcutting practices towards a cooperative approach of forest management. This change led to an expansion in berry and mushroom farming. Additionally, she granted the Harpers permission to utilize Storm Silverhand 's farmhouse for purposes such as training, retirement, and healing. Furthermore, Khara worked to restore amicable relations with Cormyr , appointing Daethia Rowanmantle , granddaughter of Kortyl Rowanmantle , as the permanent envoy.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Star Walker's Return, 1490 DR , Khara noticed a decline in her mental faculties, prompting her to initiate the training of successors. In Nightal of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , she resigned from her position as lord and entrusted the Twisted Tower and rule of Shadowdale to Mareldraea Hawkguard .</p>
<p>Khara then retired to Storm's farmhouse, where she intended to spend her remaining days enjoying domestic tasks and reading from a varied library.</p>
