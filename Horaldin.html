<p>Horaldin was a druid in the Promenade of the Dark Maiden .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , Qilué Veladorn asked his help in investigating a gem found in the possession of a Selvetargtlin aranea and thanks to his power he was able to explain some of the history of the gem.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Lost Keep, 1379 DR , Qilué ordered to Horaldin to place a glyph of insanity inside the Promenade that would attract the followers of Ghaunadaur ; he was worried about it and argued with Qilué.</p>
<p>Later Horaldin explained the matter to the Darksong Knight Cavatina Xarann .</p>
<p>Horaldin was killed by Qilué under compulsion from Wendonai . Having used the Crescent Blade , Horaldin's soul was destroyed and he could not be resurrected. (However, it is not for sure, as souls of Qilué and Cavatina weren't destroyed when they were killed by Crescent Blade.)</p>
