<p>Kostil was an elder malaugrym in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR, regarding the hunt for Elminster Aumar , Kostil joked to the younger malaugrym, provoking them to attack the human wizard without preparation. The young Taernil accepted Kostil's challenge.</p>
<p>Kostil later suggested they kidnap Elminster, instead of killing him, and take him to the Castle of Shadows . However, Dlagim reminded Kostil that last time El had gone to the Castle of Shadows he slew forty malaugrym and only Dlagim and two others survived.</p>
