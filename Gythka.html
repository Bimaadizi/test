<p>A gythka was a type of exotic weapon invented by the thri-kreen and unique to them.</p>
<p>It was a long, two-handed polearm with a crescent-shaped blade mounted on each end. These dealt deep slashing wounds. A highly trained warrior could fight with both ends at once. It could also be hurled as a spear. It was much more familiar to the thri-kreen, who, with four arms, could wield two gythkas simultaneously.</p>
<p>Collectors would buy these weapons if they were in good condition.</p>
