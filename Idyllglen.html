<p>Idyllglen was a settlement in Faerûn that was the target of multiple gnoll attacks. Their final assault upon the city was pivotal in the events that led to the fall of Zariel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the city's distant past, it was constantly threatened by neighboring gnoll tribes. The town's cleric Solndor Brightstar led the population in prayer to Lathander for help. The deity, moved by the townsfolk's bravery, sent the then- solar Zariel to their aid. With the angel's help, the gnolls were driven away.</p>
<p>Some time later, the gnolls attacked again, personally led by Yeenoghu and aided by demons . Zariel led the Hellriders to fight the demons, banishing Yeenoghu. She later led her loyal servants into Avernus to continue the battle. However, a group of Hellriders led by Jander Sunstar panicked and deserted the band, sealing the portal back behind them and stranding the remaining members in Avernus.</p>
