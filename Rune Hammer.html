<h2>History</h2>
<p>The artifact known as the Rune Hammer was a product of the dwarvish Broodhull Clan that ruled over the mountains of the Vilhon Reach region in Central Faerûn for centuries until its mysterious disappearance. Within a single year, all two hundred members of Clan Broodhull were gone, leaving behind only empty halls. One artifact that the Broodhull Clan left behind was a glittering, rune-carved, mighty war hammer.</p>
<p>More common versions of the Rune Hammer with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
