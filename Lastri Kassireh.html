<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Captain Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the Chultan nation of Samarach . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled, freshwater barrels – ruptured, one of the crew – Kellen got drunk and drowned, Volo almost got poisoned, new ropes became frayed.</p>
<p>Close to the shores of Samarach, the ship's ill luck culminated in a storm that destroyed the Vigilant , tossing the broken vessel to the shores. Several members of Lastri's crew died in the shipwreck; however, the captain herself, along with the first mate Kadjin , were captured by a gang of hungry Batiri goblins .</p>
<p>With her livelihood gone and reputation tarnished, Lastri Kassireh abandoned her career as a captain and dedicated herself to finding what turned out to be a saboteur from the Cult of Zehir . She joined her fellow survivors, now Sa'Sani's hirelings in untangling the yuan-ti plot. During their adventures, Lastri angered her goddess and realized that her future laid in being a sellsword, and not venturing into the Bath Queen's domain.</p>
