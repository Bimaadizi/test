<p>Rain linnorms were a species of linnorm , a group of very rare, primitive but powerful dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rain linnorms were massive, serpentine creatures that ranged from 1‒4 ft (0.3‒1.2 m) long plus a 1‒8 ft (0.3‒2.4 m)-long tail at hatching, to 109‒130 ft (33.2‒40 m) plus a 116‒118 ft (35.4‒36 m)-long tail as great wyrms. They had teardrop-shaped scales which were shiny white on hatchlings, and which grew thicker and harder as they aged and which, on adults, could change colors between white, grey, blue, or green at the linnorm's will.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like other linnorms, rain linnorms were cruel and destructive. They were also incredibly vain: they took-nay, demanded- credit for the heinous actions they committed. They were also greedy for treasure.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like all types of dragons, rain linnorms possessed potent magical abilities as well as a nasty breath weapon: a stream of boiling water some 3 feet (0.91 meters) wide and 90 feet (27 meters) long. They were inherently immune to damage caused by electricity; old rain linnorms were additionally invulnerable to missile weapons, while very old individuals were also immune to nonmagical blunt weapons, and those old enough to be called venerable were immune to nonmagical edged weapons. The rare wyrms inherently regenerated. They also gained the following inherent spell-like abilities as they aged:</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Immature rain linnorms were impetuous and quick to attack at the chance of treasure. They typically started with their breath weapon and magical abilities, but would claw and bite an victims they perceived as nonthreatening, so as to avoid damaging potential treasure.</p>
<p>Mature rain linnorms, however, disdained physical combat and relied solely on their far more potent magical abilities before resorting to their breath weapon.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Rain linnorms made their lairs deep within hills, hiding their treasure within the dark burrows. But they rested within only when the weather was pleasant, preferring to sleep in open and be buffeted by wind and rain. Rain linnorms attempted to kill any intelligent creature that approached their lair. And if one suspected that the location of it's lair was known, it would find a new lair elsewhere and move every single piece of treasure.</p>
<p>Rain linnorms were a species of incredibly solitary individuals, believing as they did that all other creatures, up to and including other rain linnorms, were beneath them. The only exception was during breeding season, when mated pairs watched over their nests. These pairs left each other and the nest as soon as the eggs hatched.</p>
<p>It was said that while rain linnorms could eat anything, their favorite food was lightning bolts. They had no natural predators except for foolish adventurers.</p>
