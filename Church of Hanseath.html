<p>The church of Hanseath was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of the dwarf god Hanseath , the Bearded One.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Hanseath often ordered his followers to wage war against traditional dwarvish foes, such as drow , giants , goblinoids , or orcs .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hanseath's followers were always seemingly off on some kind of crusade, often either in battle or marching towards the next one, and his clerics often served in dwarven military units (as both healers and spellcasters) urging their fellows into battle.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Hanseath was a deity held in esteem by barbarians and brewers alike, being highly regarded by dwarves that charged into battle ignoring the odds and a representative of the festive side of dwarfkind.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>During the glory days of Myth Drannor , the dwarves who maintained the Shrine of Hanseath held the title of "brewmaster".</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>Prayers to Hanseath were, in short, drinking songs; they were often chanted or sung, and many had simple rhyming schemes and frequent, repetitive choruses. His rituals were abundant with food and drink, often appearing to be great feasts, and most were raucous events performed before battle or after victory. The sole exception to this was the Ritual of the Cleft Shield, a rite notable in dwarven culture for being particularly, heartbreakingly solemn. It was performed by followers of Hanseath for a particularly beloved comrade that fell in battle.</p>
<h2>Bases</h2>
<h3>Shrines & Temples</h3>
<p>Hanseath's shrines were great festhalls , most of which had extensive kitchens and pantries attached, dominated by long tables for worshipers to feast at and raise their goblets to the glory of the Bearded One.</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>Brewmasters produced sacred beers and ales that possessed different beneficial magical properties.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Given their rebellious streak, Hanseath's clerics were not always comfortable for the rest of a dwarf army to mix with, and many times were segregated into their own berserker units.</p>
