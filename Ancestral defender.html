<p>An ancestral defender was a ghostly manifestation of a noble Ffolk warrior that could be summoned into battle by the upper echelons of the Callidyrr dragoons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ancestral defenders appeared when the Ffolk spirits that empowered a dragoon were stirred into action.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The spirit could not attack the dragoon's foes except by redirecting their attacks back at them. A defender's primary role in battle was to assist or heal a dragoon and their allies, however it could not act independently: the dragoon had to direct and choose its actions, and even the spirit's ability to exist on the battlefield was tied to the dragoon's own vitality.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The spirit could be summoned using a primal rite known as a dragoon summons . A Callidyrr dragoon focused their willpower and howled an ancient, traditional Ffolk battle cry to summon the spirit, which appeared within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of the dragoon and was heralded by a chill wind. An ancestral defender lingered until it was destroyed or until the summoner dismissed it.</p>
