<p>The Jagged Rocks was a temple dedicated to Umberlee located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far western corner of the Foreign Quarter along Teshwave Street and Mace Way .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The exterior of the temple was shaped by craftsmen to resemble a rocky outcropping similar to what would be found along a shore. A shining light, symbolizing a lighthouse, sat at the apex.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Services were held daily at high tide. Special occasions took place during savage storms. Since Zhentil Keep was spending a good amount of coin and time rebuilding its navy after the city's destruction in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the temple saw a steady influx of recent converts eager to appease the Bitch Queen.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The High Priestess of the temple in 1369 DR was Stormmistress . She was assisted by six priestesses.</p>
