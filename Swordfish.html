<p>Swordish were a peaceful species of predatory fish , named for their flat pointed bills that resembled swords .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Being non-aggressive creatures, swordfish typically fled from conflict unless provoked or trained to engage in combat. When they did fight, a swordfish would use their long sword-like bills.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Medium-sized swordfish were often kept as pets or utilized as guards by other creatures, typically aquatic elfs and dolphin communities. Swordfish flesh was a delicacy but the species was hard to fish for as swordfish had a habit of ripping through fishing nets . Instead, sailors fished for them with hooks, one swordfish at a time. Swordfish was also found served in eateries, namely the Emerald Lantern , where it was served with a side of vegetables. The Lambent Eye of Ravens Bluff served swordfish encrusted in nuts, while Nimber's Skewer Shop offered grilled swordfish and mango skewers .</p>
<p>Swordfish were also an occasional prey of spiretop dragons . It took a small flock to kill a single swordfish.</p>
<p>Swordfish inhabited the Sea of Swords ,the Bay of Dancing Dolphins , and the Dragon Reach in Faer√ªn , and in the Golden Gulf , off the coast of Sikak and Maribar Island .</p>
