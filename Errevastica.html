Xvartette was 10 ft (3 m) tall with purple skin, and exceptionally beautiful by xvart standards. When she used disguise self to appear as a human , Errevastica appeared as a beautiful woman with characteristic iron teeth.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As an annis hag, Errevastica had the ability to cast the spell disguise self . She could also summon banderhobbs .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Errevastica was wealthy. She had been given much treasure by the xvarts that served her, which she kept behind her throne under a pile of refuse. She owned a spindle made from gold , a potion of resistance , a potion of fire breath , a spell scroll of cure wounds , and a spellbook that she had confiscated from her captive Bernadette .</p>
<p>Her prized posession was her evil comb , a very large comb that could be swung as a magic weapon or used to transform a victim's hair into an evil fey creature.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Errevastica spent much of her time on her throne, using the evil comb to comb Bezoar's hair and receiving gifts from her adoring xvarts. She used the magical properties of Bezoar's hair to clone xvarts and sent them to do evil in Silverymoon. She wished to eat the people of Silverymoon, especially the children.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Errevastica kept many prisoners. She kept the korred Bezoar in a magical iron cage , and had magical control over his long hair which served her. She was aware of Bezoar's hair's special property to duplicate objects and clone creatures. Bezoar hated Errevastica. She had also imprisoned the barber Jooge Nopsmoth, as well as Two Llamas Running , a tabaxi who she inteded to dismember and turn into hair product. She also kept Bernadette captured.</p>
<p>She was also served by two clones of Jooge that she had created; one one evil and one good . The evil Jooge plotted against her. Errevastica had created a redcap to be his assistant. The redcap served both the evil Jooge and Errevastica. The good Jooge was given an evil magic tooth, which Errevastica could use to listen to everything that he heard.</p>
<p>Errevastica's most faithful servants were a growing number of xvarts, numbering more than 50. They were in love with her Xvartette persona, not knowing of her true identity. The former leader of the xvarts, a warlock of raxivort , loathed Errevastica for ending Raxivort-worship. He was too afraid to act against her.</p>
<p>The boggle Wallace served Errevastica, and she had him distract Mops Nopsmoth from anything strange about her father's barbershop. Wallace was afraid of Errevastica, and wanted to help Mops escape from her.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Errevastica had spent a long time pursuing Bezoar. She had also had taken control of a group of xvarts by posing as Xvartette. Bezoar became a frequent client of the barber Jooge Nopsmoth in Silverymoon . Jooge borrowed 10,000 gp from a group of darklings to purchase a flail snail to use for hair dye . The darklings were unable to collect their debt from Jooge, so Errevastica used disguise self to in her human disguise, and bought the debt from them. She used this influence over Jooge to capture both him and Bezoar.</p>
<p>She used the evil comb to manipulate Bezoar's hair. She used the special properties of his hair to create many more xcarts, as well as two clones of Jooge; one evil and one good . She imprisoned the original Jooge below the barbershop that he once owned, as his clones and her xvarts took control.</p>
