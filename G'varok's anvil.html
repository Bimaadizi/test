<p>G'varok's anvil was once a profitable and secretly enchanted anvil that belonged to a renowned dwarvish smith named G'varok of Mirabar some years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As the 1374Â DR , G'varok's anvil was a large anvil, cracked in two, with its surface looking blackened and brittle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When it was used by G'varok, the anvil was enchanted to dramatically improve the dwarf's blacksmithing work.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>G'varok of Mirabar became renowned for his great work forging weapons and armor of the highest quality, years before 1374 DR. Unbeknownst to everyone but the dwarf, he commissioned the enchanting of his anvil by a master wizard , ensuring that every piece crated on it was a marvelous masterpiece. With time, G'varok fame spread across the Sword Coast and the dwarf pridefully declared himself the greatest smith alive. The fame eventually was G'varok's downfall. A powerful frost giant and a master smith named Marruti from all the way in the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale headed off the dwarf's claims. The giant traveled to Mirabar and challenged G'varok to a smithing contest. Historical accounts did not preserve the competition's details but its outcome was well known. Marruti was the first to take a hammer to G'varok's anvil and with a single strike cracked it in the middle. With the anvil becoming unusable, G'varok lost the competition, unable to magically boost his smithing skills. The dwarf left Mirabar in disgrace and G'varok's anvil , reportedly, was taken by Marruti as a trophy.</p>
<p>By 1374 DR, G'varok's anvil had found its way into the hands of planeswalking wizard and curio dealer Mintassan the Magnificent and was proudly displayed among many other unique and strange items in his shop, Mintassan's Mysteries .</p>
