<p>Valeanne was a female eladrin residing in Karador , the capital of Sarifal , on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles as of the mid-to-late 15 th century DR . She was a key participant in a plot to save the le Shay princess Amaranth from the wrath of the girl's half-sister, High Lady Ordalf , and died while helping the princess escape from Sarifal.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She gave her life to keep her promises and to save the life of the young Amaranth, although she was not be happy about it. She believed that doing the right thing was not the same as doing a good thing. She could be manipulative and merciless.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Valeanne was of high enough station to be referred to as "madam" within Sarifal's court. She had a caretaking role over the young Amaranth, who referred to her as mistress.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Valeanne made a promise to safeguard the youngest daughter of Princess Callia of the le Shay, Amaranth, from the wrath and jealousy of her elder daughter, Ordalf. Soon after, Callia and Amaranth's father were both killed by Prince Araithe , Ordalf's son.</p>
<p>Soon after, in the late 1460s DR, Ordalf gave birth to a sickly son that lived only a few days. Realizing that it was time to remove Amaranth from Ordalf's grasp for her protection. Valeanne conspired with Tiana and Shamasar to kidnap Princess Amaranth from Karador and transport her to the court of Queen Erliza Daressin on Snowdown . The plan was to awaken the nine-year-old before dawn on the day that the dying baby was to be anointed, flee the city before first light, get fresh horses at Glenraugh , and then ride up to Crane Point , where a pair of hippogriff riders would pick them up and fly them to Snowdown. They told the girl (who remained oblivious to the threat to her life) that they were planning to meet her sister on the shores of lake Ulls , and would enjoy some mulled wine as they watched the griffons at Corwell's Steeple . Valeanne and Shamasar, accompanied by five of Shamasar's dragonborn soldiers, departed from Karador while Tiana had already gone ahead to Snowdown.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their plan was betrayed, and a host of drow , cyclopes , and driders ambushed them as they neared Crane Point, killing Shamasar and his troops, incinerating one of the hippogriffs, and badly wounding the remaining rider. Tired from the journey, the petulant Amaranth proved uncooperative as Valeanne tried to navigate the battlefield, forcing her to lie to and manhandle the girl as well as to execute her beloved pony , Flower , right in front of her. She managed to hand off the girl to the surviving hippogriff, who flew away as she tried to say goodbye. She then waited to be set upon by the drow,</p>
<p>The hippogriff rider would subsequently succumb to his wounds after veering off in the wrong direction, dropping Amaranth onto Moray and causing her to be lost to the le Shay for a decade. Meanwhile, Valeanne was remembered in death as a traitor to Sarifal.</p>
