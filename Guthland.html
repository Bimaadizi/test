<p>The Guthland was the land along the eastern shoreline of the Thingulph on the Chultan Peninsula of southwest Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Guthland covered much of eastern Thindol. The River Guth formed the Guthland's northern boundary.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The term "Guthland" dated back to an era between -1732 DR and -189 DR when a strong population of lizardfolk forced the humans of the Thinguth tribe to evacuate their easternmost holdings.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Though they spread throughout Thindol and Samarach , the Guthland was still the ancestral home of the Thinguth tribe. Hamlets and villages dotted the entire range of the Guthland. Delselar was by far the largest city. The eastern borders of the Guthland near the Hazur and Guth Mountains were heavily fortified with watchtowers.</p>
