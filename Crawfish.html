Archendale was also known for its abundant crawfish. Smaller species of crayfish inhabited the waters of Lake Sember in Cormanthyr and in the Lake Tirulag of Rashemen . The reservoirs of the meadow called Halendos in Aglarond were home to crayfish.</p>
<p>A species of crawfish was known to inhabited bodies of water in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Usages</h2>
<p>The Painted Boat Restaurant in Ravens Bluff sold cooked river crayfish for a mere five silver pieces .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in Cormyr 's past, people of Nesmyth brought popper crayfish over from from the Wyvernwater to the Starwater River . This changed the river's biome. The most fish in the lower Starwater was consumed by the crayfish and the abundance of these frustrations attracted electric eels that fed on them.</p>
