<p>Nightshades were large undead creatures from the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nightshades were all different in form, but they were often said to appear to be made of darkness. They were also said to smell like open graves.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nightshades were composed as much of evil as of darkness.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Nightshades varied greatly in abilities, but all of them radiated a 20‑foot (6.1‑meter) aura of desecration so powerful as to be akin in strength to a shrine of an evil power; only dispel evil or a similar effect could get rid of it, although a consecrated or hallowed area would suppress the aura, but at the cost of being suppressed in turn.</p>
<p>Nightshades were averse to natural sunlight, which weakened them upon contact. They understood all languages but communicated only by telepathy .</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>There were at least four known types of nightshades:</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Some nightshades were known to act as servants of the deities Urdlen and Shar .</p>
