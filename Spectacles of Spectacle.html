<p>The Spectacles of Spectacle were a pair of magical spectacles crafted by the wizard Perriavor . They allowed their wearer to see and interact with beings from other planes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Spectacles of Spectacle resembled a normal pair of spectacles, but were colored green and looked unusually ornate.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Wearing the Spectacles allowed a person to see beings from a wide variety of other planes. These beings could then be pulled into the Prime Material Plane and interacted with. Additionally, the Spectacles made their wearer more resistant to—and aware of— illusion magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Spectacles were crafted by Perriavor, a gnome wizard with a tendency towards wanderlust. Perriavor's intention was to use the Spectacles to interview extraplanar beings so he could find safe locations to cross over into their planes. Unfortunately for Perriavor, he disappeared after being tricked by a devil into performing an unsafe shift to Phlegethos , leaving only the Spectacles behind.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , the Spectacles were in the hands of Zaviak , a human wizard who acquired them from a "giant gnome" in Sigil . Zaviak used the magical spectacles to go on a "vision quest," but ended up confused and "freaked out" in Baldur's Gate 's Elfsong Tavern (he himself believed he was in a tavern in the sewers of Waterdeep ).</p>
