<p>Violins were a type of small stringed musical instrument. They were also called fiddles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Violins were approximately 2 feet (0.61 meters) in length and had four, occasionally five, strings. These strings created mellow musical tones when they were stroked with a bow. Playing the instrument involved tucking it under one's chin, near the collarbone, holding it with one hand while they worked the bow with the other. Some of the violins found in the Western Heartlands were made out of cedar and burled walnut wood.</p>
