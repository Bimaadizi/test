<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the month of Kythorn in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Variance Amatick received a vision from Shar, commanding her to retrieve The Leaves of One Night for the Shadovar . Meanwhile, in the city of Yhaunn in Sembia , a series of artifacts were discovered in a deep tunnel under that city's quarries. These were delivered to the wizard and archeologist Strasus Thingoleir , who believed them to be of Netherese origin. Among the treasures was a pair of slate tiles that were The Leaves of One Night .</p>
<p>On the 20 th of Eleasias of the same year, the Shadovar were able to recover the work. Variance Amatick had successfully tricked and manipulated Keph Thingoleir , Strasus's son, by threatening to kill his friend if he did not steal The Leaves from his father's study. This he did, while a Sharran cult led by Variance attacked the temple of Selûne in the city, drawing Strasus and the rest of his wizard family to its aid.</p>
<p>While Keph tried to return the tiles to Variance, the shadow mastiff that she sent to retrieve them from him charged at him, and the magic of the tiles allowed him to somehow banish the summoned monster, but the magic left one of the silver letters inscribed on his thumb from where it had touched one of the tiles. The letter had transferred itself onto his skin and was forevermore missing from the text of The Leaves . From that day onward, he had the power to banish creatures of shadow.</p>
<p>Keph reached Variance as she was battling with Feena Archwood , a werewolf priestess of Selûne. Variance abandoned the fight but was able to swipe the slate tiles from Keph's hands, vanishing into the shadows.</p>
<p>Variance returned to Rivalen Tanthul and showed him The Leaves of One Night , but neither of them could interpret either the silver letters or its magical, dark whisperings.</p>
<p>On Uktar 29 of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , during the Sembian Civil War , Variance led a contingent of Sharran priests to help in the Battle of Selgaunt on the orders of Prince Rivalen Tanthul . On Uktar 30 during the battle Rivalen ordered Variance and her clerics to destroy seven summoned earth elementals marching upon the city and protect Thamalon Uskevren II .</p>
<p>By Nightal 8 , Variance was leader of the temple to Shar in Selgaunt .</p>
