<h2>Reputation</h2>

<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>The sword was carried by the priestess Velsinore in 1373 DR . She wore it somewhat awkwardly, but did so only because fellow priest Mifano wore the Waxing Crescent openly and they were competing for influence under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar .</p>
