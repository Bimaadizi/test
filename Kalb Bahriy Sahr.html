<p>Kalb Bahriy Sahr , or the Shark Reef , was a island chain formed from coral reefs. This reef was located in the Djinni's Claws in the Crowded Sea southwest of mainland Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>These small islands were composed of coral and rock. No known charts existed for safely navigating them, making most sailors give them a wide berth.</p>
<p>Dangerous waves and powerful storms surrounding the reef regularly dashed ships against the islands if they got too close.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As the name implied, the waters surrounding these islands were teeming with sharks of all sizes represented by many different species.</p>
