<p>Darromar , formerly known as Ithmong , was a metropolis and the capital of Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay on the River Ith . Its central location ensured that the queen's armies in 1479 DR were never more than five days' hard ride from any trouble in her domain.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city included a scenic river walk paved with red bricks and decorated with lilac and honeysuckle and flanked with willow trees.</p>
<h2>Layout</h2>
<p>The city was divided into quarters by the River Ith (east–west) and the Ithal Road (north–south), with the Ithal Bridge in the center. Clockwise from the northwest quarter to the southwest quarter were:</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was formerly ruled by a council, but Queen Zaranda felt that it was necessary to have one person in charge at the top. This position was held by the Lord-Mayor Ternan Grannox in 1370 DR . It was a position that was appointed or elected once every three years. In truth, however, Ternan's Consort Brenna Grannox dictated her husband's every move, manipulating him with lies that resulted in some improper treatment of her social and/or political foes.</p>
<h2>Military</h2>
<p>The city watch had around 200 members, but the army of Tethyr, a further 5,000, was garrisoned in this city when not on duty or assigned elsewhere.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The settlement began as a Calishite frontier garrison town named Calimaronn until it was sacked in the Battle for Calimaronn by Tethyrian tribes led by Chieftain Mong Ithal of Clan Ithal . The town was named Ithmong from thenceforth.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Falling Moon, 1217 DR , the stonecutters' guild of Ithmong carved a life-size statue in honor of Jondar the Valiant , a hero paladin of Helm , who slew a medusa in the Starspire Mountains . Or so the story went. Her statue was placed on a large fountain at Ithmong's center, atop a cube pedestal carved with medusae heads. With generations passing, details of the statue's creation became obfuscated, and her deeds in dealing with medusae forgotten. The statue of Jondar the Valiant remained atop the fountain, growing moss and collecting pigeon dung . However, to everyone's shock, the mage named Mibbet the Meddler , in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , decided to cast the stone to flesh spell on the paladin's carving. His hunch turned out to be true as Jondar herself stepped down from the pedestal, thanked Mibbet, and walked into the sunset.</p>
