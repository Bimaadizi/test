<p>Asdezel was a sage from Aglarond around 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Asdezel spent time on the isle of Paldir within the Pirate Isles researching the mysterious gigantic relief carvings in the cliff face of the mountains. The fact that the carvings had no visible hand or footholds led him to believe they were created by a race of flying creatures. However, the carvings themselves did not depict flying creatures.</p>
