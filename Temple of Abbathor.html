<p>The temple of Abbathor was a temple structure built into the rocky formation within the Sword Mountains , dedicated to Abbathor , dwarven deity of greed.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was situated in a cleft within the mountains, east of Leilon , about 15 mi (24 km) southwest of Phandalin .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple structure was hewn out of solid stone, in the facade of the mountainside. Just outside its main entrance was a small settlement that was long-since abandoned.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
