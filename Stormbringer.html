<p>Stormbringer was an enchanted battleaxe dedicated to Talos , the Lord of Storms.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The axe was engraved with the words that read "Lord of Storms", a dedication to Talos. However, the engraving bore no magical significance and its +1 enchantment was achieved by some other means. Additionally, the axe dealt magical lightning damage upon successful strike and allowed the wielder to cast the lightning bolt ten times.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stormbringer was believed to have been crated sometime long before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , however its origins remained unknown. The axe was an arcane artifact caught after by pirate captains for its magics that controlled storms and thunder. In 1374 DR, Stormbringer found its way to the city of Westgate and was used by Captain Gothos One-Eye of the Dark Dahlia buccaneer vessel.</p>
