<p>An elixir of truth —also known as a truth potion or potion of truth —was a magical or mundane potion that would cause the drinker to tell the truth.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Magical versions of these brews possessed a faint enchantment dweomer to those who could see such things. They could sell for around 500 gold pieces in markets that sold magical items.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There were several versions and variations of truth-telling potions in the Realms. Some magical versions acted similar to a ring of truth causing the voice of the imbiber to rise to high frequencies if telling a lie. This effect would last for between one and four hours but could not detect magical means of deception. Other variations were limited in effects to shorter time periods, such as ten minutes, and could be resisted somewhat by those of strong will.</p>
<p>Nonmagical versions sent the drinker into a stupor and slowed them for 20 minutes to an hour, but could only force the drinker to answer one to four questions. Such mundane potions expired in potency after about a month and only worked on humans , demihumans , and humanoids . Individuals with a high tolerance against poisons could sometimes resist the effects of the brew.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Some magical versions required that the brewer be able to cast the zone of truth spell. Nonmagical versions required five days to brew.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Mystics in the Realms were known to create mundane potions such as truth potions. Master Harpers were able to craft magical versions.</p>
