<p>Abeils (sometimes pluralized as "abeil" ), also commonly known as bee people , were humanoid bee -like creatures that lived in large hive-cities. They were divided into three castes: the laboring vassals , the fighting soldiers (also known as stormwings ), and the ruling queens .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Abeils exhibited a mix of the features of bees and elves . Bristly fur colored in alternating bands of black and yellow covered their bodies. Their heads were elf-like, though their eyes were black and faceted, and they sported antennae. They had four-digited hands, translucent bee-like wings, and stingers.</p>
<p>Vassals and queens had relatively slender limbs, while those of the larger soldiers were much more muscular.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All abeils could emit a sleep-inducing droning sound by beating their wings. This sound had no effect on other abeils. Soldiers could even beat their wings vigorously enough to deal damage.</p>
<p>Every caste had its own kind of poison that could be injected through stinging their target. Vassals and soldiers could weaken anyone they stung for a period generally lasting from a few days up to two tendays , with the soldiers' poison being twice as effective, though the recovery period could be sped up through extensive rest and the use of spells such as restoration . The poison of a queen, though less effective in the short term, was permanent without the use of restorative spells.</p>
<p>Abeil queens could cast divine spells as if they were high-level druids .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abeils generally fought while airborne, eschewing any armor that might weigh them down, and attacked from a distance if possible. If forced into melee range, they tended to swarm powerful opponents to sting them with their debilitating poison.</p>
<p>Vassals rarely fought unless ordered to. Those armed for battle generally wielded light flails .</p>
<p>Soldiers were, as the name implies, the caste most often drawn into battle. They wielded bows and ranseurs .</p>
<p>Queens only fought if threatened directly. Rather than wielding weapons, they made use of their divine spells.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Abeils lived in hive-cities, with the majority of the population consisting of vassals, and about a third of soldiers. They were very expansionistic, splitting off and founding new hive-cities whenever they'd grown too populous.</p>
<p>Vassals performed the hive-city's labor at the behest of their queen, including tasks such as gathering pollen, producing goods, and maintaining the city's structures. A small number of more individualistic vassals made up a group called the vassal court, which served as the queen's council.</p>
<p>Soldiers patrolled the hive-city and its environs. They were suspicious of any outsiders, and considered nearby civilizations threats to their city.</p>
<p>The queen ruled the hive-city with absolute power. She was the one to rear the juvenile queens, feeding them royal jelly to convert them into fully-fledged queens when the time came to found a new settlement.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When a party consisting of Fox-at-Twilight , Liet Sagrin , Gargan Vathkelke Kaugathal , Davoren Hellsheart , and Billfora Brightbrows ventured into the former Netherese enclave of Negarath in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , they found an abeil hive-city constructed in its ruins.</p>
