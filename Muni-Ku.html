<h2>History</h2>

One day she noticed that the head cook had prepared a soup for the daimyo accidentally using poisoned mushrooms . Nodoby believed to Muni-Ku that as last resort ate herself the soup, saving the daimyo and condemning herself. In the hour of her death Muni-Ku was visited by the dwarf god Suku-nabiko that thank to a ghostly mouth insured in her mouth saved her, also granting to Muni-Ku a great knowledge of world. From that day Muni-Ku traveled across all of Wa, telling stories and legends.
