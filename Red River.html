<p>The Red River was a tributary of the River Ith in Tethyr .</p>
<p>This creek flowed from the Purple Hills to Myratma and was often flanked by lavenders, hence its former name, Lavender Creek . It received its newer name because its waters flowed red with blood from the First Siege of Myratma during the Reclamation Wars . The fields around it were likewise called the "Red River Fields".</p>
<p>The Red River formed the border between counties Elemetar and Vintor .</p>
