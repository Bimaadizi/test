<p>Sigil possessed considerable necromantic skill and probably a degree of surgical prowess as well.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among Sigil's wide array of magical items were a wand of lightning , boots of speed , ring of monster summoning III , and bracers of defense AC 3 .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nothing pleased Sigil more than constructing his own horrifying reanimated creations from the body parts of many creatures.</p>
