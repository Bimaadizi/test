<p>Reigar were a rare and powerful species of spacefaring celestials . They wandered across wildspace and the Astral Sea in search of anything that would inspire their creativity.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reigar were tall humanoids , standing anywhere from 6​ to ​7 feet (1.8​ to ​2.1 meters), with reddish-blonde hair and a willowy build. They were typically androgynous compared to humans ; with their females tending to be rather handsome and their males tending to rather beautiful. Additionally, all reigar were surrounded by a cloud of glowing, colorful motes that changed color in random patterns, which was called a glory.</p>
<p>Reigar valued self-expression and artistry, so a wide variety of jewelry, tattoos, make-up, hair styles, and many other forms of self-decoration were known to be used by the reigar. There was no distinction between sexes or social status involved in this, but rather was merely an expression of their creativity. They considered the art of war to be the highest level of creative expression.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Reigar valued art and artistry above all else, and spent all of their time in pursuit of their artistic ideals. However, their dedication to art precluded any care for morality or even kindness— reigar were known to favor spells that killed slowly, such as cloudkill , over spells that killed quickly, like fireball , in order to enjoy watching their victims writhe, gasp, and beg. Such mottoes as "Art for art's sake", "The ends justify the means", and "Anything for art, nothing without style, and everyone for himself", had all been applied to them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Reigar were highly intelligent, creative, and inventive. They were also powerful spellcasters and adept crafters of magical objects. When spellcasting, they were known to use magic from all of the schools, although they often disdained illusions as they disliked making false images.</p>
<p>Their glory made them harder to hit with attacks and also made them highly resistant to spells. It was said that a glory would be darker when a reigar was displeased, and lighter when they were pleased.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Reigar only entered into combat if their servitor helots and lakshu were defeated, and then relied on their shakti . However, their combined intellect, spellcasting, and shakti made them exceedingly dangerous.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Each reigar carried with them a taralith , to which only they could attune . This article of jewelry allowed them to conjure forth a golem that appeared exactly like themself.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Reigar were solitary individuals who valued their creativity and individuality, and cared almost nothing for each other. They lived on their esthetics , biological spelljammers that they created long ago, and which provided for their basic needs. There was only one reigar per esthetic, with the crew of each ship being composed of lakshu and helots. The lakshu also served as bodyguards, warriors, and shakti repairers, as the reigar disliked repairing items, saying it cramped their style.</p>
<p>Since the esthetics could not travel through the phlogiston , the reigar used talismans of the spheres , magic items near artifact-level in power, to travel between crystal sphere. Reigar where known to dwell in Realmspace , Krynnspace , Pirtelspace , and the Astromundi Cluster .</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Reigar were incredibly rare and disinterested in the larger goings-on of the multiverse. However, they were known to not get along with the neogi , who referred to them as "damn liars", and the clockwork horrors , which the reigar thought of as "bad art". Conversely, the aperusa people adored the reigar, although the reigar themselves did not particularly care about them. The reigar were also known to dislike the dohwar , saying that the creatures "dress to make one ill".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the distant past, the lakshu and the reigar became allies, with the reigar appropriating the lakshu as a work of art, which entailed the reigar making the lakshu species have a uniform appearance.</p>
<p>Sometime after that, about a millennia ago, reigar travelling off-world using their esthetics destroyed their homeworld using weapons of unimaginable power, having no concern for those on the ground, all in pursuit of the ultimate artistic expression of warfare and a plot to create the most beautiful display of carnage the multiverse had ever seen and will ever see. This cataclysmic event came be known among the reigar as the 'Master Stroke'.</p>
<p>Since the destruction of their homeworld, the few remaining Reigar wander across the Astral Sea in search of insight for their artistry.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The reigar were sometimes credited with creating or at least teaching other species about art and beauty; such stories (which named species such as the elves , dwarves , and tinker gnomes ) also said that the species they taught forgot most of it.</p>
<p>The reigar were also said to have invented spelljamming helms , and that they were the suppliers for the arcane . While they may have invented spelljamming helms, the latter part of that rumor was unlikely as the reigar disdained manufacturing anything, like most repetitive processes.</p>
<p>It was also said that the arcane would bow to reigar and do what the reigar told them. The same was also said of mind flayers , although it was hotly denied by that species. The reigar also claimed to have created the zodar on a whim, but this was questionable at best.</p>
