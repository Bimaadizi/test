<p>The Grey Chimera was a franchise of inns located in the countries of Unther and Mulhorand in the Old Empires during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The chain of inns was founded by an adventurer named Jehokim who used the horde of treasure he found to retire from the life of the adventurer and found his first inn. By the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , there was a Grey Chimera located in every major city throughout Unther and Mulhorand. Jehokim rented out these locations to others who each paid him a share of the profits.</p>
