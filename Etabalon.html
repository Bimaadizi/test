<p>In early fall of 1372 DR , one of the inhabitants of Etabalon, a winged and horned humanoid wizard named Mogdor embarked on a quest of retrieving his stolen servant, the imp Sujit . Were he ever successful, Mogdor was ready to step through a gate back to the icy planes of Etabalon with his recaptured servant. That was not to be however. Instead of retrieving Sujit, Mogdor received a package that held an angry imprisoned demilich , Extallimix , who swiftly destroyed the planar wizard with a flurry of powerful magics.</p>
