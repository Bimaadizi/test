<p>Clusterfang was a poor translation into Common of a particular deepspawn 's given name. It operated in the southern Sword Coast and Vilhon Reach regions in concert with the Twisted Rune . No one who knew of its existence could guess at why Clusterfang had allied itself with this organization of evil magic-users, but it obviously saw some benefit of doing so.</p>
<p>Clusterfang laired under the city of Zazesspur , being the second deepspawn to do so.</p>
