<p>The Roundloaf was the second major bakery in the town of Eveningstar in Cormyr as of 1377 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The bakery was built to the south along the Temple Approach Way that ran past the local Temple of Chauntea , built atop a drained swamp, and continued towards the Dalelands .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Despite being established in the city that had another famous bakery, Eveningstar Bakery , the Roundloaf did not compete with Urda Malo‎‎ 's shop. Unlike the Eveningstar Bakery, the Roundloaf sold bread in bulk to traveling merchants, and the only type of bread Anthan Lokalarr made was a hard-crust roundloaf, coated in cinammon - oil -treated wax that served as a type of preservative, allowing the bread to travel great distances.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Roundloaf was built by Anthan Lokalarr in the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , after he left Selgaunt and relocated to Cormyr.</p>
