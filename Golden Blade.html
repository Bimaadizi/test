<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first emperor of the Li Dynasty ordered nine magical swords crafted for each of his generals and ordered them to conquer the world. Each blade was crafted to match the talents of its wielder. Over time, the swords were scattered and many were lost to history. Legend had it that the person who reunited the swords would usher in a new dynasty.</p>
