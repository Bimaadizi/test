<p>At'ar's Looking Glass was a sweltering and uniquely hazardous stretch of desert in Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The region was composed of what appeared to be a flat "sea" of small, multi-color polished stones that absorbed more heat from the sun than any other surface in the desert. It was so intensely hot that even camels had great difficulty traversing its surface without harming the pads of their feet. Any creature that collapsed upon At'ar's Looking Glass would literally be roasted atop the pebbled desert floor.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Atar's Looking Glass was located east of the Scimitar Spires mountain range, in the northeastern area of the Sword . It was roughly ovular in shape, stretching 140 mi (230 km) across from east to west, and 200 mi (320 km) north to south.</p>
<p>Sidelong travel across the region took four days on camelback.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The three borders of At'ar's Looking Glass not adjacent to the mountains were marked by low-cresting sand dunes.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The region was named after At'ar the Merciless , the Bedine goddess of the sun. According to Bedine legend, the god Kozah wielded the wind to keep it clear of all debris in order for At'ar to admire herself in the reflective pebbles that formed what thus referred to as her looking glass.</p>
