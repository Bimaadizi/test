<h2>History</h2>
<p>In order to honor his father's dying wishes, Xeleth orchestrated an orbital assault on a lone planet out in Wildspace . He took command of the Xaryxian armada, and seeded the planet with energy from Xaryxis , the dying star that lay at the heart of the Xaryxian Empire. In order to prevent his sister from claiming her portion of their birthright, he stranded her on the planet in the hopes her death would help restore the light of their dying star.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the princess, her ship was waylaid and she managed to join a group of adventurers and fled the doomed planet about a spelljammer . Prince Xeleth took his fleet in pursuit of his sister and her companions to Doomspace , and to the astral fortress of a mercane named Vocath . While it was unknown exactly how events played out, eventually the prince withdrew his fleet from Doomspace and retreated to his native system.</p>
<p>Prince Xeleth returned to the Temple of Light aboard the Xaryxian Imperial Citadel , in order to carry out his father's final wishes. He began to orchestrate the funeral services for his father, and remained poised to ascend as emperor of the Xaryxian Empire. Just before his ascension, he was confronted by the same adventurers that accompanied Princess Xedalli from their doomed planet.</p>
