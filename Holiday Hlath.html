<p>Lady Holiday Hlath was the heiress of the noble patriar Hlath family of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lord Orthagon was already an old man who was the leader of the family only symbolically. His matron daughter, Merrigold Hlath was making all financial and social family discussions in Orthagon's place. When the Absolute crisis arrived to the Gate, Orthagon Hlath was noted by the Cult of Bane as a vulnerable patriar through his beloved grand-neice Holiday, a young woman of insatiable gabling habits and an impressive collection of debts from all gambling dens between Stonyeyes and Sow's Foot neighborhoods.</p>
