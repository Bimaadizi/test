<p>The League of Malevolence was an order of evil adventurers that dedicated themselves to the constant acquisition of more and greater power.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The League was founded and led by Kelek , an egomaniacal sorcerer that fostered scant comradery or loyalty among its other members. It was kept together by shared feelings of greed and ambition, with the belief it would be mutually advantageous for all to work alongside one anotherâ€”until the time they could individually seize more for themselves.</p>
<p>These bonds were not strong however. The group's cleric Zargash intended to eventually take over leadership of the League by force, while the thief Zarak was detested by every member, to they point where they held no regard for his wellbeing. The warlock Skylla even abandoned the group, defecting from their ranks to expose one of their dastardly plots to a coven of hags .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The League took on any quest they believed would help them garner more power, no matter how detestable. On one occasion they sought to recover the horn of a unicorn that had been cleaved from its head.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>For a time the League dwelled within the Palace of Heart's Desire , the fortress of the archfey Zybilna , while she remained imprisoned within.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The League of Malevolence was always under threat by the company known as Valor's Call , a band of heroic adventurers that hunted down the League for their villainous ways.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime after its formation, Kelek led the League of Malevolence into the domain of Prismeer in the Feywild . He had somehow learned that the ruling archfey Zybilna was in fact Iggwilv , the adopted mortal daughter of Baba Yaga . Kelek and the League schemed to extort Zybilna into claiming a powerful arcane weapon from the wizard Ringlerun , who was traveling within Prismeer with Valor's Call. It was shortly thereafter that Skylla betrayed the group by revealing Kelek's plan to the Hourglass Coven , the three fey daughters of Baba Yaga that detested Zybilna for her wealth of power.</p>
<p>As the League of Malevolence entered into Zybilna's Palace of Heart's Desire , the hags of the Hourglass Coven readied a trap to freeze Zybilna in time. As the League confronted Zybilna, the hags of the Hourglass coven ensured that would be met by their rivals in Valor's Call. When the two groups met face to face, a terrible and epic battle broke out. The hags of Hourglass Coven used ensuing chaos to spring their trap, freezing Zybilna in temporal stasis by means of her own cauldron .</p>
<p>In the aftermath, the Hourglass Coven manipulated the remaining members of the League with protecting Zybilna's cauldron, ensuring her continued imprisonment.</p>
