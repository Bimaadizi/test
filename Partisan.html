<p>A partisan was a member of the spear family of polearms , being particularly similar to the spetum and ranseur in design, to the point that it was not uncommon to confuse them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Partisans consisted of spear , with a long reach courtesy of a shaft that measured 8‒10 ft (2.4‒3 m) in length. The heads of these spears were double-edged and large enough to support engraving and ornamentation. Directly below this spear head, two flukes or " axe -like spikes" protruded diagonally from the base.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>This weapon was primarily used for thrusting at and piercing opponents', but the two flukes protruding from below the spearhead gave the weapon greater utility of cutting and slashing attacks. They also improved the partisan's penetrating potential, offered a defensive potential to the user, and could be used to catch and break an opponent's weapon.</p>
