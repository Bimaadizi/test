<p>The Trielta Hills laid to the north-east of Triel and north-west of Hardbuckler in the Western Heartlands in the Backlands , as the region was called by the humans of the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Trielta Hills was an area of pastoral and idyllic rolling hills, spotted with rocky outcroppings, tiny farming settlements, shallow close-to-the-surface "scratch mines," and an occasional fortified hold. The hills were crossed by a lesser-used northern winding branch of the Dusk Road .</p>
<p>The hills were among locations linked through the magical transportation network known as the Trail of Mists .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>They were home to many communities of rock gnomes and a few halflings , as well as three communities of orcs by 1492 DR . The entire Trielta Hills region was not menaced by raiders or warlords, dragons , or more sinister villains. There were not much to rob, pillage, or conquer. Despite their cruel culture, the orcs were seemingly uninvolved in any warfare, occupying at least one fortress in the region. Those who lived in the hills preferred calm and seclusion with periodically-discovered silver and gold deposits in the hills by the local miners. This led to inevitable small gold rushes, referred to as "gold on the brain." by the locals. But the strikes didn't last long. When words of such veins spread, it attracted dozens of adventurers and fortune-seekers who were seen as a blight by the locals. Because of the small volume of these mining discoveries, no nation or trade consortium cared to claim the land or set up large-scale mining operations.</p>
<p>Despite the idyllic nature, the Trielta Hills still had some danger. The rumors and news of precious metals attracted small-time crooks and thieves to the area, and of course, there were hungry monsters found in the hills. Sometimes dangerous creatures from the nearby Forest of Wyrms were on the prowl in the hills.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>There were no rumors of lost kingdoms, wizards towers, ruined holds or any such thing about the Trielta Hills, making them almost unique for their normality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime circa the Year of Netted Dreams, −320 DR , a collection of lizardfolk tribes called Kalran , based out of the Serpent Hills , attacked the rock gnome settlements in the Trielta Hills. The surviving gnomes, fearing further invasion, fled their homes.</p>
<p>During the Return of the Archwizards of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the last three free of the deadly phaerimm came from the Trielta Hills, leading a force of hobgoblins and illithids towards Evereska .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, the Trielta Hills were still peaceful with an occasional spout of trouble. One band of marauding lizardfolk was found in the area, who took a gnomish family hostage. But the crisis was averted by a local halfling sheriff and a band of local militia.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the growing power of the Cult of the Absolute planned on co-opting the orcs of the Trielta Hills into their ranks. Agent Mhoss , True Soul 26, was set to the Ringfork Stronghold but was dismembered by the stronghold's ruler – Lord Heradd as the simple negotiation attempts were seen as a sign of weakness by orcs. The second recruitment attempt was sending Sir Yax of Scornubel , another True Soul, who was intimately familiar with the orcish culture. Sir Yax was accompanied by two ogres and issued a challenge to Lord Heradd, using the death of True Soul 26 as an excuse. Yax was to defeat the orc ruler and force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute; in return, the cult was planning on offering Heradd help in subjugating the other two orcish tribes in the Trielta Hills.</p>
