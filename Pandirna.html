<p>After leaving the city, Pandirna and the Elturian tieflings were forced to seek asylum at the Emerald Grove after they were harried by goblin attacks while traveling west from Elturel to Baldur's Gate along the Risen Road .</p>
<p>While on guard duty in the tieflings home in the grove known as the Hollows , Pandirna hoped to gain an advantage over would-be goblin attackers and drank some unknown potion given to her by Ethel . While the brew offered her tremendous strength and bravery, it briefly left her with no feeling in her legs.</p>
