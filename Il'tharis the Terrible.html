<p>Il'tharis the Terrible was a gray slaad summoned to a drow outpost beneath the Stonelands in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Il'tharis was summoned by the drow ritualist Vur'din alongside many other slaadi , as part of an operation led by Mistress Laerion'vyr . Il'tharis was kept enslaved to the will of Vur'din by a control gem, and if the summoner was slain and the gem broken, Il'tharis would simply leave the plane.</p>
