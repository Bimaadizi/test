<p>Fluorspar , also called fluorite , was a soft, easily workable stone found in many colors. The pink and red varieties were sometimes called cabra stones .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ornamental stones cleaved easily to form faceted gemstones, but this treatment was reserved for small samples and specimens of the most popular colors: pale blue, green, yellow, purple, pink, and red. A purple-and-white banded variety known as archon or Blue John was mined in large blocks and used for carving. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp, with the higher valued stones tended to be the red and pink varieties. Fluorspar was often confused for amethyst , however, unlike amethyst, fluorspar was soft, easily scratched, chipped, and even burned.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Purple fluorite was commonly found in the Underdark , in places of extreme darkness.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Only larger specimens of fluorite were suitable for extracting from the depths of earth.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>All varieties of fluorspar gave off a faint green glow when invisible creatures or objects were within 20 ft (6.1 m). Fluorspar did not react to ethereal objects or creatures, nor to things or beings merely disguised.</p>
