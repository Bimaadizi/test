<p>The Council of Guilds ran the daily affairs of Daggerford in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Imitating the masked Lords of Waterdeep , the council members wore masks and shrouded themselves in robes to hide their identities at council meetings, but everyone in Daggerford knew who the council members were.</p>
<p>The council consisted of the guildmasters of the town's trade guilds, including the Watermen's Guild, the Heralds' and Runners' Union, the Pleaders' Consortium (lawyers and attorneys), blacksmith's guild, Merchant's Guild, Jeweler's Congress, Whitesmiths' Guild, Tailors' Federation, Tanners' Council, Physicians' Order, Taverners' Confederation, Scribes' Friendship, Sorceller's Encapsulate, Farmers' Society, Animal Handlers' Affiliation, and Carpenters' League, and likely not the self-styled guilds of the Thieves' Brotherhood and the Fence's Syndicate. The council also included the head of the militia, the duke's master-at-arms (though not the duke himself), and the chief priests of the town's four primary religions: Chauntea , Lathander , Tempus , and Tymora .</p>
