<p>Xainlaphar was a mad mage and one of the Red Wizards of Thay , who lived in the 9 th and 10 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xainlaphar's place in history was cemented by his proclivity for turning the heads of his slain enemies into enchanted items later to be named Xainlaphar's flying skulls . These magic weapons functioned in a similar manner to the skull trap spell but offensively. Xainlaphar created a number of these skulls before dying in the Year of the Watching Raven, 913 DR , leaving behind more than a half of the total number unused. Soon after, Xainlaphar's flying skulls were claimed by Xainlaphar's enemies—a cleric and a paladin of Helm . The Helmites intended to destroy these foul weapons, but at least forty of the flying skulls were stolen on the way to Sembia . Xainlaphar's legacy still existed as of the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
