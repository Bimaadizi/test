<p>Gharrent , Jhaamdath 's Fourth City of the Sword , was one of main cities in the ancient Jhaamdathan empire.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Fourth City was a few days west of the First City, Naarkolyth , just south of Golmuth and the Orsraun Mountains . After its destruction, it lay in the Selmal Basin beneath the waters of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gharrent was founded in −5425 DR as the fourth of Jhaamdath's cities, followed the same year by nearby Golmuth .</p>
<p>Jhaamdath entered into a period of imperial conquest in the Year of Overflowing Casks, −276 DR , which resulted in aggressive deforestation of the Chondalwood and the slaughter of the Nikerymath elves . The elves responded in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR by performing a High Magic ritual that caused a great wave from the Inner Sea to wash over the Cities of the Sword and destroy the core of Jhaamdath. Gharrent remained a sunken ruin hidden in the Reach, with its lost psionic artifacts slowly affecting the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The sunken lands of Jhaamdath were suddenly revealed by dropping sea levels following the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . This was almost as quickly reversed in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering that hid the ruins once more.</p>
