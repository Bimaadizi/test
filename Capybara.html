<p>Capybaras were large rodents found in Maztican swamps and jungles.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Although slow and lumbering on land, capybaras were relatively fast swimmers, and could hold their breath underwater for up to eight minutes.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Capybaras lived in close proximity to ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, marshes, or swamps, and typically didn't stray over 100 yards (91 meters) away from a body of water.</p>
<p>While groups of up to eight were most common, some capybaras traveled in herds of over 50.</p>
<p>Tabaxi hunted capybaras for food.</p>
