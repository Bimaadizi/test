<p>Sothal was Sheik Kassim Arslan 's favourite slave as of 1356Â DR . She was a very perceptive, bright, and loyal girl.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Sheik used to alk to her while he sorted out things in his mind. Sothal was present while the Sheik had an audience with the adventurers who ultimately released Martek .</p>
<p>She was aware of several things regarding the oasis. She knew some within the tribe had returned to worshiping idols, rather than Anu; she also believed that some in the Sheik's guard plotted to assassinate him as soon as he went out to search for the princess, and someone in court was a party to this plot.</p>
<p>She also believed the reason why Tolnus Granicus of the Sandvoyagers' Guild had not been seen for some time was that he had been the victim of foul play.</p>
