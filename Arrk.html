<p>Arrk was a well-known troll mercenary who operated in the Lake of Steam region in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>While he was smaller than normal trolls, Arrk was a bit more intelligent (though still possessing a quite short attention span) and dependable. Arrk had a disturbing habit of licking his sword, which was cursed to continually bleed, whenever he was nervous or bored. He also had poor, trollish hygiene.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Arrk was born to a troll tribe at the Neth Stand . As he was somewhat diminutive within his tribe, Arrk was often a victim of their cruelty and fought to survive until he eventually chose to leave. After stumbling across and joining a group of bandits, he discovered a true knack for the work.</p>
<p>However, finding the compensation of looting to be less than he wished, Arrk began working in a mercenary company. In this role, he was quite successful and became well known around the Lake of Steam area, though not popular.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Arrk worked for anyone who had the money, provided the job didn't take more than a tenday , as he soon grew distracted and irritated with the company of other people. Thus he often found work as a caravan guard or bodyguard in hostile lands, and occasionally hired on as muscle for adventuring companies. This work allowed him to succumb to his natural bloodlust.</p>
<p>While he was known to reliably hold up his end of a bargain, Arrk had the bad habit of eating people who didn't do the same, ensuring they paid him or didn't rob him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Along with his +1 spell storing greatsword , which possessed an inflict serious wounds spell and was cursed to continually bleed when drawn, Arrk carried with him two masterwork throwing axes , a chain shirt , and a gold necklace that acted as a ring of feather falling .</p>
