<p>Ebenfar was an empire in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn that lasted from the 1 st to the 4 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Ebenfar Empire stretched south from its capital city of Ebenfar in the High Moor to encompass the Chionthar Valley .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The empire was founded shortly after the Year of Purloined Power, 34 DR , when Verraketh Talembar found the Shadowstar in the High Moor . This mysterious meteorite transformed him into the " Shadowking " as he gathered an army of shadow-spinners and began a campaign of conquest against nearby Netherese and Talfiric populations. The new realm used the power of shadow magic to steadily gain strength and territory over the following decades.</p>
<p>After King Terpenzi of neighboring Najara received a vision in the Year of the Faithful Oracle, 89 DR , foretelling his own death at the hands of the Shadowking, he made preparations to go to war against Ebenfar. He assembled a massive army of ophidians and yuan-ti , and in the Year of the Moor Birds, 90 DR , they attacked. However, the forces of Najara were beaten back all the way to their capital, Ss'thar'tiss'ssun , which was destroyed by Ebenfar's armies and its ruins cloaked in wards . With his kingdom destroyed and people scattered to the Serpent Hills , Terpenzi led his remaining armies into a final clash that resulted in his destruction. The battlefield on which he was defeated came to be the namesake for the Fields of the Dead . The forces of Ebenfar would continue to harass the surviving serpentfolk of Najara for centuries, and stymied their efforts to reestablish a realm of their own.</p>
<p>Under the continued reign of the Shadowking, the empire would go on to persecute its Talfir subjects, including the nobility. In the Year of the Executioner, 140 DR , a large group led by Gwynneth would flee across the Sea of Swords , becoming the ancestors of the Ffolk people of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<p>The Shadowking would eventually become imprisoned beneath what would become Iriaebor . Without him, the empire of Ebenfar collapsed in the Year of the Miscast Shadow, 323 DR . Its human -ruled successor states continued to rule the Western Heartlands, but were steadily undermined by the resurgent Najara.</p>
