<p>Snow golems were a type of golem made from snow.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snow golems were a mound of snow animated by magic that could be sculpted in any shape their creators wished. They often resembled white marble statues of humanoids wearing terrifying helmets .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Snow golems were immune to the cold and were unaffected by poisons. They were also immune to charm, fear, paralyzation, petrifying or poison -based effects and spells. If it was attacked by a cold-based effect or spell, it absorbed the magical energy and used that to heal any injuries. Spells that altered the form or structure of a creature had no effect on snow golems. In addition, they were not hurt by mundane weapons, which only harmlessly passed through them, but only by magic weapons . They were, however, very vulnerable to any heat source, mundane or magical.</p>
<p>Although incapable of speaking, snow golems were usually accompanied by a haunting sound of mournful wind.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, a snow golem used its weight to slam into a target. They also used snowballs as a ranged weapon, possibly from surrounding snow or created magically from their own bodies.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>It was rumored that snow golems who had freed themselves from the control of their masters and achieved free will could form small communities with others of their kind.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Snow golems were occasionally found in the cold reaches of the Domains of Dread , where they were employed by their creators as guards.</p>
<h3>Creation</h3>
