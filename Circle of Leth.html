<p>The Circle of Leth was one of the most powerful druidic hierarchies of Faerûn . They were the followers of the Nentyarch , and governed both the Forest of Lethyr and much of the surrounding lands in the Great Dale .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Circle of Leth was made up of three rings. Five high druids made up the first ring, standing just below the Nentyarch ; they were the Nentyarch's advisors and the mentors to all below them. Nine druid masters made up the second ring, which searched out threats to the territory in their ward, commanding the Nentyar hunters in times of war. The third ring was made up of the Circle's initiates, low-ranking druids and novices serving amongst the Nentyar hunters or apprenticing to members of the first two rings.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Circle of Leth protected the woods and lands under their care from wanton cutting and oversettlement, as well as from overly extensive furring and trapping activities. People from Thesk knew better than to enter the Forest of Lethyr , considering it to be under the protection of the Circle of Leth.</p>
<p>Following the fall of Narfell , the Circle of Leth took up the task of healing Dun-Tharos and the Rawlinswood . After the Rotting Man took control at Dun-Tharos, the Circle of Leth stopped fighting against the loggers from Damara and Impiltur in the Rawlinswood. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Circle of Leth was working with local treants around Fortress Narder to resettle healthy trees and then wipe clean the blighted land around the fortress. They also guarded the Mucklestones .</p>
<p>Additionally, the Circle of Leth was the most important of the informal powers in the Great Dale, acting as its only unifying force in times of war, and preventing them from being at each other's throats in times of peace. In this position, they were central to fighting off the Rotting Man's forces.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Nentyarch ruled from his seat at Dun-Tharos until 1371 DR , when the Rotting Man successfully displaced them, forcing the circle to relocate to the Forest of Lethyr . As of 1497 DR , the Nentyarch remained there.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The druids of Leth were the only ones guarding the secret of the power of the stone markers at Bezentil .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Circle of Leth had often clashed with the king of Damara over logging rights. Nentyar hunters carried out the commands of the Circle. By 1497 DR , the Circle of Leth may have counted some shifters amongst their numbers, or perhaps as their servants.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Last Hunt, 722 DR , the Great Druid of Leth took up the title of Nentyarch, and raised a new druidic castle, The Close , atop the overgrown ruins at Dun-Tharos.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Helm, 1362 DR , the Rotting Man came to the Rawlinswood for the first time. In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , servants of the Shadowmasters attempted to frame the rangers of the Forest of Lethyr for killing Lord Uthrain ; they were stopped by a band of adventurers. In 1368 DR , a plague spread through the land, driving treants insane. The Rotting Man's army took Dun-Tharos on 1371 DR , expelling the Nentyarch, who regrouped in Yeshelmaar.</p>
