<p>A shield of missile attraction , also known as a missile attractor , was a variety of cursed shields that increased the likelihood of being targeted by missiles, such as arrows , bolts , and darts .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These shields appeared as highly magical shields of the useful variety, often seeming to be enchanted shields of some sort, until that was, the moment the bearer entered combat at their true powers revealed themselves.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once engaged in combat, the powers drew missiles to them, increasing the likelihood of being targeted by missiles to either double, or sometimes even triple, that of normal opponents. For the user of the shield however there were no indication that this missile storm was anything but bad luck.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deep in a hobgoblin lair near the city of Phlan in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , there lay a well-guarded treasure chest containing the two great treasures of a ring of contrariness , and a Missile attractor , amongst a paltry sum of coins. In Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR in the castle wall protecting the citadel of the Witch-King of Vaasa , a discarded Missile Attractor shield lay among the remains of those consumed by the purple worm trapped inside the wall.</p>
