<p>Tlanchass , or Hailstorm , was a gold dragon , and once the consort of Archveult Tattercloak .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tlanchass sometimes took the guise of a beautiful human woman. She'd taken this habit sometime before 681Â DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tlanchass and Archveult Tattercloak , then a student of the Seven Mages , departed Myth Drannor in the Year of the Zombie Lords, 681 DR , flying out of Sixstars Intersection on Greengrass . She revealed her true form there.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR , Archveult was known to live with her, and she was known to lair somewhere in The Vast , within a network of caverns that contained some shallow water, with an entrance hidden in the basement of what resembled a lonely cabin. After Archveult's death fighting an unknown dragon , she spent a day mourning his death over the city of Raven's Bluff ; the tears she shed became the Tears of the Dragon . At dusk, she left for the west, and was never seen again; her hoard was still unfound as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>Afterwards, she was said to have taken up residence in Evermeet , per Elminster . Other sources corroborated this datum.</p>
