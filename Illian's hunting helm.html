<h2>History</h2>
<p>Illian's hunting helm was created sometime before the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR as a reward for the famed elven hunter Illian Willowdusk. This ill-fated item was a gift from a group of halflings who were saved by the hunter from an evil Malarite priest and his trained bloodthirsty beast. Since Illian left the hin shire, the enchanted helm served him well until he embarked on a great hunt, chasing a large stag during the elven holiday of Cinnaelos'Cor . As the stag rushed through a thick patch of briars, the hunter rushed after it. Illian's hunting helm got caught on the vegetation, and with a loud snap, the hunter's neck was broken. His body was discovered the following day, still stuck in the shrubbery.</p>
<p>By 1281 DR, Illian's hunting helm had fallen into the hands of the drow trader Nym in the underground stronghold of Dorn's Deep in the mountains of the Spine of the World .</p>
