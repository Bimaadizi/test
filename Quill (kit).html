<p>Quills were specialty priests of the Church of Oghma who collected and recorded knowledge.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Given the amount of time spent recording various forms of knowledge, quills were usually well-versed with the history of their region.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Quills prided themselves on their diligence to their duties. They usually possessed an impressive memory and had a pleasing speaking voice.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Quills usually had all of the items required to write magical clerical scrolls .</p>
<p>Spells from both the combat and necromantic spheres were denied to a quill, nor could they turn undead .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Quills dressed similar to holy singers with a white tunic and pants and a black gold -trimmed vest. Their hat was small and box-like. Many quills also wore a sleeve protector on the forearm of their writing arm to protect their clothes from ink stains. These were sometimes decorated and served as a badge of office.</p>
<p>They spent very little time with martial training, thus they usually only carried smaller weapons, such as daggers . Lighter armor such as leather armor could also be worn.</p>
