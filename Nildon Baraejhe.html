<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a member of the Zhentarim who worked with Calivar Murpeth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Nildon Baraejhe was at a revel in Warmfires House , Shadowdale , where Calivar Murpeth, a Zhentarim, tried to poison the scrivener Maervidal Iloster . While their guest drank wine with saisha poison in it, Nildon explained that the additive was made of several different herbs . The scrivener immediately ran off for the jakes, with Baraejhe moving too slowly to block him. Later, he joined Calivar Murpeth upstairs, as they began the interrogation of Talantha , apparently a local sex worker who may have aided Maervidal in escaping. He took the disappearance of the scribe in stride.</p>
<p>He later took part in the torture of Talantha himself, giving her a few slaps first. After she revealed herself to be Storm Silverhand and Harpers burst into the room, all of the Zhentarim in the room were captured, including Nildon. (They hadn't really poisoned Maervidal Iloster either; unknown to them, he was actually Storm Silverhand in disguise too. )</p>
