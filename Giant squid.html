<p>A giant squid was a rare, gargantuan, and powerful squid .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These squids were similar to the standard mollusks that posed no threat to society. Giant squids, however, were dangerous hunters, and would attack anything they encountered, even ships. They were absolutely huge, measuring over 60 feet (18 meters) long, and had ten powerful tentacles. Giant squids were protected by a hard shell, but were vulnerable in other areas.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Giant squids were excellent and fast swimmers, and able to jet away at extremely quick speeds.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Such creatures mainly attacked by constricting their foes with their strong tentacles and biting them. It was possible for these squids to have their tentacles severed, and if so, they grew back within a few days. If they were losing a fight, they were able to emit huge inky clouds and swim away.</p>
<p>Many sailors believed that many vessels had little chance of surviving a giant squid attack, with stories abounding of the mollusks snapping galleons in half or dragging whole ships to the bottom of the ocean. However, in reality most giant squids fell short of accomplishing such impressive feats.</p>
<h2>Sub-Species</h2>

<p>Beyond the Prime Material , giant squids were known to inhabit the Abyssian Ocean and the Fated Depths , a water-based fiendish plane of limitless depth.</p>
