<p>The Many-Fanged Serpent was a mercantile secret society that operated out of the town of Purskul in the Zehoarastria region of Amn , several centuries prior to the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Many-Fanged Serpent held clandestine meetings in the Owlroost Head Inn of Purskul. Back then, the inn bore a different name, and the phrase "Owlroost Head" , the name of a certain hill, was used as the secret society's password. The meetings of the Many-Fanged Serpent were attended by merchants and laborers and planned attacks against unjust treatment and price-gouging by the visiting traders, merchants, and corrupt rulers. These planned actions were often referred to as "Serpent striking."</p>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR, the Many-Fanged Serpent was presumed disbanded, but every time Purskul was shaken by vandalisms, mercantilism-related murders, or other trade disturbances, the locals attributed these acts to the Striking Serpent. The swearing "By the Serpent!" remained very common in Purskul.</p>
<p>It was believed that the largest dining hall of the Owlroost Head Inn was constructed atop a buried cache of money stolen by the Many-Fanged Serpent.</p>
