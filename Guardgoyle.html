<p>Guardgoyles were constructs created by Zhentarim wizards to protect their treasures.</p>
<p>They resembled baby gargoyles , hence their moniker, and their small stature (2 feet tall/long) allowed them to hide amongst a wizard's possessions. It waited ready to fly out and strike if it sensed a presence in the room it was guarding that wasn't its creator or one of the five people it could be programmed to not attack.</p>
<p>If not destroyed, the magic animating them would last as long as their creator lived. Any repairs that they needed could be administered with a single stone shape spell. Due to these facts and that they only cost around 1000 gold pieces worth of raw materials to create, guardgoyles were cheap and effective guardians.</p>
<p>Greater guardgoyles tended to be between 4â€“6 feet tall and lacked the ability to fly. They were also much more expensive to create and required much more powerful magic to animate them.</p>
