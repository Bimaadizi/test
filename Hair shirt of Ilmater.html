<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The magical hair shirt allowed the wearer to cast cure serious wounds once a day, but only on someone other than the wearer, in accordance with the teachings of Ilmater.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>In addition to the woven horsehair, a hair shirt required the spells barkskin and cure serious wounds .</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>These hair shirts were typically only fashioned and worn by the followers of Ilmater. They preferred to use the shirt's healing power to alleviate the suffering of others.</p>
