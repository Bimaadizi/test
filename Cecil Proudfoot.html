<p>Cecil Proudfoot was a halfling who lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He spent some of his time at the Broken Crown inn, located along the High Road north of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Neverwinter was being rebuilt in the 1470s DR, following the cataclysmic eruption of Mount Hotenow in the 1451Â DR , numerous bands of halflings made their way to the city. Unfortunately many of the halfling caravans were assaulted by bandits and their belongings were scattered across the High Road.</p>
<p>To aid his fellow Hin , in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Cecil identified the sites of recent attacks and sought out a fellow halfling adventurer to recover the supplies and building materials left behind, including construction cobblestones, vittles, and barrels of some liquid for the Lionheart Clan . With these, halfling immigrants to Neverwinter would build new homes. Cecil even learned of a small band of displaced ghostwise halflings , led by Gilern Ghostwise , and had the adventurer find them so they could help each other against local marauders.</p>
