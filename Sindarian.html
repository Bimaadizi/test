<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the town of Mossbridges held its First Annual Year-End Festival , a weekend gala on Baron Darkarrow's estates centered around viticulture. Hearing that the festival was holding a wine judging contest, wherein the winner would be awarded an exclusivity contract with Mossbridges and become the sole wine sold there for the next twenty years, Sindarian decided it was financially worthwhile to participate. They chose to send Trendel P. Butterworth as their representative and Midnight Star , their best selling wine, as their submission.</p>
