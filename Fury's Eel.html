<p>Fury's Eels were huge demonic fish-like creatures that seemed to originate from Fury's Heart .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fury's Eels were long eel -like monstrosities with sharp teeth. When fully opened, its maw was big enough to swallow a human -sized object with ease. It possessed fins located on the sides of its head. Its body produced electricity that damaged things that came in contact with them. The creature reached huge sizes, thought to be about 120 feet (37 meters) in length by those who'd observed it.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>It was more intelligent than a typical fish, although it was not as intelligent as a human.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>It was immune to damage from non-magical weapons. Its own electrical ability had the capability of hurting others of its own kind.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>It seemed to consume meat and it readily consumed Fury's Grubs when offered to them, which also appeared to be native to Fury's Heart.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Red Wizard Marek Rymüt created the pocket dimension of the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen by carving it out from Fury's Heart in the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR . He tamed the locale and killed much of the local wildlife that remained in the plane after it had been separated from Fury's Heart. He intended to use the demiplane as a nursery for his army of black firedrakes . After he began raising the drakes there, he came to realize that he hadn't completely eliminated all of the dangerous wildlife in the demiplane and that these giant fish monstrosities were still living within a large lake in the middle of the demiplane. Most likely, these were creatures already present within Fury's Heart from the time before he had carved off the pocket dimension. Fury's Heart was the home of both the storm god Talos and the sea goddess Umberlee . Marek saw these demonic lightning eels as an opportunity and decided to try to tame them in order to use them for his own purposes.</p>
<p>The opportunity came the following year when the Shou merchant Ran Ai Yu refused his offer of magical transport back to Shou Lung from where she had been stranded in Innarlith and preferred to build a new boat instead. Marek transported two Fury's Eels into Innarlith harbor to attack the Jié Zuò in drydock while she and several others were present. In a fierce battle, Ran Ai Yu and those with her discovered they couldn't hurt the fish with their weapons. They succeeded in killing the two giant fish by driving swords into their jaws and then connecting a chain from one sword to the other while they were engaged in combat. An electrical arc then went from one fish to the other and caused them to both explode.</p>
<p>Marek Rymut accepted this loss, believing that he had still gained some knowledge by being shown a weakness in the fish, which he worked to try to fix.</p>
