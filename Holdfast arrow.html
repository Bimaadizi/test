<p>Holdfast arrows were types of enchanted ammunition most commonly used by Eldath -worshiping rangers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These special arrows often were decorated with blue and green ribbons and even flowers, to accentuate their peaceful nature.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Holdfast arrows were less effective in battle due to their non-combat and humane purpose. Even though they had a +1 enchantment, they dealt less damage than regular arrows and were often used to restrain rampaging beasts with minimal harm. Upon reaching their targets, holdfast arrows enveloped them in restraining vines, similar to those of the entangle spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Most commonly, these arrows were crafted by Eldathyn rangers from the Western Heartlands . In 1281 DR , these arrows could be found in Lonelywood and the wider Ten Towns area of Icewind Dale .</p>
