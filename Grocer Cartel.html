<p>The Grocer Cartel was a powerful guild of traders and retailers that influenced the food trade in ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The guild was led in a fair but unflinching manner by Ravenar Andarlis , who also owned Andarlis Transport . It had a heavy influence on the trade and transport of food in Netheril, and helped regulate prices and the economy in general. In Yeoman's Loft , it took a particular role in controlling the flow of goods acquired via spelljamming expeditions, which were often hotly competed for.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The guild's headquarters was found on Helm Road in Yeoman's Loft, and owned many other locations in that city and elsewhere, including Eileanar .</p>
