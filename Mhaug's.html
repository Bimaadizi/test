<p>Mhaug's was a shop in Lower Port , Skullport , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mhaug's provided undead labor for a fee. It was a small shop run by Mhaug , an annis hag .</p>
<h2>Goods & Services</h2>
<p>She acquired fresh bodies from various sources, including Leech's Quick Cures and Cryptkey Facilitations . She reanimated these corpses and offered them for sale as laborers and bodyguards. Her shop was notorious for its macabre display, where her wares—reanimated zombies —were hung by the neck from hooks outside the establishment. Due to the effects of decay and their prolonged exposure, these zombies developed distinctive physical traits, such as twisted necks and an awkward, shuffling gait. As a result, the citizens of Skullport dubbed them "Mhaug hogs."</p>
<p>The prices for Mhaug's zombies generally started at around 50 gp , with the cost varying based on the size of the corpse and the difficulty she encountered in the animation process. She was known to charge wealthier customers higher prices and had established ongoing business relationships with several notable local figures, including Dalagor the Cold . Mhaug was often seen outside her shop, either engaging in conversation with passersby or tending to a brazier where she slow-roasted questionable cuts of meat.</p>
<p>As of 1370 DR , Mhaug had recently expanded her enterprise by venturing into the brewing of "solutions"—a euphemism for poisons intended to resolve personal conflicts by eliminating the source of the problem. Mhaug's poisons, while sought after by those looking for discreet solutions, had certain limitations. Her poisons were expensive, and she offered no guarantees or refunds. They spoiled within a tenday if not stored in airtight containers, rendering them ineffective. Additionally, approximately 25% of the time, her poisons were inert and failed to work as intended. Despite these shortcomings, her reputation persisted, as many still sought her out for her unique services, fully aware of the risks associated with her wares.</p>
