<p>Hagga Shan , also called the Shadowmount Peaks, was a mountain range located in the northern region of the Hordelands along Yal Tengri .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This small mountain range was covered by snow for most of the year.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Hagga Shan sat along the southeastern edge of Yal Tengri, sheltering the Iceroot Forest from the harsh ocean winds.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Both Li lung and Copper dragons where to be found in the mountains.</p>
<p>Rarely one would encounter Aarakocra or Ki-rin living deep in the Shadowmount Peaks.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>Arongahurr , a fallen enclave of the Netheril that crashed at the east end of the mountain range.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Clan Herlinga a small community of dwarves lived within Hagga Shan, mining tin and selling it to merchants in Sossal . The nomads of the Endless Wastes acquired many natural resources from the mountain as well.</p>
<p>Contact between the two groups was rare, so rare that the nomads had a superstitious dread of "little men" in the mountains. The dwarves played on these fears as a joke, and to close deals, only further reinforcing the nomads' fear of the area.</p>
