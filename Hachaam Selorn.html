<p>Hachaam Selorn was the Arm-Captain of the Akh'Velahr of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hachaam was born in the Year of the Last Breath, 420 DR . At the start of the Weeping War, Hachaam was the primary field commander of the Akh'Velahr.</p>
<p>Sometime before the start of the Weeping War, the paladin Eadred and his commander Hachaam Selorn visited one of the ancient tombs in Glim-Gardens , the Cold Knight's Barrow, which was home to a powerful wight . Together the duo managed to slay the undead, but Hachaam was trapped in frozen stasis by the wight's final spell, appearing cold and eternally asleep. When the danger of the looming war became apparent, Eadred returned to the ancient barrow seeking the way to free the commander whose leadership was indispensable. He managed to take Hachaam's place in eternal slumber, freeing the Arm-Captain just in time for him to lead Myth Drannoor's forces against the invaders.</p>
<p>In Ches – Marpenoth of the Year of the Lost Lance, 712 DR , in a decisive battle that secured victory for Myth Drannor, Hachaam led the Cormanthor troops in reclaiming the ruins of the Elven Court . In Kythorn 1 – 14 , he led the Akh'Velahr in Darkwood to gain control of the region, with the objective of retreating there in the event of the fall of the city.</p>
<p>During the final fall of the city in the Year of Doom, 714 DR , Hachaam, together with Fflar Starbrow Melruth , organized the final fight against the occupying Army of Darkness troops.</p>
<p>At last, in Kythorn , the fiendish troops led by Aulmpiter took control of the Crownfrost Tower . Using a Blood War tactic, the yugoloth managed to entrap and kill Hachaam and Arm-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal .</p>
<p>Hachaam was laid to rest in the tomb located in the top level of the Dwarven Dungeons , the Halls of Light, before the Dungeons were sealed with the word of power by the survivors of the war who fled the fallen city shortly after.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Hachaam was one of many ghosts that haunted the ruins of Myth Drannor. He appeared in front of the heroes fighting to stop the Cult of the Dragon 's corruption of the city's mythal . The restless ghost implored the adventurers to recover a powerful enchanted blade he wielded in life, Faervian , from the drow of House Freth who were desecrating ancient tombs in search of powerful artifacts. When the adventurers retrieved the blade, Hachaam gifted them the recovered blade and aided them in recovering a more powerful sister-sword, Morvian , from a long-imprisoned demon Rivener .</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Paladin Eadred was one of Hachaam's subordinates who respected the Arm-Captain enough to sacrifice his life for his commander.</p>
<p>Hachaam alone continued to support the N'Vaelahr after they had rescued him in the early period of the war.</p>
