<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , a shipment of Royal Violet was brought to the Vast by Brandywine Furfoot , on the behest of Jolly Greenleaf , the proprietor of As the Vine Twines of the Bluff. Jolly believed that his decade-aged Royal Violet would win the wine-tasting competition, but Brandywine was worried about the low supply of the wine were to win. She sold a bottle for 180 gp and five gp per glass. Royal Violet Wine was entered into the wine-tasting competition during the year-end celebration of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR in Mossbridges , but it was unknown if it won.</p>
