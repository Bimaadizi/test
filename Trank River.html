<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Trank River originated in the Vanishing Hills and flowed southward for approximately 40 mi (64 km). As the waters of the river deposited into the dense vegetation in the lowlands north of the sea, they formed the Twilight Marsh , wetlands that appeared as if they were lit by the soft radiance of sunset.</p>
<p>As the waters continued streaming southward they flowed around the archipelago known as the Ringcurrent Islands , forming a circular eddy around them.</p>
<p>The Phlan Path crossed over the Trank River at the Trank River Bridge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the lizardfolk of the Twilight Marsh carried out a series of raids against the farms nestled along the shores of the river, abducting farmers to appease their black dragon master, Throstulgrael .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There were three notable farmsteads along the eastern bank of the Trank River, the Renon Farm , Alyin Farm , and the Tralio Farm .</p>
<p>The Crossing Inn was also situated at the east bank of the river at the point where it crossed the Phlan Path.</p>
