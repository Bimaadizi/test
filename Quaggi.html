<p>A quaggi was a structure found in Iulutiun and Angulutiun villages.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Traditionally, Iulutiuns gathered for communal feasts and celebrations in outdoor settings. However, during inclement weather, they resorted to using a quaggi, which was a feast house specifically designed for such occasions. The quaggi was a spacious dome, towering between 15​ to ​20 feet (4.6​ to ​6.1 meters) in height and boasting a diameter of at least 20 feet (6.1 meters). At the center of the dome, there was a prominent quidlirin , a communal hearth.</p>
<p>Inside the quaggi, two ledges constructed from snow served as seating arrangements. The first ledge, positioned along the interior wall, stood approximately 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, while a second ledge sat just below it, measuring around 2 feet (61 centimeters) in height. Typically, a village was equipped with one quaggi for approximately every hundred adults, ensuring ample space for gatherings and festivities.</p>
