<p>Great Bhaerynden , also referred to by the local gold dwarves as the Deepwilds , Deep Lands or simply the Deeps , was a domain of the Underdark located in the south-central region of Faerûn beneath the vast plains of Shaar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This region was the first homeland of the dwarves , in a cavern known as Bhaerynden . However, it was later invaded and conquered by the drow when they first ventured into the Underdark in search of a realm of their own, scattering the dwarves and sending them into exile. The drow renamed their new home Telantiwar , but this kingdom didn't last.</p>
<p>Less than two millennia later, around −7600 DR , for reasons that remained unknown well into the Present Age , after the drow had torn Telantiwar apart in a civil war great magical explosions rocked the cavern of Bhaerynden and the domed ceilings of its enormous vaults came crashing down. Many of the drow were crushed beneath rocks and rubble from the rock layer above. This great collapse laid ruin to many of the shattered dwarven cities the drow had seized for Telantiwar, opening the cavern up to the sky and creating what later became known as the Great Rift . Many scholars suggested the the drow had caused the collapse by weakening the cavern roofs through excessive tunneling and an over-reliance on magic to support the roof's weight. Many gold dwarves on the other hand believed the collapse was the work of their god Moradin , crashing his mighty axe down to destroy Telantiwar.</p>
<p>The drow nobles that survived this disaster gathered what people, slaves , and equipment they could before fleeing elsewhere in the Underdark to find a new place to call home.</p>
<p>Following this there was a hectic scramble in the Underdark to lay claim to new territory. Before long dwarves returned to their ancestral homeland and established the Deep Realm , staking their claim on both the Great Rift and much of the surrounding lesser caverns and tunnels. These dwarves would become the ancestors of Faerûn's gold dwarves.</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck Toril in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , great rifts opened up in the Underdark beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars , which in turn caused the collapse of great swathes of land. One of the casualties of this disaster was the Great Rift, whose western half collapsed into the deeper reaches of Great Bhaerynden, creating a huge canyon that was later dubbed Underchasm . Much of the communities in Great Bhaerynden were devastated in the wake of this formation, with numerous outposts and settlements becoming displaced. Many of the remaining drow realms in particular fell to ruin, such as Llurth Dreier . The thousands of drow that once called that city home scattered throughout Great Bhaerynden. Some moved to other drow holds, whilst others assaulted any place they thought they could conquer, with some even managing to take control of Underhome .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Gold dwarves lived in the Great Rift and a lot of the adjoining caves. They regularly patrolled the vast caves that were outside of their control. Occasional ambitious gold dwarves would attempt to establish homesteads or mining outposts, but within a year or two dangerous creatures that lurked within the recesses of the Great Bhaerynden would always drive them back. Beyond gold dwarves, duergar could be found scattered throughout the region.</p>
<p>Drow and half-drow held the cities of T'lindhet and Llurth Dreier. Halflings lived in Deepburrow in Great Bhaerynden. Earth genasi , urdunnir dwarves, and many creatures of elemental earth made their home in Earth's End . They were later joined by more genasi, as well as Halruaan ethnic humans , both fleeing from the destruction of Halruaa during the Spellplague. In the Lowerdark reaches of the Great Bhaerynden, it was home to aboleths , cloakers , deepspawn , the mysterious slyth , and horrid wildlife, such as giant spiders and night slugs .</p>
<p>Following the Spellplague, drow clans displaced from Llurth Dreier wandered the Underchasm. These drow were referred to broadly as the "wild drow", a moniker born from their stubborn refusal to cooperate with each other enough to build any sort of major settlement.</p>
<p>Unlike settlements in the Northdark , the cities of this region interacted more closely with the cities above ground.</p>
