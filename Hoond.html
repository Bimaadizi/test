<p>Hoond , known as the "Despoiler of Tombs" , was a notorious thief of Shussel in Unther , in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>When Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur and her dowry went missing in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Hoond of Shussel was one of three thieves named as suspects by High Suikh (king) Helbareim Alanasker , but was innocent. Hoond could well have gone looking for the real thief, perhaps deciding to have the loot as well as the blame.</p>
