<p>The first ivory horn of Valhalla , was created by the powerful bard of the Moonshae Isles named Falataer . The horn's summoned ivory shieldmaidens were used to test his students and copies of the horn were used as rewards. With years passing, ivory horns of Valhalla were copied and imitated. One such horn ended up in the hands of Skullcrusher some years before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . In his twilight years in the Neverwinter Wood , Skullcrusher kept the horn on his person, ready to summon all three ivory shieldmaidens to his defense if need ever arose.</p>
