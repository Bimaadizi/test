<p>Kled was an emotionally broken hobgoblin member of the Anti-Hag Support Group of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kled was a tall and masculine hobgoblin fighter with a red skin tone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kled encountered a hag and that encounter left him broken and terrified of red caps . Eventually, Kled met other hag victims, including Adrielle , Jatlo , and, possibly, were they to survive their encounters with Auntie Ethel , Hydrangea Wubb , Mayrina , and her zombified husband Connor Vinderblad . This group, which later became known as the Anti-Hag Support Group, found their way to the Lower City of Baldur's Gate, where they began planning and researching ways to end the hag menace.</p>
<p>Soon after, the green hag Auntie Ethel discovered the group working to save girls consumed by the hags as a method of procreation. It was revealed that Jatlo was not a dragonborn survivor but a shapeshifted red cap servant of the green hag. Secretly, Jatlo had smuggled an effigy into the Anti-Hag Support Group's hideout, old Garlow 's home in the Lower City . That effigy affected Mayrina, turning her into a sheep .</p>
