<p>Zun'thar the Unbound was a glabrezu demon summoned by the arcanists of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War , until the city was recovered in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zun'thar was summoned by desperate elves as a last resort defensive measure during the fall of Myth Drannor. Unfortunately, they failed to bind it properly and it simply slew them once it arrived. Zun'thar proceeded to remain in the Safehold of the Speculum until the Elven Crusade in 1374 DR , when the Elves of Cormanthor and Eilistraee's Wanderers arrived to retake the city. The overenthusiastic leader of the drow , Kelgoth Darksong , personally checked the Speculum for the Icon of the Elves , only to be slain by the resident monsters. A follow-up group found Kelgoth and broke into the Safehold, defeating Zun'thar and finishing Kelgoth's quest.</p>
