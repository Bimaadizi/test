<h2>History</h2>
<p>One night during Shandril 's initial absence in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Pardus praised Korvan's cooking in a way that offended his wife, Yantra. Though many in the inn were rooting for a fight, she simply called for a half-ration of boar to her husband, rather than what he preferred. Gorstag , winking, called him to the back under what he believed to be false pretenses, with the likely outcome of getting a full ration of deer .</p>
