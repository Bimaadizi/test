Decorative hats and headwear of various sizes were hung high on the shop's walls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The shop was open in the late 15 th century DR and was owned by Bristle – a tawny-furred tabaxi woman, and Brettons – a stout pudgy balding human male. Over the years, Brettons became acquainted with a charismatic con man and a rogue named Forge Fitzwilliam , the relationship that brought the rogue and his accomplices, Kira and Edgin Darvis , to the tailor's shop in search of finery to wear to a grand masquerade ball at the West Caraway Acres in Neverwinter 's countryside. The group was able to find costumes for the entire thieves' crew, along with masques to wear as part of the outfits.</p>
