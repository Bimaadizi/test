<p>Alabaster talisman was a powerful artifact amulet , recovered from the depths of Undermountain in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This talisman was a decorative implement made of white mineral, such as gypsum or alabaster . Its exquisite draconic design was unique because it was once a decorative piece affixed to the wall of an ancient king.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>After the alabaster talisman was reinforced and enchanted via magic to withstand even the hardest hits, it was given the ability to grant offensive boosts to the wielder. It increased the wielder's attack power. Additionally, if the wielder also possessed the alabaster orb , the two items reinforced each other's magics, further boosting the wielder's power, and temporarily increasing their chance to deal devastating and lucky hits at the beginning of battle. The items' power to grant lucky strikes was reactivated each time the wilder killed a creature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>History forgot the identity of the ancient king whose grand hall was decorated with elements that would eventually become the alabaster orb and alabaster talisman , but these items re recovered from Undermountain and magically enhanced sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR.</p>
