<p>The House of the Lion was luxurious festhall and the namesake of the moot on which it stood in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The House of the Lion stood on the eastern side of Lionsmoot , one of three major moots in Baldur's Gate, just southeast of the Watch Citadel . It was crossed by Sornbanner , that ran east, and Windspell Street that caressed the High Hall 's western walls.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>By the mid 14 th century DR , the House of the Lion had become a popular social club frequented by young Baldurian "blades" (young wealthy men of status and coin ) and "lacethroats" (socially bold young women of status, fashion, and wealth). The noble youths spent nights at the festhall socializing, coupling, gambling, imbibing, and dueling late into the night. The festhall was guarded by "waycudgels" who ended any rowdiness or troublemaking, sending youths to commit debauchery elsewhere.</p>
