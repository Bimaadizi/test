<p>Rose Keep was a trade enclave on the edge of Veltalar , in Aglarond .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>The enclave was walled with scuffed, mortared stone walls. Inside was a two story building and an attached three story tower with an observatory on top. Iron-reinforced oak gates lead inside. A large red tent is set up in the courtyard to sell items. There is an underground cellar only accessible by magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rose Keep was founded as a Thayan enclave early in the Era of Upheaval . It was the last enclave established before Szass Tam 's takeover of Thay. Originally overseen by four Red Wizards , it teetered on the brink of failure, partly due to two of the Red Wizards leaving to pursue their own interests and Levant leaving to pledge himself to Szass Tam. This left Dhenna to run Rose Keep by herself with a newborn daughter.</p>
<p>She ran it until her death in 1449 DR when her daughter Tharna took over. Tharna continued to run Rose Keep on her own but eventually sought partners in 1474 DR allowing two to buy-in but keeping a majority share for herself.</p>
