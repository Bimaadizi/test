<p>An awakened shrub was a rare plant creature found in the Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It looked like a potted plant that someone might place in their garden or living room. It had green leaves and dark brown bark, and had a dark-red clay pot .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Granted sentience by an awaken spell, [ speculation ] it could slink around the woods despite being in a pot and could speak Common while having no visible place where its sounds could come from.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, it is possible that the adventurers who slew Deathsleep the green dragon encountered the awakened shrub. Upon contact, the plant demanded that each of the adventurers name it before it would let them pass. After finishing this task, the shrub accepted one of the names, allowed the adventurers to pass and rewarded them with 1 gp .</p>
