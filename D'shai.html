<h2>Description</h2>
<p>D'shai was a large yuan-ti abomination with dark-red scale-covered body.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Serpentguard D'shai and several other serpentine abominations were left to guard a long-abandoned temple that once belonged to House Sauringar until they abandoned the worship of Sseth in favor of the interloper deity Zehir . The temple stood in the heart of the Samarlogh and hid the divinely enchanted Sauringar Tome . In 1374 DR , an infamous writer and explorer named Volothamp Geddarm sought lore to pen Volo's Guide to the Serpent Kingdoms , a book dedicated to Samarach . He asked a band of adventurers to infiltrate D'shai's temple to retrieve yuan-ti artifacts from its inner sanctum.</p>
