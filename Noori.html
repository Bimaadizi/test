<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1480s or early 1490s DR , Noori somehow managed to enter inside the Eye of the All-Father temple. However, she was on the verge of death by freezing.</p>
<p>Her chieftain Wormblod led a group of his berserkers plus an enslaved white dragon and a shaman to try to break inside the temple in order to find Noori. In truth, Wormblod only wanted the treasures inside.</p>
