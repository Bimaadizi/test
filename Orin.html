<p>Orin the Red was a changeling Bhaalspawn and a follower of Bhaal who served her god during the late 15 th century DR , by playing a significant role in the Absolute Crisis .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her true changeling form, Orin had grey-white skin and long blonde hair she kept in a single braid, the end of which was adorned with what resembled the head of a flail. She wore a suit of blood-red armor decorated with a metal belt and wore a circlet atop her head.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was one of the most sadistic and bloodthirsty individuals to ever stalk the Sword Coast . Her lust for murder and mayhem surprised even the most ardent devotees of the Lord of Murder. She believed attributing murder to Bhaal had to be done in an artistic manner, not realizing that Bhaal cared not for quality of murder, but of quantity.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other Bhaalspawn, Orin had the ability to transform into the avatar of Bhaal known as the Slayer .</p>
<p>As a changeling, she also had the ability to take on the appearance of other humanoids , and could deceive even their most loyal allies.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Orin performed her killings with two unique blades, the shortsword called Crimson Mischief and the dagger known as the Blade of the First Blood . She also carried with her Bloodthirst , the dagger wielded by the mortal Bhaal when he performed his first murders in the city of Baldur's Gate. She also wore a unique ring that allowed her to retreat from danger.</p>
<p>For a time, she was in possession of one third of the netherstone , which she kept embedded within the Blade of the First Blood .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Orin was born to a woman named Helena Anchev , a devoted follower of Bhaal, and Sarevok Anchev , Helena's own father and thus also Orin's grandfather. Sarevok was the child of Bhaal who orchestrated the iron crisis that plagued the Sword Coast in 1368 DR , just prior to the Bhaalspawn crisis that erupted in the Lands of Intrigue . However, Orin was completely unaware of her incestuous origin and the true reason for her mother's attempted murder.</p>
<p>She herself was served by a cadre of Death's Heads , unholy servants of the Lord of Murder.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orin was born from an incestuous union between Sarevok Anchev and his part-doppelganger daughter Helena Anchev, as Sarevok wanted to preserve Bhaal's bloodline and make a sacrifice for Bhaal. When she was aged 8, Helena attempted to murder Orin, which was said by Sarevok to be an attempt to become Bhaal's chosen. To Sarevok's surprise, Orin survived and killed her mother instead. Bhaal manifested and chose Orin as his favorite while Orin toyed with her mother's severed hand.</p>
<p>In her adulthood, Orin was a devoted servant of Bhaal who served directly under the individual known as the Dark Urge during the late 15 th century DR. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Dark Urge orchestrated a plot with two fellow chosen of the Dead Three ―Lord Enver Gortash and Ketheric Thorm —to rule the Sword Coast in the names of their gods. All the while, Orin bided her time for the right opportunity to take action and seize Bhaal's favor for herself.</p>
<p>After the trio enslaved an elder brain beneath Moonrise Towers with the Crown of Karsus and fabricated the cult of the Absolute religious movement, Orin attacked her superior, inserted a knife into his skull, and implanted a modified illithid tadpole into his brain. She then took over his role as Bhaal's chosen in the plot, but unfortunately proved to be undisciplined. She continued to kill innocents in Baldur's Gate without restraint, seeking to further ingratiate herself to the god Bhaal.</p>
