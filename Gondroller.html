<p>Gondrollers were a type of humanoid -powered, three-wheeled vehicle developed by the Church of Gond that required relatively smooth trails.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These vehicles had soft, squashy fat tires and rear cargo beds.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Genuine gondrollers were rather rare and expensive, being only constructed and sold by temples of Gond . Those who saw them would often try to hire a smith to create them a knock-off, but even these were rare due to the difficulty of making the vehicle's necessary axles , wheels, and tires.</p>
