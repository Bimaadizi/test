<p>Umbriri were the practitioners of sword magic that originated from the returned empire of Netheril . Their artistry with the blade blended the martial skills of the Netherese with the shadow magic that permeated the culture of the Shadovar .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The most skilled umbriri were those shade who had been honing their skills to perfection for centuries. As of the late 15 th century the majority of these swordmages were those humans of Netherese descent, living within the empire in Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Even some Sembian warriors were entrusted enough by their shade lords to take on the way of the umbriri. There were a small number of these individuals who supported a liberated Sembia, using their skills in secret to this end.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Umbriri were adept at creating shadows that allowed them to make unseen attacks. They formed shadows that obscured the vision of their foes, granting them an edge in combat and concealing their allies from harm. These shadows could be made to take humanoid form, distracting opponents and granting an umbriri an opportune strike.</p>
<p>Over time, umbriri developed an inherent protection from necrotic energy.</p>
<p>The most masterly umbriri could actually actually take control over another individual by utilizing shadowy apparitions. The only limitation was the affected being could not be given any task that would harm themself.</p>
