<p>Submarines , also known as sub-marines or submersibles , were a rare form of watercraft designed to traverse the depths of seas and oceans. They were typically built by gnomes or at least operated by them.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Submersibles were described by some as looking like strange galleys , whilst others had designs inspired by marine life. Constructed from metal, they were entirely enclosed vessels, typically only having a single, trapdoor hatch to enter them from. Though some also had a second hatch to allow for diving into the water or entering from the water. Submarines tended to be able to accommodate most demihumans , though their dimensions were typically designed with gnomes in mind.</p>
<p>Being enclosed watercraft designed for underwater traversal, submarines were pressurized in order to keep water from leaking in and flooding them. They were designed to maintain an air supply, whether it be through a complex system of ventilation and machinery utilizing conjuration magic or by extending a metal tube above the water's surface to retrieve air. Additionally, some were designed without any form of interior lighting, as gnomes could just easily rely upon their darkvision .</p>
<p>These vessels were powered by a collection of complex and noisy machinery, sometimes quasi- magical in nature and typically kept within a room separate from the main command room. These machines were what allowed for submarines to ascend, descend, change their direction, and be propelled through the watery depths. With these engines being in separate rooms from the command deck, metal speaking tubes were put in place to allow for swift communication between the two. Consequently, such machinery necessitated having one or more engineers on a crew.</p>
<p>Besides the command room and engine room, submarines were typically large enough to have a handful of other rooms or quarters for the crew members. For viewing the watery depths outside a submarine, there might be portholes, circular or dome-like windows fashioned from glass or glassteel , typically within the command room. These rooms might also sport a "periscope", metal tubes that functioned similarly to spyglasses and could be raised or lowered at any time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point a gnomish submarine operating in the Trackless Sea had a run-in with the storm giants of Maelstrom . Pieces of the wreckage were kept by the giants in the fortress's study, while an apparatus of Kwalish that was recovered from the vessel's pressurized hold was placed within the royal treasury.</p>
