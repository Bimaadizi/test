<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1372 DR, the talisman, along with its original owner, shaman Rattlefang, could be found in the Wild Hills, several hours of travel away from the city of Daggerford . During that time, Rattlefang's gnoll prime warred with the ogres led by Guruk Bonesnap . Each of the feuding groups sought for a way to slaughter each other in order to claim a natural bridge over a deadly chasm for themselves.</p>
