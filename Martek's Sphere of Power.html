<p>Martek's Sphere of Power was the tool which Martek prophesised would have to be released so that the efreeti Pasha Khalitharius would be banished from Raurin forever. Though it was assumed to be an artifact, there was no such device: it was actually Martek himself.</p>
<h2>Legend</h2>
<p>According to legend, Martek had used the Sphere of Power to defeat Khalitharius in a magical battle, and that it had been buried with him. Martek had prophesised that his Sphere of Power would be needed to forever defeat Khalitharius; a scholar of Martek's prophecies, Aman Al-Raqib, secured the services of some adventurers in order to recover the Sphere in 1356Â DR after they accidentally teleported themselves to him with one of his devices.</p>
<p>There were references to Martek's Sphere of Power in an epic known by Roland the Minstrel , and the wizard Trifakas had come to the Tomb of Martek to acquire it. Each Pillar of Martek was part of a formation with other similar pillars, and at least one of them in each formation would contain a reference to the Sphere of Power; the Obelisk in the middle of Medinat Muskawoon also made reference to it.</p>
