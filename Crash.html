<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Cras, along with his two equally dimwitted friends, tiger katanga Rowr and korobokuru Budd , embarked on their adventures across the dangerous Living Jungle. As the civilized inhabitants of the jungle were menaced by the evil spider katanga – the Mother of a Thousand Young , the trio of dunces found themselves in the quicksand -filled areas of the jungles in the vicinity of the Fire Mountain . Rowr found himself half-submerged in the hungry sands. The trio came up with an ingenious rescue plan. Rowr conjured a patch of web between two jungle trees, while his companions used vines and the web to try and pull the tiger katanga out of the quicksand. Budd and Crash fashioned a giant slingshot out of the magical webs and trees with Rowr attached to the middle of the makeshift device. The duo pulled the sling all the way down to the sand level with vines, about to launch their friend from the quicksand into the air, equally if not a more dangerous situation. As Budd and Crash were ready to release the slingshot, a group of Malatran heroes stumbled across the trio as they headed to slay the Mother of a Thousand Young.</p>
<p>It was unknown whether the heroes successfully stopped Budd and Crash from killing their friend attempting to rescue him, helped the trio come up with a better plan, or simply stood back and watched the show.</p>
