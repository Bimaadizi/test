<p>Tower shields , also known as body shields or large shields , were a large-sized style of shield in the Realms that were sometimes conflated with kite shields .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tower shields were big in size and heavy, reaching from the chin down to the toes of a wielder. For many races this meant an average height of around 4‒6 ft (1.2‒1.8 m), width of 2‒3 ft (0.61‒0.91 m), and weight of 15 lb (6.8 kg). They were typically made of either metal or wood. Ironwood saw usage throughout much of the Sword Coast , as the material made for very durable and lighter weight tower shields.</p>
<p>Due to the massive size relative to their users, wielding a tower shield required fastening it to one's forearm and firmly gripping it with the shield hand at all times.</p>
