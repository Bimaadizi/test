<p>The Lady's College was the first open school for mages in Silverymoon . It was considered by many to be the heart of the Conclave of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The education system of Lady's College was unique, as unlike the other schools at the time, it didn’t utilize the traditional apprentice-master dynamic, in which a master took on several apprentices, and slowly taught them magic in exchange for servitude. The Lady's College took on aspiring mages as students, not as servants. Setting itself apart from its contemporaries further, it also taught bardic lore and history.</p>
<p>The radically different teaching philosophy of Lady's College made the school a polarizing institution, [ speculation ] though even its detractors agreed that its graduates were not only talented wizards, but also well rounded scholars.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The school was established in the Year of the Firewall, 821 DR , by Elué Dualen and Lynx .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , the student system of Lady’s College became the standard in magical education throughout Silverymoon , replacing the traditional master-apprentice dynamic as the default education system.</p>
