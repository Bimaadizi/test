<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1482 DR , Avery was the proprietor of Felogyr's Fireworks. Around this time, the disguised Imbralym Skoond came to his shop, ordered a large amount of fireworks, and bought everything he had in his store. Skoond, however, did not reveal his identity, and used the alias "Horus Kope". The disguised mage also paid for the names of those who would supply Avery with his raw materials.</p>
<p>Sometime in or shortly before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Avery Sonshal was infected with an illithid tadpole of the Absolute , indoctrinating him into the servitude to the cult and making him a True Soul . Whilst serving the looming anger of the cult, Avery supplied the new Lord Enver Gortash and his cultists of Bane with smokepowder and explosives. Avery's explosives were used to arm the sunken Iron Throne headquarters to detonate in case of emergency, and the Banites were supplied the explosives to be used against the refugees that began flooding the city, fleeing the armies of the Absolute.</p>
