<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR , Raztan was in the force holding Narthil when Elmara, a priestess of Mystra who was secretly the Prince Elminster Aumar came there. After she frightened a number of armsmen with an illusion , a Magelord of Athalantar arrived. The magelord approached her at Myrkiel's Rest , an inn where she was eating, along with a number of armsmen, including Raztan, one whose name the magelord knew. He ordered Raztan to sword her; though Raztan did, she was under the effects of an ironguard spell, and all Raztan accomplished was hurling himself face-first into a bowl of soup . After she countered them by casting a spell that appeared to turn their swords to snakes, Raztan and the armsmen fled.</p>
