<p>The City Cemetery , also known as the City Graveyard or Central Cemetery , was the central public graveyard of the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR . While by that time there were many graveyards in and around the city, both public and private, this cemetery was the foremost resting place for Ravens Bluff's most important residents.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The cemetery was located some distance east of Ravens Bluff, atop a bluff overlooking the Fire River , across from Castle Iron Guard . A bridge spanning over the Fire River connected it to the opposing side of the river. The distance of the graveyard from the city proper was a deliberate choice made to minimize the threat of undead intrusions in the Ravenian streets.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A fence measuring 4 feet (1.2 meters) in height surrounded the cemetery. At its gates stood a small office where the night-shift caretaker would reside. The cemetery had a rather dark and gloomy atmosphere, punctuated by the shadows and silhouettes cast by trees and its ancient mausoleums.</p>
<h2>Law</h2>
<p>The cemetery was originally overseen by the city's Lord Regent , but the duty later turned to the Regent of City Works . Exhumation of bodies from the cemetery required permits from the office of the Regent. Any unlawful digging in the cemetery would be judged as grave robbing and punishable by 10 years imprisonment in the Golden Ball . Following the establishment of the city's temple of Kelemvor , it was expected for one to pay the clergy a service fee for exhumations.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the cemetery was originally under the care of Graham Wolfe . Whenever he was away on business, his three other caretakers would manage the property. These included Moe , who worked day shifts, and Fijar Smokewind , who worked night shifts. The duties of these caretakers included preventing graverobbing, caring for any plants or objects left on graves, keeping the cemetery clean, and locking it up at night. Following the establishment of the True Temple of the Dead, the local order of the Church of Kelemvor assumed responsibility of caring for the city's dead. The Temple of Kelemvor, or the Office of the Undertakers , could be approached with inquiries as to the location of a specific grave or tomb, as they kept records detailing who was buried in each plot.</p>
<p>Other individuals known to work at the cemetery included John Porter , a part-time gravedigger; Jerry , assistant mortician to the True Temple of the Dead; and Morry , a mortician.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Late in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , a night after the funeral service for Deputy Mayor Belanor Fenmarel , a group of adventurers defeated the Cyricist lich Tindel Miller and his undead minions, who had been eliminating Kelemvorites in an effort to improve his standing with Cyric . A minor death then appeared, judging some of them worthy of one day being specialty priests of Kelemvor, and then motioned towards a dark mausoleum. The adventurers watched as the structure warped, growing in both size and height, until finalizing into what would be the True Temple of the Dead. The temple's doors then swung open and a priest who had spoken earlier at Belanor's funeral, Damien Rethart , stepped out. He proclaimed himself to be "a priest of the people and Kelemvor's representative to all Ravenians", then implored those who could see the good in death to consider this new temple as "the rightful home for all souls ." Following this decree, two minor deaths joined Damien, one emerging from the temple walls and the other erupting straight out of the ground. Damien then announced that these two minor deaths would be permanent guardians of the temple's interior.</p>
<p>Following the establishment of this temple, Damien approached the city's Clerical Circle and declared that his order would from then on be seeing to the care of the city's dead. The assembly were uncertain what to make of Damien's words, whether to consider them a mere request or an authoritative ultimatum.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , a group of adventurers visited Damien and were informed that the necromancer Szass Tam was posing a threat to the city. When the adventurers tried to leave the cemetery, they found that dread warriors had cut down the far side of the bridge and were in the midst of cutting down the remaining pieces of their side.</p>
