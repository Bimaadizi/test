<p>Goodman Feston Bargewright was the owner and innkeeper of the Old Bargewright inn in the settlement of Bargewright Inn within the Dessarin Valley in the late 15 th century DR . He was a descendant and namesake of the settlement's founder .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As well as the inn, circa 1479 DR , Feston also oversaw access to a secret Harper portal located in a cave beneath the inn that linked to portals in Everlund , a root cellar in Noanar's Hold , and elsewhere. He aided those Harper agents who made use of it; he could be contacted through an exchange of passphrases relating coded information and flashing a Harper symbol, and would grant the key to the room with the secret passage. He would also ask the agents for news. He liked the excitement and intrigue of this duty, but knew too little about the mysterious elderly woman who guarded the portal itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Ches 21 , the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , Feston dealt with Brin when he negotiated for him and Havilar to use the Harper portal to reach Noanar's Hold.</p>
