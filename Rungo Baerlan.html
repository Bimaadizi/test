<p>In Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Rungo was one of the men at Warmfires House for the murder of Maervidal Iloster , a scrivener. After he escaped, the Zhentarim operative Calivar Murpeth interrogated the local wench Talatha, actually Storm Silverhand in spell-guise, to find him. She claimed that she'd helped Maervidal escape because he had four armed men with him, and they threatened her; when asked to point them out, she singled out Worvor Drezil , Strabbin Stillcorn , Rungo Baerlan, and Raelus Ustarren . One of them tried to fight, but Taerach Thone slew him with a dagger to the neck on the spot. He slew the second one before they could respond, and then slew the other two despite putting up a fight.</p>
