<p>Turthtraal was the duty-house and garthraun (police) station that guarded Handrornlar, the north gate that pierced the double walls surrounding Khôltar , the Iron City, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Turthtraal was the collective name of the two towers on either side of Handrornlar just inside the city walls. They were at the intersection of two of the three great thoroughfares that connected the three city gates in a huge triangle: Orntathtar Way and the North Way . Facing north out of the gate, the left-hand tower was called Drurntraal (literally, "West Traal") and the right-hand tower was called Lathacetraal ("East Traal"). (A traal was any business or building that catered to outsiders. ) Next to Drurntraal, on Orntathtar Way, was Taurgaur's Tarjteir and then Phlambror's tavern. Next to Lathacetraal, across an alley that branched off the North Way was Munsrum's Ready Ladle , Oraundro Nempeth's rope and wire shop, and Harhallo's Warmhearth House . Directly south of Turthtraal, across the wide, courtyard-like intersection, was the truncated point of the angle between the roads that featured (west to east) Harmeirlarko's Journeys , Surlpar's Stews , and Jamrado's Thanetalium .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The twin towers of Turthtraal were squat stone towers that resembled oversized turrets. They were each connected to the inner wall by an arc of battlements that funneled traffic to the gate.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Turthtraal contained garthraun offices, small vaults for holding goods and a few cells for holding prisoners, and armories.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Its main day-to-day function was as a duty-house where wagons and caravan beasts had their cargo inspected and the entry tax was collected.</p>
