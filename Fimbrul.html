<p>Fimbrul , also known as the Land of Giants , was a small nation of giants located amid the northern Howling Mountains in Laerakond . Fimbrul was known for its few landmarks and the small communities hidden in the snowy mountains.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Darrawn was the only proper Fimbran city, the rest of the settlements being small trade moots or strongholds not acknowledged by the giants. Because of that, every settlement was self-sufficient and ruled itself.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Fimbrul was composed mostly by the Howling Mountains range.</p>
<h3>Locations</h3>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the War of Fang and Talon , most of the surviving primordials of Abeir went to the Howling Mountains to hide from the wrath of their dragon steeds, and eventually entered into a coma-like sleep. Most of those primordials, such as Blazing Rorn the Fury or Cirotralech , went to hide in the mountains that eventually will become part of Fimbrul.</p>
<p>In 1469 DR , a group of oni appeared in Fimbrul and organized the usually scattered Fimbran orc tribes into formidable war bands. The oni then led them against the Fimbran giants.</p>
