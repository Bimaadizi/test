<p>Skunk shot was a type of mage shot that consisted of a large stone filled with foul-smelling liquid.</p>
<p>When this projectile was shot from a siege weapon, the stone would shatter and release its contents. When the fluid was exposed to air, such as within a spelljammer 's air envelope, it would rapidly evaporate into a toxic green cloud, as per the spell stinking cloud . This vapor affected anyone within its radius in a similar manner to the spell.</p>
