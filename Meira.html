<p>Meira the Dark was a priestess of Shar near Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was simultaneously gaunt and "toadlike", yet wrinkled, but with glossy raven hair, and glittering green eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>With a penchant for grim humor and quick wit, Meira was nonetheless marked by the scorn she had for all good folk, her cannibalism, and her hatred of the word "why".</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She wielded magic that changed the looks of another both temporarily and for good, as well as spells that destroyed magic devices .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The woman lived in a filthy cave near Neverwinter , but still had a few enchanted possessions at hand, including a magic-dead ring .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was part of a nameless cabal that worked intrigues all over Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Auvrarn Labraster sought succor after escaping Silverymoon by using a teleport ring , he sent himself to the abode of Meira the Dark. There, she aided him, working spells to destroy his magic items, preventing him being tracked through them, then burning his clothes, and finally reshaping him into the likeness of Azoun IV . She then spent the night with him, reshaping herself into some other wench, unlike her own deliberately disgusting shape.</p>
<p>In the morning, she reshaped him instead into the likeness of Blandras Nuin , a man she'd recently sacrificed in some dark rite, who owned a home in nearby Neverwinter, and gave him a magic-dead ring that thwarted just about all magic.</p>
