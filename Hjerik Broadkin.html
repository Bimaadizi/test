<p>Hjerik Broadkin was an inhabitant of Vanesci Hamlet in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Hjerik was an upstart bloodforge mage. When the leader of the Legendary Campaign passed through the streets of Vanesci, Hjerik provoked them and publically challenged them to a bloodforge duel—it was common for such upstarts to challenge renowned bloodforge mages. Unable to ignore the challenge, they waged a bloodforge battle in and around Vanesci Hamlet.</p>
