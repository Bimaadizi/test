<p>The Elfstone Tavern was a tavern in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep , on the Street of the Sword . It catered to elves and half-elves in the city, and was run by Yaereene Ilbaereth circa the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The main taproom was thirty feet high with living trees in it. A large oak tree grew in each corner, and upper-story rooms provided privacy and sleeping quarters. Skylights were present in the ceiling, along with shutters that could be opened to allow rain and light in during the day for the trees.</p>
<p>There was a small sitting room situated at the back of the building, which was used by the staff for Reverie . It contained furniture such as lounging chairs, chaises, and divans, arranged around a low table, and was magically protected against eavesdropping.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The tavern was dimly lit and smelled earthy. Its walls were covered with torches and it also had chandeliers that glowed with a silver-white flame when lit. Light could also be provided by dancing lights spells, for a soft, blue shade.</p>
<p>Entertainment was provided in the form of choral, flute , harp , or pipe music. Service was always fast, near-silent, and graceful. Although the owner and staff are all moon elves and welcomed everyone, some elven patrons were less hospitable. Humans , half-elves and halflings were tolerated, but dwarves and half-orcs were turned away. Volo expressed that if not for the intolerant behavior of some elven patrons he would have rated this place five full tankards.</p>
<h2>Food and drink</h2>
<p>The Elfstone served elven delicacies such as elverquisst , guldathen nectar and maerlathen blue wine , and also Evereskan clearwater , moonwine , biscuits with crab meat, mint jelly, roe , shrimp or spiced silverfin , and skewers of rabbit , squirrel or venison with a green sauce.</p>
