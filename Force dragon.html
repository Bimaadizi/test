<p>Force dragons were extremely powerful, arrogant, and aloof dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Newly hatched force dragons had translucent scales that resembled shimmering diamonds . As they aged, their innate manipulation of force made them harder and harder to see, until, at the peak of their power, they became completely invisible. Their hide became nearly as hard as a wall of force .</p>
<p>Force dragons were completely odorless.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In general, force dragons were reclusive and did not have any interest in talking to other races, judging all of them inferior to their own in knowledge and intellect. Because of this, they had no desire for conversation. The only other races respected by force dragons were prismatic dragons and some deities .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>It was rare for force dragons to provoke a fight, but they defended their territories with relentless fury until every trespasser was killed or driven away. Their natural ability to manipulate force made it easy for them to deflect incoming attacks, so they were extremely hard to hit, with their natural scales nearly impenetrable.</p>
<p>Force dragons' general combat strategy was to attack with their breath weapons, while separating opponents and confining dangerous foes with their magical abilities.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Force dragons resided in remote regions far away from civilization, but otherwise had no marked preference for terrain or climate. Their potential lairs were ancient forests, forbidding mountains, vast deserts, and very large and wide subterranean chasms.</p>
<p>They could be found in the Dragon Eyrie .</p>
<p>Despite their size, force dragons ate very little and alternated eating with long periods of sleep. They were open-minded to any meat, but sages speculated that force dragons fed on force effects or even raw magical power.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their breath weapon consisted of a devastating cone of force.</p>
<p>As a wyrmling , force dragons possessed an innate shield of force that guarded against attacks. Later, a juvenile force dragon's shield of force distorted light around it like a continuous blur spell and as an old dragon, their shield of force bent light so much as to become like a displacement spell. A great wyrm force dragon was a creature of pure force that attained greater invisibility .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>The horns of a force dragon of at least adult age could be used to provide the magical energy for a staff of power .</p>
