<p>Ondil of the Many Spells was a lich from Thaeravel in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ondil was all but bones by that time.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ondil had hanging spells he could trigger at will, including one that pulled all the bones out of the target's flesh, in a manner similar to call bones , and one that instantly reduced someone to ash and bones with flame. He had also enspelled his windows with a spell that squeezed a target through them.</p>
<p>Presumably, he was also responsible for the magical trappings of Ondil's Tower .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Beyond his own personal possessions, he was the owner still of Ondil's Tower. He also kept a number of griffons in livery, which roamed his valley for some time. Notably, he possessed Ondil's Book of Spells , and kept three spellbooks on his tomb.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ondil was largely confined to his grave by the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Other mages such as Undarl Dragonrider and Ilhundyl craved an opportunity to plunder his magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the expansion of Netheril , Ondil fled Rasilith for a valley along the Horn Hills in Athalantar , where he raised his tower, known as Ondil's Tower.</p>
<p>In the 232 DR , the Mystran priestess Elmara (actually a disguise of Prince Elminster Aumar ), was sent to seize Ondil's Book of Spells by Ilhundyl. To this end, she joined the Brave Blades , a party of adventurers, in their foray into his tower.</p>
<p>After being confronted at his tomb by the Brave Blades, he slew them with hanging spells at the threshold of its entrance until Othbar used a spell that incapacitated him temporarily. Afterwards, Elmara employed spells to drop ceiling bricks on his sarcophagus to deal damage, until she was able to stomp on all his bones one by one.</p>
<p>Undarl Dragonrider, one of the Magelords of Athalantar , teleported into his tomb after his destruction, killed the leader of the Brave Blades, and explosively hurled Elmara out the window, stating his intent to seize Ondil's magic. Unknown to him, Elmara had taken and hidden away Ondil's Book of Spells .</p>
