<p>Anthara "Softangles" Shalymarr was a Mulhorandi woman living in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr . She was a former thief and later a tavernkeeper and proprietress of the Scarlet Sheath tavern.</p>
<h2>Description & Personality</h2>
<p>Anthara was tall and sinuous of build, with dark eyes. She was also hot-tempered, and often hurled a dagger into too-lusty patrons.</p>
<p>She operated it under three firmly held principles: that a tavern should provide comfortable furniture and swift service; that tapestries could conceal holes or burn marks in the walls; and that it should be separate from daily matters, where people could talk freely. Anthara had an agreement with Lord Sarp Redbeard , ruler of Wheloon, that no one could be held accountable for things said in the Scarlet Sheath.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Anthara was once a thief in Mulhorand, but retired and later came to Wheloon in Cormyr. There, she took over an abandoned, ruined building, turning it into the Scarlet Sheath tavern by 1358 DR . She still ran it by 1369 DR .</p>
