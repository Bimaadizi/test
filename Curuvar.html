<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The eccentric wizard was suspicious of newcomers to the town, but was a valuable ally when his trust was earned. While we was not much of a talker—especially around those he did not trust—Curuvar was fond of stating the phrase, "by Mystra's lost spell".</p>
<p>He was knowledgeable about history, and was one of the few people who knew the truth about the Ogre King who had terrorized the region in the early 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As of 1479 DR, Curuvar was seeking knowledge on the dreaded Dire Wood and on Draigdurroch Tower .</p>
<p>He frequented the Green Tankard tavern in Loudwater.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Curuvar infiltrated the Barrow of the Ogre King and stole the horn totem from the resident goblins , prompting them to launch a raid on Loudwater to retrieve the item. In response, Curuvar proceeded to seek adventurers to go and steal the goblins' other treasure, the skull totem . While his motives were unclear, it could have been that he sought to disrupt a goblin ritual that aimed to revive the Ogre King.</p>
