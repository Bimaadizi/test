<p>The Weeping Unicorn was an inn and tavern in the city of Calaunt in the Vast , operating around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>It was a quiet and comfortable place located by the docks, and of good quality for moderate prices. It was oft-used to do business by villainous sorts.</p>
<p>The house rule was strictly "no fighting", which all patrons obeyed, as those who didn't tended to run into a cockatrice . Their petrified forms adorned the cellar.</p>
