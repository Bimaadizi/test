<p>Feldrin Bloodfeathers was the founder and first king of the realm of Damara . He lived during the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>Feldrin hailed from Ravensburg , the first settlement in what would become the lands of the Damaran Duchy of Carmathan . He was a nobleman of Sembian heritage.</p>
<p>He was credited with founding the city of Heliogabalus in the Year of the Bronze Banner, 1075 DR , and establishing it as the seat of his new Kingdom of Damara. He and his associates likewise founded the city of Trailsend , which would become the capital of the Barony of Polten .</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>Feldrin's lineage was much loved by the people of Damara, and his line ruled unbroken for nearly three hundred years. The last member of House Bloodfeathers died in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , when Virdin Bloodfeathers fell in battle with Zhengyi the Witch-King , who then claimed the Damaran throne. By the time of the Witch-King's ouster two years later, only three direct descendants of Feldrin remained: Dimian Ree , the Baron of Morov ; Tranth , the former Baron of Bloodstone ; and Christine Dragonsbane , daughter of Tranth and wife to the then-Baron of Bloodstone, Gareth Dragonsbane .</p>
