<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Thalon and his throne were the subject of a famous rhyme, said to predate Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357Â DR , Laeral Rythkyn discovered what was to her knowledge the oldest extant copy of the rhyme. Written in Thorass , it was encrypted with a spell. She found it in an old spellbook which she had unearthed in some cellars in Everlund while helping the Harpers eliminate wraiths there. By mid- Kythorn of that year, she deciphered the encrypted message, discovering that the location of Thalon's Throne was in a tower hidden near Alander , the Lost Peaks .</p>
<p>She explored the tower and braved its many perils, only to discover her apprentice Blaskyn followed her to lay an ambush at the end. He then sat on the throne, and was soon subsumed by Thalon's consciousness. She prevailed over Thalon afterwards, and resolved to decomission his throne sooner than later.</p>
