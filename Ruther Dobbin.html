<h2>History</h2>
<p>Earl Dobbin's family had ruled Stagwick for at least 36 generations. His home was Dobbin Manor .</p>
<p>Earl Dobbin was one of Princess Brianna's suitors and thought by many to be her most favorable choice, though she ultimately chose the firbolg ranger Tavis Burdun out of love. Ruther Dobbin was attending a fire giant dance at the Weary Giant on the same day that Princess Brianna was captured. Also, at that time, the verbeeg runecaster Basil of Lyndusfarne had stolen a book from Dobbin that had been written by his relative, titled A Full History of the Dobbins of Stagwick .</p>
