<p>Aran Linvail was an assassin in Athkatla in Amn in the late 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Abdel Adrian needed a large sum of money in order to go after two of his friends, and Bodhi passed him the offer to gain the sum by killing Linvail. Abdel hesitated at first, having decided never to kill for money again, but as he very much needed the money, he decided that killing an assassin might be a form of justice. He infiltrated Linvail's house, waited in his closet for him to be finished with a lover, and finally killed him after a protracted, awkward fight. Who wanted Linvail dead and why, or if there even was a genuine outstanding price on his head, is unknown. The only source of information on this was Bodhi, who had her own agenda. [ speculation ]</p>
