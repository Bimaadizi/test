<p>Snow cloakers were a type of cloaker adapted to survive and thrive in the cold and snowy reaches of the High Ice .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snow cloakers looked and acted much like ordinary cloakers with the notable exception of their snowy white coloration (rather than black), which made them well-adapted to blending into wintry environments. Their sinewy, cloak -like bodies seemed to be utterly immune to cold weather, and allowed them to fly silently even through windy conditions.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Like regular cloakers, snow cloakers possessed an alien thought process that made them very difficult for other creatures to understand. They were fiendish and territorial.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Like regular cloakers, snow cloakers were solitary carnivores, but unlike their subterranean cousins, they dwelt on or near the surface and made their lairs in icy rifts and crevasses. They were patient hunters who relied on camouflage and stealth to get near their prey, gliding above them and then dropping down to devour them.</p>
<h3>Homeland</h3>
<p>Snow cloakers were exceedingly rare, and were said to be found exclusively in and around Llashloch , the "Lake of Ice", a glacial lake located inside a rift on the High Ice. This lake never fully froze over, making it a suitable home for aquatic creatures, which in turn made it alluring to travelers and predators. These visitors to the Lake were the snow cloakers' primary prey.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 14 th century DR , the population of snow cloakers at Llashloch was small and dwindling. At that time, Elminster opined that the species might be headed to extinction.</p>
