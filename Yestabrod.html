<p>Yestabrod was a mutant myconid leader of the Circle of Masters in Neverlight Grove in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Neverlight Grove circa 1486 DR , Yestabrod was created as the leader of the new Circle of Masters, which was formed by Phylo only from myconids corrupted by Zuggtmoy . It was so corrupted by the demon lord that it looked more like an aberration than a myconid. It acted as a priest of Zuggtmoy in the wedding preparation ceremony between the demon lord and Araumycos , but was defeated before the ritual was completed by an adventuring party that had escaped the drow of Velkynvelve .</p>
