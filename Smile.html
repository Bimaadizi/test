<h2>History</h2>
<p>Smile was the sister of Smote , a rogue and wizard of similar bent.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, Smile and her partner, Londal Fen , were employed by Lady Arthas of the Temple of Mystra . Smile persuaded Smote to attend the temple and participate in the rite of Mystra's Sacred Trust there. This ended in Smote being dominated by the Starry Gnosis and abducted as part of a secret Sharran plot. Smote later wasn't sure if he should take revenge on his sister for this or not.</p>
<p>If adventurers investigating the strange behavior of the clerics of Mystra there attacked the temple, then she would pay the pair 830 gp to ambush them. Smile and Londal would lure the adventurers into an ambush among the waterfront warehouses at 23 Impil Street , or otherwise keep tabs on them to ambush and murder them out of sight. She would even set a net trap against them, but would flee if the fight went against her.</p>
