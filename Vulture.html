<p>Vultures were a common species of bird.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vultures were large birds with filthy feathers. Their main distinguishing feature was their featherless pink head.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Vultures were considered to be cowardly animals. Upon sighting anything on the ground that appeared injured or dead, a vulture would quickly swoop down to investigate.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Vultures had an acute, long distance vision. Their keen eyesight is comparable to that of any eagle , falcon , or hawk . Being carrion eaters, they developed the ability to consume infected, poisoned or rotting meat safely.</p>
<p>A female vulture could lay up to four eggs at a time. These eggs were incubated over a period of two months until they hatched. A young vulture could fly at four months of age.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vultures were scavengers, attacking prey only once it has died or collapsed from exhaustion. Vultures only attacked moving prey if in a group, and only if the prey was already near collapsing.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Vultures typically lived in flocks.</p>
<h3>Diets</h3>
<p>These creatures were carrion eaters. They fed upon creatures that were either injured or already dead. Though they were also liable to attack creatures that were unconscious, restrained, or sleeping.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Vultures typically inhabited high altitudes, such as mountains, within temperate or tropical regions. They were usually encountered in warm areas, floating on updrafts over open spaces.</p>
<p>In the Hordelands they could be found in the Katakoro Plateau , the Raurin and Quoya Deserts , and among its many mountain ranges.</p>
<p>In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea , they could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , vultures could be found in the plane of Acheron .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Vultures were a symbol and favored animal of Thasmudyan , the god of undeath in the Zakharan pantheon . Evil swanmays sometimes shapechanged into the form of a vulture.</p>
<p>Bedine believed that vultures served N'asr. They spied on his behalf and ferried spirits to the Camp of the Dead. Even non-Bedine could experience a brief connection to the Fugue Plane when staring into the eyes of a vulture.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>The bones and feathers of a vulture were used as material components in the casting of some spells .</p>
