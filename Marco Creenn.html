<p>Marco Creenn was an alias used by a planeswalker whose name was also misremembered as "Tuqueen" â€“ a reluctant client of the Sharran House of Grief in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Marco was a pale and human -looking man with black disheveled head of hair. He also had a noticeably exotic accent for a Baldurian's ear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , an unknown planeswalker appeared out of thin air, falling atop of Lenore De Hurst as she was getting ready to weave magics with her fellow Mystrans . In her later report to Lorroakan of Sorcerous Sundries , Lenore state that the magic wielded by the man was indescribable, strange, alien, not of the Weave . As he landed on Toril , the planeswalker created a planar anomaly that for a time, spirited Lenore away, trapped her between hers and some mysterious other world. From the incident, she only remembered T and Q in the man's name, possibly recalling is at "Tuqueen."</p>
<p>Soon after, the planeswalker took an alias of Marco Creenn and sought out the services of the House of Grief. The Mapping of the Heart revealed Elvere's "prying heart" but he disappeared before the Unburdening ritual was to take place. Marco paid for the ritual in full using alien coinage , but, as he fled, there was no refund. The strange man attracted the attention of Mother Superior of Shar , Viconia De Vir . She issued an order to track "Marco Creenn" down as during the Mapping , she detected thoughts of a strange world and stranger people, as well as thoughts fixated on a powerful artifact , a sword , or possibly a "zord," whatever it may be.</p>
