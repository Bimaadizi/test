<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the lead-up to the Council of the Dragon in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Khaladan Mallowfaer sent two handies, Darlakan and Emmur , to Zorsin's Dock, where they would unpack some furniture needed for the council. He later sent Halance Tarandar to go after them, to make sure they didn't break any. Halance, however, was slain on the way to the dock.</p>
