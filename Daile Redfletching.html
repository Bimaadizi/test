<p>Ren carved for Daile a longbow and polished the wood with the ioun stones from the hilts of his magical daggers Left and Right . The longbow was imbued with the magical power to shoot arrows with great accuracy and distance. The bow had a deep red-brownish color and a highly polished surface, and emitted a low hum when Daile wielded it and only she could use it. The ioun stones magically embedded themselves within Daile's bow when Left and Right were passed on to her after Ren's death.</p>
