<p>Silverywing was a young silver dragon . She lived in the Dawn Age and served the legendary gold elf Prince Durothil . She died at age 20, in combat with the red dragon Mahatnartorian .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Birth and early years</h3>
<p>Durothil received Silverywing's dragon-egg from the ancient red great wyrm Mahatnartorian, who killed her mother and gave the egg to the prince. They both had made a bargain: the prince got the egg and, twenty years later, the dragon, in exchange for a special moon elf as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Durothil kept Silverywing confined within his magical dimension. Silverywing grew to develop a love for learning and beauty. She and Durothil created attacks and spells together.</p>
<h3>Freedom and death</h3>
<p>After 20 years of confinement, Durothil planned to let Silverywing go free, and sent Sharlario Moonflower to the top of a mountain in preparation. Mahatnartorian appeared and attacked Sharlario. Silverywing emerged from the magical dimension, ridden by Durothil, and attacked Mahatnartorian, but she was not powerful enough to defeat the great wyrm. The fight was over quickly and resulted in the deaths of Silverywing, Mahatnartorian, and Durothil himself.</p>
