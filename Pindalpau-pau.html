<p>Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother was a totem spirit worshiped by the Ice Hunters .</p>
<p>It was forbidden for those Ice Hunter shamans who worshiped her to eat reindeer meat or fat, wear anything made from reindeer, or otherwise harm a reindeer. However, those shamans that worshiped her could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day, summon reindeer to their aid twice a tenday, and eventually even shapechange into a reindeer twice each tenday.</p>
<p>Additionally, iceguardians who revered the Reindeer Mother alongside Ulutiu also could call upon the horns of wisdom or reindeer hooves once each day.</p>
