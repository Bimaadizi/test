<p>Tusgront was a member of The Guild from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tusgront was a half-orcish sentry and muscle. He was a tall, muscled, imposing figure dressed in barbarian garb dyed emerald green – the color of The Guild, and armed with a greataxe . He had curly chestnut hair gathered in a bun. Tusgront wore a signet ring of The Guild that unlocked the secret passage into the Guildhall.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Tusgront was tasked with standing guard of the secret entrance into Baldur's Gate's Undercellar where The Guild's Guildhall was hidden. Tusgront appeared intimidating but preferred not to engage in violence when threatened. He harbored disdain for the agents of the Zhentarim who were allied with Nine-Fingers Keene at the time. Tusgront still stood guard, surrounded by a small number of fellow Guildsmen, ready to make holes in any adventurers or journalists trying to sneak in without the Guildmaster's approval.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Tusgront was one of the Guild's muscle named and detailed in a book penned by the Flaming Fists , that compiled the mercenaries' investigation and research into Nine-Fingers Keene – Queen of Kingpins . Tusgront was described as being nothing but dim brute by the Fists.</p>
