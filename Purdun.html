<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Purdun was one of King Korox Morkann 's best friends, and Purdun was married to the king's younger sister, Dijara . The noble couple were among the king's strongest supporters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the reign of Duke Valon Morkann , Purdun's father-in-law, the so-called Duke of Dusk from the neighboring duchy of Tethyr plotted with several counts and barons of Elestam to overthrow and assassinate Duke Morkann. The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, led by the duke's son, Korox, and his friends, including Purdon and several others. The adventuring party successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.</p>
<p>After the Ten Black Days of Eleint , the Crusaders continued to protect the new monarchy of Erlkazar for many years. When King Valon Morkann died in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , Korox was made king in his father's stead, and Korox quickly appointed Purdun and his other companions from the Crusaders as barons over the lands of Erlkazar. Purdun "the Firefist" was made into the ruler of Ahlarkhem.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Purdun was joined by Liam and Ryder in defending Zerith Hold from the vampiress Shyressa of the Twisted Rune .</p>
