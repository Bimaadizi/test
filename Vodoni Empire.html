<p>The Vodoni Empire was a vast and aggressive realm in the phlogiston . Spanning twelve crystal spheres , it was the largest and mightiest empire in the region of the Prime Material plane known to the inhabitants of Realmspace . In the mid‒14 th century DR , an attempted vodoni invasion of Realmspace, Greyspace , and Krynnspace triggered the conflict that became known as the War of the Spheres .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The empire counted with a vast fleet of spelljammers and an army of lycanthropic soldiers that numbered in the tens of millions. The ships of the line of the vodoni fleet included the hunter-killer , the nightwolf , and the werewolf , which were all built by the zalani in one of the crystal spheres controlled by the Empire. Vulkaran's personal warship was a unique vodoni diamond .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Formation</h3>
<p>The vodoni expansion started sometime in the 10 th century DR , when Vodon Prime , the star of Vodonispace , exploded in a supernova. The disaster caused unimaginable destruction throughout the system, completely destroying the fourth planet Kathyk and opening a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire on the first planet Sala . The entire population of the sphere had to flee to the neighboring sphere of Vodonikaspace in a massive exodus led by emperor Vulkaran .</p>
<p>The deities of the Vodoni pantheon , led by the Crystal King , also needed to flee the sphere from the impending disaster, but were incapable of doing so while keeping their own power. The pantheon designed a way to escape by entering the artifact known as the Eye of the Gods , built by the Crystal King himself, and trusting a mortal to release the deities at an opportune time. However, Vulkaran tricked the deities into trusting him with the key of their release, as part of his plan to keep them trapped for eternity while he consolidated his own power.</p>
<p>After completely colonizing Vodonikaspace, the vodoni set out to recover their lost technological knowledge by conquering and annexing neighboring crystal spheres. This expansion campaign slowly rendered the vodoni more aggressive and warlike, as sphere after sphere came firmly under the control of Vulkaran and his army of werewolves .</p>
<h3>The War of the Spheres</h3>
<p>In the mid–14 th century DR, Vulkaran set his eyes on three spheres that neighbored the Empire: Greyspace, Krynnspace, and Realmspace. Only vaguely aware of space travel at the time, the spheres seemed like an easy conquest for the Empire. As a prelude to invasion, vodoni spelljammers conducted minor raids throughout the spheres with relative impunity, until an incident with a group of adventurers in Realmspace brought matters to the attention of the Elven Imperial Fleet , as the Arrow of Justice escorted the adventurers to the Rock of Bral for the first war council of the Free Space Alliance .</p>
<p>After a reconnaissance mission into Vodonispace, the council decided that, in order to prevent the impending vodoni invasion, a fleet composed of nearly all spacefaring races of the alliance set out to strike Vodonispace, with the adventurers assigned to spearhead the invasion and defeat Vulkaran himself in his palace in the Imperial City on Vulkarus . Vulkaran's defeat marked the dissolution of the Empire, freeing the imprisoned pantheon and restoring freedom to the twelve spheres.</p>
<p>The Vodoni Empire was completely dissolved after the war. Although most vodoni enforcer troops were destroyed, it was rumored that some soldiers had survived, in a similar fashion to the humanoids who had survived the First Unhuman War .</p>
