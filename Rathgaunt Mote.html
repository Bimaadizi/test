<p>Rathguant Mote was an earthmote in the Underchasm in south Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Prior to the Spellplague in 1385 DR , Rathguant Mote was part of the Rathgaunt Hills and a gnomish abbey known as the Shield of the Rathgaunt Hills sat on the site. When the Spellplague created the Underchasm, the area surrounding the abbey broke off into a large earthmote. As of 1479 DR the mote was inhabited by only the former gnomish monks who continued to exist as undead creatures.</p>
