<p>Krinos Pandipolous was the manager of the baths in the city of Phoenix in Raurin during its last years. He was the most evil man in the city, and became a wraith upon death.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Krinos was so evil that all of the priests in the city cursed him, chained him to the benches in the changing room, and left him to die when they abandoned the city. After his death, he became a wraith that haunted the ruins of the city, gathering as his minions the skeletons of adventurers who died within. He worked as a team together with those undead.</p>
