<p>Ulth was an adventurer in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>His adventuring band numbered eight at least.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ulth had been with one comrade, searching Storm Silverhand 's farm in the Dalelands in 1479 DR , looking for Elminster Aumar . They had found nothing; his comrade was overheard later in a group of eight people by Storm Silverhand herself; it is possible Ulth was part of that group of eight at the time. Storm had just shackled her sister, the Simbul , in a cave to prevent her from lashing out in her insanity again. Knowing her sister was defenseless and they planned on searching every cave they found, Storm took out those adventurers. These eight were felled, likely killed, whether Ulth was with them or not, as she was able to prepare some makeshift fake wands without them moving, and they received no further acknowledgement from the Highknights that later talked to Storm, whose intention had been to stop them from searching caves in the first place.</p>
