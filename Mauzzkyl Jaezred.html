<p>Mauzzkyl Jaezred was a drow-dragon ( draa'zekyl ) and the patron grandfather of the Jaezred Chaulssin as well as its founder.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mauzzkyl preferred to use his drow form, appearing as hale old man with broad shoulders, a wide chest, and thinning hair forming a widow's peak.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Mauzzkyl at his core was a rebel, who couldnâ€™t tolerate any person, organization, or even deity who would claim power over him. This part of his personality showed in his hatred for his shadow dragon ancestors, who enslaved him and his people until 634 DR , and in his hatred towards Lolth , and also his refusal to turn the Jaezred Chaulssin into a private army of assassins of the church of Vhaeraun . He saw House Jaezred as a living extension of his will and was totally devoted to the Jaezred's ideals.</p>
<p>As a leader of the Jaezred Chaulssin, he nevertheless gave reverence to Vhaeraun . While he did refer to the deity as his master and also seemed to put some value in Vhaeraun's favor, he was not completely devoted to the god.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was born in the Year of Shadowed Blades, 27 DR .</p>
<p>Mauzzkyl was the driving force behind the Jaezred's assaults on drow cities during the Silence of Lolth . He supported Nimor Imphraezl 's plan and also defended him in front of the other Patron Fathers, who criticized his plan for being too risky to succeed. He was also very pleased with the success of Zammzt Everharn on Ched Nasad , valuing the importance of breaking the church of Lolth 's power higher than the semi-total destruction of that city.</p>
<p>At the end of the Silence, he was unhappy with Nimor's failure in Menzoberranzan and agreed with his demotion from the position of anointed blade.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mauzzkyl was a fully developed drow-dragon and thus had all abilities of a great wyrm shadow dragon . Like the other drow-dragons, he did train himself in additional skills instead of fully relying on his inborn powers, in his case in the skills of both assassin and sorcerer .</p>
