<p>Brother Perdiem was the head priest of an Ilmatari monastery in the Dessarin Valley outside of Illefarn in the 13 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1281 DR , a being disguised as an Ilmatari cleric named Poquelin came to Perdiem's monastery, who in reality was the devil Belhifet in disguise. The man claimed that they came to teach them of the true faith of Ilmater and drew forth followers from Perdiem, warping their minds with his frighteningly passionate sermons. Though among the Ilmatari, Perdiem wasn't so easily swayed by the imposter cleric.</p>
<p>Eventually Perdiem and the other Ilmatari priests were led by Poquelin away from the monastery, abandoning their dozens of sick and dying worshipers. They traveled north into Icewind Dale , through Kuldahar Pass , losing many of their fellow clergymen along the way. Eventually they came into the ruins of the dwarven fortress Dorn's Deep . Once there Poquelin went on to declare Perdiem as one of six "lieutenants" in his organization and gifted them a badge, bearing the symbol of a dove , as a token of his authority.</p>
<p>In the Lower Depths of these ruins Perdiem and four others were instructed to guard the magical idol inside what had once been a temple to the dwarven god Berronar Truesilver . While guarding the idol he and the other Ilmatari were individually surrounded by a magical barrier. Overtime they watched as Poquelin became more militant and fascist, but the magic of the idol had them too enthralled to resist and made them believe his words superseded the gospel of Ilmatar. Those outside the idol's range tried to resist him and for their efforts were transformed into undead guardians for the idol, such as boneguards , mummies , and zombies . Even then Perdiem did not fight back against Poquelin, convinced by the mental manipulation that those clergymen were "spiritually lacking."</p>
<p>Eventually, a group of adventurers arrived to Dorn's Deep that year. Perdiem greeted them, asking if they sought "ecstasy at the hands of Ilmater's servants." He then proceeded to argue with them about the definition and nature of suffering, his understanding of it having been warped by Poquelin's influence. As the adventurers pressed onward despite his warnings, Perdiem and the undead guardians around him attacked.</p>
<p>The adventurers managed to destroyed the idol, thus freeing Perdiem and the rest of his fellow Ilmatari from its dominating effect. Once freed Perdiem thanked the adventurers for saving their souls, explained what had happened to them, and handed them his lieutenant badge so that they could confront Poquelin themselves. Perdiem expressed to the adventurers great remorse for trying to harm them, for the suffering they caused. They also expressed remorse not only for having committed great blasphemy against Ilmater , but for desecrating the ancient temple of Berronar, referring to them as "a proud mother goddess of the dwarves." And implied that he would have to endure much suffering in order to atone for what he had done.</p>
