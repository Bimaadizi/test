<p>Suka was a gnome adventurer and sailor active in the Moonshae Isles as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was small, even for a gnome, and bore several piercings (including a rings in her left nostril and along the ridge of her left ear) and tattoos (including a blue flame across her right forearm). Most notably, she had a tattoo of a purple dog on her tongue with a silver bone-shaped piercing in its mouth, and she made a point to display this tattoo to those she disliked. These piercings and tattoos were meant in part as distinguishing marks, including for if her corpse ever needed to be identified. She dyed her hair an unnatural shade of pink and wore it in clumps.</p>
<p>She wore leather armor and favored a crossbow . She kept a large number of knives concealed on her person.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was inquisitive and devious. She was quick to lose patience, resorting to mental logic and mathematics puzzles to entertain herself. She was also quite crass, sarcastic, and cynical, having a knee-jerk distaste of any authority figures, including the gods . She could also be merciless to her enemies, which she rationalized as pragmatism.</p>
<p>She was not very good at meeting new people, nor did she have any patience for small talk or for pointless negotiation. She was more comfortable with misdirecting conversations, else she was prone to tune out what was being said. In battle, she put this same aptitude for misdirection to work in order to confound and slow her enemies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was a member of the crew of the Sphinx , and was very fond and highly trusting of her captain, Lukas , despite thinking him to be more than a bit chuckleheaded. She did not care much for Gaspar-shen , whom she considered an oddity, and she saw the Savage as too self-absorbed with his secrets. She did not trust Marikke and felt that she and Kip were more tagalongs than members of the crew.</p>
<p>Suka was more comfortable around men than women and she was more at ease around humans than elves or other fey , whom she saw as arrogant, lazy, and disconnected from reality. Having fled from the isolationist land of Sarifal , she was considered a traitor by the ruling fey of her homeland. If asked why she chose to leave, she simply said that she wanted a change, and she regarded Sarifal to be encircled by a web of lies crafted by its rulers.</p>
<p>Because of shared tribulations, she had become a close friend of Marabaldia , a fomorian princess from the Underdark beneath the Winterglen forest.</p>
<p>She had ended her relationship with her father on bad terms. She never knew her mother.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was born in Sarifal on the island of Gwynneth , in the Highlands above Myrloch Vale . Her father was a former slave of a fomorian lord in the Feydark prior to the return of Karador to the Material Plane in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , and he had earned his freedom owing to his talent for song. Growing up, Suka learned many songs composed by her father, including the grossly sad ballad Oh, Father Dear , which he had intended as satirically melancholy. However, her father was an alcoholic and a scoundrel who had made a mess of his life, and Suka abandoned him after the death of her brother. Feeling oppressed by the ruling le Shay of Sarifal, she fled to the human-inhabited island of Alaron . While in Llewellyn , she first laid eyes on the Sphinx as it sailed past the harbor , and immediately felt a pull to join its crew.</p>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, the Sphinx accepted a job to escort Lord Aldon Kendrick to the ruins of Caer Corwell in Sarifal to meet with a human rebel group, the Winterglen Claw , the party was greeted by High Lady Ordalf , the ruler of Sarifal, who killed Aldon and expressed her deep distaste for "traitors" like Suka. She kept Suka as a captive while she tasked the rest of her crew to kill Lady Amaranth , Ordalf's missing half-sister who had come to lead a group of lycanthropes on the island of Moray . Suka was to be kept alive and well-fed, but the crew only had 15 days to complete their mission before Ordalf threatened to feed Suka to a fomorian imprisoned next to her. Suka would instead befriend this fomorian, a princess named Marabaldia, as well as another prisoner and lycanthrope follower of Amaranth, Poke , who both found comfort in Suka's rendition of her father's song, Oh, Father Dear . Together, they escaped the prison after Suka disabled the mechanism keeping Marabaldia's magical "evil eye" covered, which allowed them to bewitch their wardens. During their escape, Suka would have her self-confidence challenged by the mind-controlling magic of the le Shay Araithe and her morals challenged by Marabaldia and Poke, who refused to kill Araithe once they had rendered him helpless despite Suka's insistence.</p>
<p>Following their escape, the trio were rescued from a drow attack by Captain Rurik of the Winterglen Claw and Lord Mindarion of the Knights of Synnoria , although Poke would ultimately succumb to injuries sustained against the drow. They took Suka and Marabaldia to their hideout in Harrowfast , where they attempted to negotiate an alliance between Rurik's humans, Mindarion's Llewyrr elves, and Marabaldia's fomorians, led by Marabaldia's long-lost lover, Prince Ughoth . Ever the cynic, Suka had no faith that such an alliance would succeed, especially since she believed the elves to be the worst possible diplomats.</p>
<p>Suka had developed a friendly rapport with Captain Rurik given that she was much more comfortable interacting with humans than with other fey. After negotiations began to break down and Rurik's dream of ridding Gwynneth of the le Shay became more remote, she went to speak with him on an exterior lookout point above the valley of Synnoria . When a wyvern attacked out of nowhere, the pair were forced to flee down the mountainside and into Synnoria, a trespass that amounted to a defilement of the land and a grave crime in the eyes of the Llewyrr. They were accosted by three guards, including the Marchlord Oemeril Talosâ€“claere , who assumed them to be free-roaming slaves and moved to brand and imprison them. Following Rurik's lead, Suka helped to kill the elves, an act which she suddenly felt was unnecessary and regrettable. After Rurik fled from Harrowfast, the Knights of Synnoria attempted to arrest Suka, which resulted in battle between the elves and fomorians when Marabaldia chose to defend her small friend. This fighting resulted in the death of Ughoth, leaving Suka to feel personally responsible for causing Marabaldia such a loss.</p>
<p>They escaped Harrowfast into the Underdark and followed a fomorian-dug tunnel, along which they eventually encountered Lukas and Gaspar-shen, the only other two survivors of the Sphinx . The three of them would ultimately escape Gwynneth by boat.</p>
