<p>Great helm was a term used to refer to large helmets that covered the entirety of the wearer's head and neck, as well as often their upper shoulders. They were typically found in combination with plate mail or heavier armors, but rarely anything lighter than banded mail .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A great helm typically impaired its wearer's sense of hearing and vision, as their only gaps were narrow slits for the eyes to see through and small holes for breathing. Their visors were generally not removable. They were often paired with a gorget in order to offset the weight they put upon the wearer and knights often paired them with a mail coif .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This style of helmet could be found in Faerûn as far back as the Netherese Empire , where it first became available in 2975 NY (−884 DR) .</p>
<p>By the 1370's DR , the great helm style of helm was commonly issued in nations across the Eastern and Western Heartlands to various nobles, knights, cavalrymen and officers. These helmets typically had hinged visors, that opened either horizontally or vertically, and were paired with gorgets and plate mail.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , a group of duergar outfitted in iron bucket helms with visors ventured from their home in the Terminus Level of Undermountain up into the Runestone Level , determined to plunder a shrine dedicated to Laduguer and return their loot to their ruler Fazrian .</p>
