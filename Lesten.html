<p>Lesten was a Netherese archwizard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 3042 NY (−817 DR) , Lesten engaged in a spell duel with another archwizard, Buoyance . Over a century prior, Buoyance had already proven his worth in another spell battle, where he slew Kartaklys . Lesten's battle with Buoyance, however, was one of epic proportions. Elemental magic was fired this way and that, until there was only one victor: Buoyance. Lesten had crumbled to ash. Following his demise, the other archwizards of Netheril talked about the grand spell duel until their empire fell.</p>
