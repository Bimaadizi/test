<p>A yo-yo of fate was a rare and quite valuable magic yo-yo that carried the power to alter the course of one's fate in any given situation. They were particularly created to be used by bards or bardic jesters .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These yo-yos differed little in appearance from that of the mundane child's toy. They had a bright, cherry-red color to them and their strings radiated a faint yellow glow. Each instance of these yo-yos varied in its length of string, but typically had around 3​ to ​20 inches (0.076​ to ​0.51 meters).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The primary power of a yo-yo of fate was to alter the probability of events in any given situation to lean in the wielder's favor or make them "get lucky". When this power was activated the yo-yo of fate's string would shorten by 1 inch (0.025 meters), though it could be made to lose even further length depending upon how much the wielder wanted to alter the probability of events. Once a yo-yo of fate ran out of string its magical qualities permanently disappeared, rendering it as the mundane child's toy.</p>
<p>Additionally, when wielded in the hands of a bard or jester, the yo-yo of fate passively improved their abilities by a small margin.</p>
