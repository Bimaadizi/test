<p>Storm sorcery , also known as storm magic , was a source of power for sorcerers of the Realms that originated from the element of air .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The strength of elemental air was the source of these sorcerers' intrinsic magical powers. The majesty of the storm seeped into their very essence. These spellcasters embraced the unbridled power of the storms, incorporated it into their person, and let it loose upon others. To some it became an ally that accompanied them during their travels.</p>
<p>Some storm sorcerers were said to have lineages associated with the Elemental Plane of Air , and were descended in part from ancient djinn or even the immortal Wind Dukes of Aaqa . The lineage of other sorcerers was more obvious, such as windsoul genasi who tapped into their sorcerous powers.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>These sorcerers were readily welcomed aboard ships, especially mercantile vessels, sailing across the seas of Toril . Their unique powers allowed them to influence the wind and weather in their immediate vicinity, and other weather-related conditions at sea. Their skills also came in handy for fending off attacks by sahuagin , pirates, or other threats encountered at sea.</p>
<p>According to some, these sorcerers tended to be hot-headed individuals prone to bouts of rage. Yet others insisted they were dedicated people, who relentlessly pursued the causes about which they were passionate.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Through their mastery over elemental air, storm magic sorcerers gained fluency with the primordial language , along with all of its dialects.</p>
<p>Novice storm sorcerers gained at least some control over the air around them, and were capable of shaping it around them to momentarily fly over short distances.</p>
<p>Over time, their bodies became more attuned with the nature of storms. Magical or mundane lightning and the roaring sound of thunder became less harmful. Additionally, every time they cast spells that conjured, redirected, or otherwise utilized lightning, or manifested thunderous booms, a raging storm momentarily erupted from their body.</p>
<p>Storm sorcerers learned to deftly alter weather conditions around them, such as preventing rainfall within a 40‑foot-wide (12‑meter) sphere or by redirecting winds within a 200‑foot-wide (61‑meter) sphere, each centered around their person.</p>
<p>Experienced storm sorcerers became as one with the storm. Any would-be attacker that struck out at them would be retaliated against with blasts of lightning, while sorcerers became impervious to harm from lightning or thunder. Additionally, they harnessed the winds of the storm to attain a form of magical flight, up to a speed of 600 ft (180 m) per minute. They could also transport a handful of other people in this manner, at about half that speed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Second Sundering , beginning in the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the Sea of Fallen Stars became covered by a storm known as the Great Rain . The event darkened the skies and triggered enormous floods. Thousands of people perished by drowning, lightning strikes, or fist-sized gusts of wind that sank entire ships. A few survivors of these tragedies discovered they had intrinsic magical powers—considered either a blessing or a curse—that granted them control over lightning, thunder, and the wind itself.</p>
