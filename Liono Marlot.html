<p>Liono Marlot was the tactician of the hammership , the Probe .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Liono was a short and slender man. He had a quick tongue.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Liono was good friends with the ship's weapons master Bubbo , and the two spent much of their off-time sharing drinks in the officer's saloon aboard the Probe . He was also a long-time friend of the first-mate Aelfred Silverhorn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the journey from Krynn to Toril , while in the flow , the Probe was attacked by a neogi deathspider . As tactician, Liono's advice was to run fast, not because of cowardice, but because a deathspider's most powerful armaments were at its aft. Bubbo argued instead that they should turn and face the deathspider, since the hammership's most powerful weapons could only fire forward. The first-mate ultimately chose Bubbo's plan.</p>
<p>During the battle, the spidership pinned the smaller vessel in its grappling ram, and the Probe was boarded by human and demihuman slaves and raging umber hulks . During the bloody fight, Liono was impaled by a spear thrown from one of the assailants.</p>
