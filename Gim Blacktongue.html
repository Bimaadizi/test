<p>Gim Blacktongue was a mage and ruler of the kingdom of Doegan in the Utter East during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 â€“ 657 DR ).</p>
<p>Gim Blacktongue was a cunning mage who used treachery to usurp the throne of Doegan. Although the kingdom prospered, it did so under an air of suspicion, and Doegan folk called for a new and trustworthy rule. The leader of the Legendary Campaign came to Doegan and attempted to remove Blacktongue from power.</p>
