<p>The Wood of Sharp Teeth , formerly called the Glimmerwood , was a dense forest south of the River Chionthar , southeast of Baldur's Gate and southwest of Scornubel . It was a wilderness except for Durlag's Tower on the forest's southern edge. Uldoon Trail ran to the south east of the wood.</p>
<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The forest contained the site of the ruined (as of 1374 DR ) city of Vehlarr .</p>
<p>A small logging settlement of Hornhollow stood at the edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth. At some point before 1312 DR , the village was visited by a senile coughing red dragon that lit it aflame. With the creature's death, the logging operations resumed.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Two types of common medicinal herbs could be found growing within the forest: maiden's milk that was used to suppress cough, and bellows root that caused vomiting.</p>
