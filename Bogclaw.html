<p>Bogclaw was a lizardfolk in Twilight Marsh near Phlan in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bogclaw was a young and strong leader for his tribe. He hated Throstulgrael and did not accept serving him. In order to defeat the dragon, he was willing to do anything.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bogclaw was the heir of the Muckmarsh tribe, which was ruled by his father, Scalecrusher .</p>
<p>However, in 1489 DR, the black dragon Throstulgrael arrived, killed Scalecrusher, and enslaved the Muckmarsh and two neighboring lizardfolk tribes. The dragon declared a contest to elect a new leader of all lizardfolk: each candidate had to kidnap as many humanoids as possible and afterward compete against each other.</p>
<p>Bogclaw, believed dead like his father, did not agree with these conditions and tried to ruin the contest. To this end, he indirectly helped an adventuring party hired to save the kidnapped people, and the adventurers managed to ruin the dragon's plot.</p>
<p>Afterward, he led a coup to regain control of his tribe and then attacked the two other tribes. In the fighting, however, he was killed by the adventurers as they sought to protect the kidnapped people. However his shaman managed to save him from his wounds and back in action Bogclaw decided to hire an adventuring party to raid the Throstulgrael's lair profiting for a time that he was absent in order to have his vengeance against the dragon.</p>
