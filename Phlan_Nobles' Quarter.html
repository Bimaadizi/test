<p>The Nobles' Quarter , previously known as the Mansion District of Phlan , was a walled district found on the city's east side, on the far side of the River Stojanow . It was home to Phlan's wealthiest and most influential citizens and noble families.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>As befitting its affluent residents, the district was far better kept that the rest of the city. Its cobblestone streets were kept clean from dirt and clutter for the city's distinguished nobles.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Nobles' Quarter remained a part of Phlan's Old City , while being the only district that lay on the eastern bank of the Stojanow. It was the Nobles' Quarter around which the region of East Phlan was built.</p>

The district was plundered and stripped of much of its valuables and trappings of wealth. Bands of hobgoblins and Bane -worshiping orcs occupied the district's streets, spreading filth and threatening adventurers that sought to reclaim the richest area of Phlan.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Circa the late 1350s DR, it was said that the estates of the district held some of Phlan's greatest caches of treasure.</p>
