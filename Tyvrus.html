<p>Tyvrus was a Netherese shade and archwizard who led the forces of Netheril in an invasion of the Cormyrean prison-town of Wheloon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, Archwizard Tyvrus set out to form a conspiracy inside the Wheloon Prison , which was intended to recruit the entire population of prisoners to the Netherese cause, drive the Cormyrean forces from the city, and use it as a base from which to attack Cormyr itself, all while using the Shadowfell Nexus to move in and out of the fortified prison unopposed. This was ultimately designed to provide a distraction from the Cormyrean front with Sembia , where much of their forces were already focused, and allow the real invasion to strike from that direction when the Purple Dragons and War Wizards were drawn away. A third strike would come from the newly-created glacier enclave of Archwizard Amskar , bearing an army of orcs , giants , and other auxiliaries.</p>
<p>Though the Netherese were successful in establishing an outpost within the walls of the prison-city, their scheme was discovered by the Cormyrean adventurer Oriphaun Huntsilver , who sent word to the Cormyrean garrison asking for assistance. A party of adventurers was sent into Oldstone Hall to meet Oriphaun and find and capture the Nether Scroll that Tyvrus kept. While Oriphaun climbed up the side of the tower in an attempt to sneak in and abscond with the Scroll, the others entered by force, using Mirrors of Shadows to step between the material and shadow worlds and bypass the Netherese defenses. While Oriphaun was actually successful in entering the tower from a window and laid hands on the Nether Scroll , Tyrvus immediately caught and magically paralyzed him. The Cormyrean team arrived soon after and joined battle with the Archwizard, who used the Shadowfell Nexus itself as a weapon against them, though to no avail. The arcanist was eventually overcome and fell in battle, and the Nexus ceased with his death.</p>
