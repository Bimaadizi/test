<p>Anauroch ( pronounced : / ɑː ˈ n ɔːr ɑː tʃ / ah-NOR-ach or : / ɑː n ˈ ɔːr ɒk h / an-OAR-ock-h or : / ɑː ˈ n ɔː r ɒk / a-NAW-rock or : / ɑː n ˈ ɔːr ɒk / an-OAR-ock ), or The Great Sand Sea , was a magical desert in northern Faerûn . The Anauroch formed due to phaerimm magic in the Netheril (region) which was significantly different than the desert after ; more details about the geography and climate prior to Karsus's Folly in −339 DR may be found in the Netheril (region) entry.</p>
<h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
<p>Anauroch was bordered on the west by the Silver Marches , the Savage Frontier , and Evereska ; on the south by Cormyr and south-east by the Dalelands ; on the east by the Moonsea and the Ride .</p>
<p>All of Anauroch was a desert and suffered harsh winters, but the regions of the desert had distinct climates. During the height of Shadovar rule, in 1479 DR , the temperatures were moderated and it rained in the region , after the fall it returned to desert. Anauroch was commonly divided into three general regions, the northern High Ice , the middle Plain of Standing Stones , and The Sword in the south.</p>
<p>The High Ice was a frozen land of rocks and the black glacier. The Frozen Sea was often considered part of the High Ice, but it's landscape was a maze of frozen sand dunes which melted during summer in the southern regions</p>
<p>In the Plain of Standing Stones winds abraded jagged rocks that stood amidst a dry sea of gravel.</p>
<p>The Sword was a hot sandy desert.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<h2>Life and Society</h2>
<p>For a millennium after the collapse of Netheril , and the creation of the Anauroch due to phaerimm magic, the nomadic Bedine were the primary humanoid inhabitants of the desert. In the mid 1300s DR the Zhentarim invaded the desert with plans of creating a permanent trade route. Some decades later in 1372 DR, the Shadovar returned from the Plane of Shadow with the goal of restoring the land of Netheril , and parked their flying city Shade near the Scimitar Spires. Life in Anauroch was dominated by the changing fortunes of these three groups as they vied to exist and fought against the influence of the phaerimm from below.</p>
<h3>Bedine Society</h3>
<p>The Bedine survived by raiding and guiding caravans through the hidden passes, making their home on the surface of the wastes, traveling from oasis to oasis. They were divided into a dozen or so minor tribes lead by sheiks, whose wealth was measured not by gold , but by the size and well-being of their herds. The Bedine were good-natured and noble, and the encroachment upon their home by the Shadovar trapped them in an exposed position. [ citation needed ] Suspicious of magic at the best of times, they had to deal with a vastly superior magical force altering the environment around them. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h3>Zhentarim</h3>
<p>The Zhentarim , always eager to make a profit, fought long and hard to secure routes for their caravans through the desert. The northern routes across the High Ice were plagued by monsters too numerous to fight and in the south humanoid raiders and interference from the Dales and Cormyr hindered their efforts. After years of painstaking effort the Zhentarim created a caravan route via oases in the Sword , the sandy southern portion of Anauroch. The garrison constantly fought to defend its territory, but despite years of bitter fighting with the Bedine, the Zhentarim held little more land in Anauroch than that on which they stood.

<h3>Shadovar</h3>
<p>Initially upon their return, the Shadovar ignored the human inhabitants of the Anauroch , focusing instead on tempering the climate and exterminating the phaerimm. They went about altering the climate by magically creating the Shadow Sea where the Shoal of Thirst was , and melting the High Ice . By 1479 DR Rain fell, the temperature was moderated, and the Anauroch was an arid dust bowl spotted with youthful forests, rivers and grasslands. The Shadovar declared the phaerimm extinct on Toril.</p>
<p>During the interim, the Shadovar fought the Shadowbane War with the Zhentarim, and the Zhents lost control of the Black Road. The Shadovar also exterminated, subjugated or drove out a number of other species.</p>
<p>Their relationship with the Bedine was complex. Many former Bedine considered themselves citizens of Netheril by 1479 DR, and were residents of the rebuilt cities of Landeth, Orofin, Rasilith, and Oreme , or servants in Shade . They allowed other Bedine to live as herders with minimal harassment, but forbid them from practicing magic.</p>
<p>Other Bedine fought adamantly against them, allying with foreign powers and Zhentarim to resist Shadovar rule. A full rebellion began two years before Shade crashed into Myth Drannor</p>
<p>After the fall, Shadovar survivors clashed with Bedine around the Memory Spire, awakening a hive of dormant phaerimm , and the effects of their climate magic was undone.</p>
<h3>Phaerimm</h3>
<p>Below the dunes of Anauroch lurked what remained of the evil phaerimm , a race of reptilian spellcasters with near-unrivaled mastery of the Art , long imprisoned in a magical shell called the Sharn Wall under the desert. The phaerimm were forgotten by all but the wisest of sages until the barrier holding them was broken . After fighting the combined armies of most of Evereska , Evermeet , the Heartlands , the Chosen of Mystra , and the Shadovar —all at once—the remaining phaerimm were scattered beneath the surface.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −34,500 DR , the sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil rose to prominence. Throughout the Days of Thunder they ruled much of the land that would one day become Anauroch. In −33,800 DR , the Isstosseffifil empire's wizards rerouted the Narrow Sea in an effort to drown the phaerimm inhabiting Phaerlin . This resulted in a massive ecological change that devastated their empire. Eventually, their empire fell at the hands of the phaerimm and they were forced by the Netherese to scatter.</p>
<p>In −461 DR , the phaerimm started casting spells in the land of Netheril that eventually caused the creation of Anauroch.</p>
<p>After the fall of Netheril in −339 DR survivors from the three enclaves that were saved by Mystra formed the Lost Kingdoms in the southeast, but the sands, and conflicts, overtook them within hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In 10 DR , the Netheril region was renamed Anauroch, to reflect the great desert that the region had become. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>In 329 DR the Anauroch desert finally stopped perpetually expanding outward as the sharns defeated the phaerimms.</p>
<p>In 1038 DR , the sands of Anauroch began to spread out southward once more.</p>
<p>The arrival of Thultanthar in 1372 DR brought about significant change in the political and geographic landscape of the Anauroch. In that year, three Princes of Shade performed a ritual that created a huge storm above the Shoal of Thirst, and transformed it into the Shadow Sea. For around a year, they used shadow blankets to melt the glacier of the High Ice, before that plan was disrupted.</p>
<p>In 1385 DR the spellplague caused the merging of Abeir and Toril , creating changes in the landscape of Faerun, including large areas that collapsed into the underdark. Changes to the Anauroch were not specified, but a large area of the Frozen Sea was marked as the "Deep Maw" on a map from 1479 DR .</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , the Anauroch was an arid dust bowl spotted with youthful forests. The melted glacier created rivers and grasslands. Rain fell and the temperature was moderated. Some areas had grown lush and verdant.</p>
<p>In 1485 DR , Bedine rebels began a concentrated effort to overthrow their Netherese overlords following Netheril's war in Cormyr .</p>
<p>In 1487 DR , Thulanthar's cataclysmic destruction in Myth Drannor signaled the end of the Second Netherese Empire, and by 1488 DR the empire was reduced to a shadow of its former size. By this point Netherese forces and Bedine tribes were in full conflict, warring over key points in the desert. One such battle near the Memory Spire managed to awaken a hive of phaerimm sleeping within, causing the aberrations to begin leeching life from the land around them.</p>
<p>Some time after 1485 DR , the Anauroch was once more a desert.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>The ruins of the very first cloud palace , belonging to the father of the cloud giants , Nicias , were thought to be located somewhere in the great desert.</p>
<p>There was a Faerûnian folktale that stated the Anauroch desert was formed by a single golem . The construct was tasked by its master to shovel sand into the region, but was subsequently forgotten about. After continuing with its task for so long, it was said to have formed the desert.

<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Prior to 1372 DR , when the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar (also known as the City of Shade) re-emerged from the Plane of Shadow and began to reestablish Netheril in the Anauroch, the only permanent human residents were the nomadic Bedine tribes, and a small Zhentarim garrison, tasked with patrolling and defending a line of oases along the Black Road . The Shadovar brought Krinth with them from the Plane of Shadow, and some Shadovar were born as Shadar-kai .</p>
<p>A diminutive people called the D'tarig lived along the eastern borders of the desert and interacted somewhat frequently with peoples from the surrounding lands. Another minor group, seldom encountered, were the nomadic Armand who lived in the harsh desert in small groups.</p>
<p>The Asabi , or laerti, lizard-folk lived with the related stingtails in the mountains, in ruins, and in caverns under Anauroch, coming out at night to hunt. Groups of them were subjugated by various powers including the Sarrukh -liches of Oreme , the phaerimm of the Buried Realms , and the Zhentarim .</p>
<p>Blue dragons lived and hunted in the Anauroch , primarily in the northern regions. Young blue dragons had agreements with tomb guardians of Evereska on the edge of the desert to despose of robbers corpses. A society of blue dragons was associated with the Cult of the Dragon prior to the return of the Shadovar, who subjugated their draco-lich leader and deposed the entire cell of cultists.</p>
<p>A few barbarian human and Hobgoblin tribes , along with small numbers of ogres , hill giants , and Verbeeg lived in the valleys of the Plain of Standing Stones.</p>
<p>Death giants inhabited a number of Netherese ruins.</p>
<p>In the Sword, Goblin tribes were active in the southern region, where the Goblin Marches bled into the Anauroch and western region around the Black Road .</p>
<p>Gnolls were said to make up 5% of the non-Shadovar population in 1372 DR.</p>
