<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bill O'Shaughnessy was born in a nice well-off home and never struggled with money nor food. In his early years he was a merchant sailor and a member of Daggerford's Mariners' Alliance . He often remembered his maiden sea voyage with nostalgic tears in his eyes. During one of his early journeys as a member of the Alliance, Bill's vessel was caught in a violent storm, and to make things worse, attacked by a vicious kraken . The ship's captain was the first to be snatched by the kraken's tentacles. Left commandoes, the sailors panicked. Bill remembered stories of his sea-fairing grandpa and took command, telling his crewmen to arm their slings with lamp oil . The fiery ballistas lit the sea beast on fire, scaring the sod away and saving the vessel. That adventure prompted Bill's rapid promotion to the captain of the ship. Under Bill's command, they severed their tied with the Mariners' Alliance and became lawless "freelancers", as such, Bill took on a new name, Black Bill.</p>
<p>Around 1372 DR, Black Bill frequented the Black Stone Inn in Daggerford.</p>
