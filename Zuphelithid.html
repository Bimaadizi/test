<p>Zuphelithid was the elder brain that enthralled a community of svirfneblin near the ruins of Dolblunde for a time during the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Zuphelithid and its mind flayer followers enslaved a group of deep gnomes in order to find and claim an artifact known as the helmet of disjunction . The elder brain sought to use the helm to break into the ruins of Dolblunde.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the late 1400s DR, Zuphelithid dispatched mind flayer agents to recover the Helm of Disjunction from the stalwart, Thayan paladin Xenk Yendar . While the elder brain's plan failed, an intrepid pair of deep gnomes―who hoped to save their family from Zuphelithid's tyranny―managed to steal the helm from the paladin themselves.</p>
<p>The deep gnomes convinced Xenk Yendar to save their people, in a foolhardy and ultimately unsuccessful attempt of righteous do-goodery. The plan worked to Zuphelithid's advantage however, as the foolish gnomes allowed the Helm of Disjunction to fall into the elder brain's clutches. Unfortunately, the stubborn paladin and hapless gnomes would not be deterred. The gnomes drove a massive drill into Zuphelithid's lair, while the paladin from Thay broke into its inner lair, and slew the elder brain.</p>
