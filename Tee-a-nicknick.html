<p>Tee-a-nicknkick was a half- qullan pirate who plotted the assassination of Captain Deudermont with his companion, Creeps Sharky , in the late 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The half-qullan man had thick black hair tied in a topknot, and tattoos covering practically every part of his body, including his face. He wore a tiger-skin kilt, which exposed a lot of his skin. He struggled with speaking Common , and would often replace words with others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tee-a-nicknick was born to a qullan tribe on an unknown island. Being only half-qullan, his ferocious tribe of full-blood qullans rejected him as inferior. Tee-a-nicknick remained on the island until he was taken by a group of pirates. After this, the half-qullan sailed with humans for most of his life.</p>
<p>He became friends with a fellow pirate known as Creeps Sharky, who realized Tee-a-nicknick's skill with the deadly blowgun . The exotic warrior concocted the blowgun dart with a cat 's claw, feathers, and an oozing syrup. Among the shadows of a rooftop, the pirates waited for Deudermont to exit the Cutlass inn in Luskan and meet with Wulfgar and Morik . After Tee-a-nicknick blew his dart into the pirate captain, they then moved down the street and pretended to be drunks to avoid the authorities.</p>
<p>Tee-a-nicknick was later caught, brutally tortured, and killed at Luskan's Prisoners' Carnival .</p>
