<p>Daern of Hawksroost , also known as the Guardian of the Tome , was a warrior from the village of Hawksroost in the Ride in the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Daern became a devoted companion of Flaergon of Glister , a priest of Ilmater who dedicated himself to assisting miners and caravan-workers in the frozen north of the Moonsea lands. Flaergon was also the bearer of the Tome of Torment , one of holiest books of the Ilmatari faith. After Flaergon died of a fall in a chasm near Whitehorn in the Year of the Claw, 1299 DR , Daern took the Tome of Torment across all of Faerûn back to the House of the Broken God temple in Keltar , Calimshan .</p>
<p>Daern presented the Tome to the High Mistress of Worthy Suffering, Althea the Abased . Daern's devotion so moved Althea that she named him an honorary Brother of the temple. Daern became Althea's personal bodyguard, but his duties consisted largely of carrying the frail, crippled priestess around.</p>
<p>Althea the Abased finally passed on in the Year of the Gate, 1341 DR , and Daern mourned her passing. He was appointed to the new role as Guardian of the Tome, defending the artifact he'd once traveled so far to deliver. Unfortunately, within a year, Daern was murdered one night by a semi-monstrous man—Althea's predecessor, Bloirt Waelarn —who stole the Tome and escaped.</p>
<p>Even as of the late 15 th century DR , Ilmatari remembered Daern and his long journey in the saying "long and strong as Daern's devotion". As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , this phrase was the password to enter the Dolorous Adytum , an ancient Ilmatari monastery beneath Elturel where the wards of suffering were kept.</p>
