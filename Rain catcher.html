<p>A rain catcher was a simple contraption used to collect rainwater in the wilderness. They were considered an important tool for adventurers journeying into regions where sources of freshwater were unsafe to drink, such as in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The purpose of a rain catcher was to serve as a lightweight and mobile basin for catching rainwater. It comprised a 5‑square-foot (0.46‑square-meter) tarp made of leather that was stretched across a wooden frame that could easily be folded for transport. When erected, it could collect rain water at a rate of about 2 gallons (7.6 liters) per 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain, and it could hold up to 8 gallons (30 liters).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , explorers in Chult were advised to use rain catchers or to boil any river water in the jungles to avoid contracting throat leeches . The sale of rain catchers was strictly regulated in Port Nyanzaru —the only city in Chult at the time—with all sales being controlled by the merchant prince Ekene-Afa . They could be bought at the city's Red Bazaar for one gold piece .</p>
