<p>The Traitor's Gate was an oddly-named inner city gate that separated eastern and western parts of the Dock District in Phlan .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Traitor's Gate was separated from the Parkside Gate by the Valhegen Park , erected after the city of Old Phlan was rebuilt in the early-to-mid 14 th century DR . The Traitor's Gate stood on the southern side of the park, while the Parkside Gate was on the northern end.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After the city of Phlan was liberated from its monstrous invaders, ruled by the Possessing Spirit in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR , the old gate was given the name of the Traitor's Gate. The said traitor was infamous Porphyrys Cadorna , a disgraced First Councilman of Phlan who betrayed the trust and respect of the people of Phlan, attempting to seize control after Tyranthraxus ' defeat. Instead, he became the vessel for the dreaded Possessing Spirit. With his fall, Cadorna's pacts with the Zhentarim and other malicious entities became public knowledge. The Traitor's Gate was to serve as a reminder of the Cadorna family's disgrace.</p>
