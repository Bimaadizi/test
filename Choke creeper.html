<p>Choke creepers , otherwise known as strangler vines , were a rare type of carnivorous vine plant that could be found throughout much of the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The central stem of a choke creeper was typically 1‒2 ft (0.3‒0.61 m) thick, though some specimens were noted to have a thickness comparable to that of a tree, and could grow to be over 20​ to ​160 feet (6.1​ to ​49 meters) with several other vine branches fanning out from it in all directions. On average there were around four to eight vines along each 10 feet (3 meters) section of the choke creeper and sixteen at its center.</p>
<p>The vine branches of a choke creeper on average grew to be 9​ to ​16 feet (2.7​ to ​4.9 meters) and had an olive green hue. These branch vines had flexible tendrils that allowed them to move 5 yd (4.6 m) per minute. The smallest of choke creepers had around eight branches, while the largest typically had around sixty four.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Choke creepers possessed no form of sentience, but they were attracted to light, heat, and movement.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Any damage to the vines of a choke creeper would not harm the central plant itself. Small fires, such as that given by a torch , had no effect on them. Severe cold and cold-based spells could temporarily impede their movement. By contrast, running electricity through them was known to cause their vines to move faster.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These plants were so named for their tendency grapple unsuspecting creatures and squeeze them with a strangling grip to the point of death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existence of choke creepers on Toril dated back to at least the days of Netheril .</p>
<p>Circa 1367 DR , choke creepers began to grow beneath the waters of the River Ashaba , threatening the balance of that ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some speculated that the choke creeper may in some way be related to the hangman tree .</p>
