<p>Gondolo ( pronounced : /ˈ g ɒn d oʊ l oʊ / GON-doh-loh ) was an unsuccessful treasure seeker and the companion of his foppish friend, Faroul . Together, they hired themselves out as guides in Port Nyanzaru during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gondolo was a lightfoot halfling with a flabby build. He stood at 3 feet and 6 inches (110 centimeters) and weighed 80 pounds (36 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Gondolo enjoyed carousing and living a life of debauchery and gambling, especially alongside Faroul. He was notably lucky, especially when it came to narrowly escaping danger.</p>
<p>Gondolo was fond of sharing important-sounding facts. While he thought himself to be a philosopher, he often supplanted any actual knowledge with his own fabricated ideas. He further fancied himself as both a poet and a boxer.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gondolo and Faroul owned a triceratops named Zongo they intended to enter into dinosaur races in Port Nyanzaru. They used it as a pack beast due to its lethargic nature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Faroul was sent away to Port Nyanzaru by his parents, Gondolo joined him to help seek their fortunes and live the high life. In a matter of months, the two lavished their money away on gambling and earned significant debts with both the city's dinosaur race bookies as well as its merchant princes .</p>
<p>Around this time, Gondolo met a feverish explorer desperate for money to pay for a voyage home to Baldur's Gate . This explorer offered to sell him a treasure map and, desperate for cash, Gondolo agreed. The map showed the location of a deceased dragon's former lair . As Gondolo and Faroul didn't have the wherewithal to travel there on their own, they posed as jungle guides in the hopes that they could venture to the dragon's lair with a group of adventurers and equally split whatever treasure of the hoard remained.</p>
