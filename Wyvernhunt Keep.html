<p>Wyvernhunt Keep was a stronghold or fortalice in the foothills of the Storm Horns mountains of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was built into the side of a rocky slope, overlooking the High Road and near the hamlet of Wyvernhunt .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The name was wildly exaggeratedâ€”Wyvernhunt Keep was not much more than a large one-room. The roof and walls facing down the slope created a high-walled platform, where lookouts and archers could watch the ground below. It was surrounded by crumbling ramparts. It was counted as a ruin in the mid-1360s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Wyvernhunt Keep was originally used by brigands and was one of the bases of the forces of Gondegal , the so-called Lost King, during his uprising in the Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR .</p>
<p>By the 1360s DR, however, the Purple Dragons were uninterested in garrisoning it. Instead, travelers commonly used it for shelter, this being one of the few reasons to stop in Wyvernhunt.</p>
