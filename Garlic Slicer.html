<p>Garlic Slicer was a corrosive and offputting dagger that was created by the garlic -obsessed wizard Rab Bitnez .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garlic Slicer was an ordinary-looking short but sharp dagger that reeked of garlic.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Rab Bitnez peeled and sliced countless cloves in his life, so many in fact, that the blade's edge absorbed the properties of garlic, making it corrosive to unprotected skin, dealing acid -like damage when wielded in combat. The negative effect of the blade, however, was it's pungency, effectively reducing the owner's charisma.</p>
