<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , the Simbul assaulted a temple of Shar somewhere in Thay where the Red Wizard Azmyrandyr was preparing for an intrigue. Her goal was a revenge attack after Azmyrandyr participated in an attack on Silverymoon . During her attack, Azmyrandyr and his apprentices were rehearsing the impersonation of several notables from Nimpeth . Ilnabbath and Marlus arrived at the scene of the fight after Azmyrandyr and the four apprentices who were with him had been slain; the first ran off to sound an alarm, only to be eliminated with a single fireball on the spot, which Marlus ducked under. He then struck her with a feeblemind spell, which didn't have any effect.</p>
<p>By the time more people arrived to join the fray, Marlus had tried charging her, only to be dodged, and then hurled his own magic missile barrage, which also had no effect. Eventually, he noticed a warrior charging straight through her, and realized that the Simbul was employing an illusion; however, he was slain by friendly fire shortly after, as he was cowering within an active spider of Shar spell.</p>
