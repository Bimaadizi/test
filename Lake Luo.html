<p>Lake Luo was an alkaline lake located in the Valley of Embers , in central Chult , that fed the River Olung .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Due to nearby volcanic activity the waters of Lake Luo were excessively alkaline and could not support aquatic life forms. The nearby landscape was similarly affected and resembled a barren wasteland.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Lake Luo formed upon a literal hot bed of geothermal activity. It was kept warm by subterranean volcanic vents and received a steady stream of lava from the surrounding valley.</p>
<p>The water that flowed from the lake continued into the River Olung, though by that point, its acidity and alkaline levels reached more balanced levels.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Due to its inability to support natural life forms, only mud and steam mephits dwelled along the shores of the lake.</p>
