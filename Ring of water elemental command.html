<p>A ring of water elemental command was a ring of elemental command attuned to the Elemental Plane of Water , giving the wearer advantages against creatures from that plane, and some of those same creatures' advantages.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rings of water elemental command bore powerful dweomers and while many radiated their powerful enchantments, other rings hid their power from most types of detection, instead seeming to be rings of water walking .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The least subtle rings gave the wearer a constant advantage against creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water, hindered attacks from those same creatures, and let wearers understand Aquan , additionally it gave them the ability to move on water as if it was solid ground.</p>
<p>The rings had five charges that could be actively used to cast dominate monster on water elementals ; these charges were restored daily at dawn. If the wearer killed a water elemental while wearing the ring, they would gain the ability to breath underwater and swim as fast as they could walk. They also got the a ability to cast either create or destroy water , control water , ice storm , or wall of ice by using two charges of the ring. These advantages lasted until the ring changed ownership.</p>
<p>The more subtle rings, however, gave the bearer an aura of 5 feet (1.5 meters) where water elementals could not even approach, being actively repelled. The wearer could end the aura and instead attempt to charm water elementals, but unlike the less-subtle rings, there was a real risk of the elemental resisting and attacking the wearer instead. However like all rings, other creatures from the elemental plane would be hindered in their attacks. The wearer could still speak Aquan, but in addition creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water would either be compelled to respect the wearer if they aligned, or fear them if they did not. The ring would help against fire attacks on the wearer and grant the ability to cast airy water , purify water , water breathing in a 5 feet (1.5 meters) radius, and waterwalking as often as desired, create water , and wall of ice once a day, with lower water , and part water twice a week.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The very first ring of water elemental command was created during Netheril 's Golden Age (roughly −2207 DR to −1205 DR ) by the preeminent elementalist Yrix Alquinnar . It was from his work that all 'lesser' rings were copied by skilled creators through the long ages.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To create a ring of water elemental command required firstly a very experienced spellcaster, who not only specialized in forging rings, but also was able to cast summon monster VI and either water walk , create water , water breathing , wall of ice , ice storm , and control weather or dominate monster , create or destroy water , control water , ice storm , and wall of ice , depending on which type of the ring they would create. Additionally various ingredients costing around 200,000 gp would be required.</p>
