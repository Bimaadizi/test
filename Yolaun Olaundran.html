<p>Like most of the Olaundrans, Yolaun had grown soft and fat living the good life. As a general rule, he wore fine clothing made from a true gold-colored (never yellow) cloth called shimmerweave , trimmed in white or cream. When his fancy for fashion peaked, he could be seen wearing anything trendy and expensive.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Yolaun and his younger brother Bezrar had largely usurped the job of running the family business from Gauthklaun because he was getting old and frail.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Yolaun was the eldest son of Gauthklaun Olaundran , the patriarch of the clan. Yolaun had six children, the oldest being his daughter Rassalice . After her were two brothers, Elvolaer and Sardrin .</p>
