<p>Light makers were tiny sprite creatures that resided in and powered globe-like lighting mechanisms across the entirety of Mezro in Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tiny fey creatures had slender bodies that resemble those of elves . Their movements were graceful, and they did not have faces or any other features that allowed others to distinguish individual light makers apart.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The light makers appeared seemingly out of nowhere when a new magical globe device was crafted in Mezro. They showed up ready to work at all times.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Light makers lived in and operated Mezro's magic clockwork spheres that provided the city with light. When a light maker was inside such a globe, its intricate mechanism silently worked, rotating and pushing numerous gears and levers inside. Once tiny creatures left a globe, its light dimmed, and the gears slowed to a halt. To deactivate such a light sphere, it was enough to say "thank you" in the Tabaxi language into the ball. Four light makers could work one globe at a time.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Light makers powered all the light spheres in the Library of Mezro , found in the Scholars' Quarter .</p>
<p>The number of these orbs and individual light makers was unknown. They did not need to eat nor sleep and existed simply to work Mezro's many spheres. Dhalmass Rayburton theorized that light makers could be some sort of quasi-elemental beings that were whether summoned or compelled by the orbs' mechanisms.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Light makers have been working on lighting up the city of Mezro long before Dhalmass Rayburton's arrival to the Chult circa 172 DR , and remained active in 1362 DR , when Artus Cimber became one of the city's barae guardians.</p>
