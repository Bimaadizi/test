<p>An amulet of life protection was an enchanted piece of jewelry that offered protection for the psyche.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Such amulets built after the Spellplague resembled rough chunks of clear-cut crystal with a golden chain.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Early information on such amulets claimed they made one immune to mind blast alongside mental influence. They were partway effective against the lifestealing powers of a demilich . However, it was not useful against a Deck of many things , as it would simply be itself cast into a hidden plane with the wearer's soul still inside.</p>
<p>When worn, these amulets and brooches protected against magic jar and similar magical attacks that attempted to take control of the victim's body. If the wearer was killed their spirit would enter the amulet and remain for seven days, departing for the afterlife when this time expired. Destroying an amulet of life protection that housed a spirit would utterly annihilate the spirit.</p>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , such amulets as found in Raven's Bluff could prevent the passing of the soul into the Fugue Plane , allowing anyone to be resurrected within a space of 24 hours if they were healed.</p>
<p>Amulets created after the Spellplague increased the time through which one could still be raised from the dead, and improved the wearer's defenses in life somewhat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Mortimar of Netheril used one, smashed, to stage the death of his partner, Parzal .</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>The amulets used in Raven's Bluff required the magic jar spell.</p>
