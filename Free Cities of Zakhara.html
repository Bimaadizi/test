<p>The Free Cities of Zakhara were a group of city-states along the north coast of that continent .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Each of these city-states was located at the mouth of a river. The cities were Hafayah , Liham , Muluk , Qadib , Umara , and Utaqa . They swore fealty to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz , but maintained a larger degree of independence than other parts of Zakhara.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The Free Cities' independence was limited mainly by the nearby city of staunch Qudra and its mamluks. The Free Cities seemed less civilized than other Zakharan urban centers, as they had to contend with wild tribes on land to the south and pirates on sea . They were also the first stopping point for travellers from Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Main products of the Free Cities included clothing, rice, agates , semi-precious stones , pottery, coffee, indigo dye, purple cloth and clothing, and trade in northern goods .</p>
