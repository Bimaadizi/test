<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Volothamp Geddarm visited Elgath's Provisions in Archenbridge in Archendale , in the Dalelands , he tested proprietor Elgath 's claim that he could locate any desired item for sale within a day by requesting a Thayan web-of-bells dancer's costume. By the next meal that day, Elgath had found a Sembian collector willing to part with a spare, and even offered to have a fast rider collect it. Volo declined on the basis that it was not his size or shape.</p>
