<p>The Society of the Verdant Arrow was an anti-human organization that met at Mytela Halvasyn's house around 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Society advocated for the banishment of humans from Aglarond , thereby returning it to the way things were during the days of the Yuir elves . The members were particularly frustrated by the often-absent human ruler of Aglarond, the Simbul , and strongly opposed the Sons of Hoar .</p>
<p>The organization was led by Guthrae in 1368 DR , and later Caytran Halvasyn in 1374 DR .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The organization was made up of the half-elf descendants of Lady Mytela Halvasyn , namely those with significant wealth.</p>
