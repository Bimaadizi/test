<p>Gravia's hot apple cider was a popular and sometimes drugged apple libation prepared by Gravia Maxillian of the Maxillian Manor from the Western Farmlands circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gravia's hot apple cider was prepared using the fresh Maxillian apple orchard juice. A standard recipe called for half a gallon of freshly pressed juice, two cinnamon sticks, two whole cloves , two allspice berries, a handful of lemon and orange peel, slices into stripes.</p>
<p>Apple juice was simmered in a huge pot on the open fire along with the peel and spices neatly wrapped in a piece of cloth. A batch of Gravia's cider took about two hours to cook. These drinks were served hot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gravia Maxillian developed the recipe sometime after she was turned into a lycanthrope by Jonas Maxillian Senior . This cider was often used to lure unsuspecting passers by into the clutches of hungry werewolves . The guests were drugged, using knockout drops added to the stein of cider just before serving.</p>
