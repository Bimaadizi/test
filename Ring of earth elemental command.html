<p>A ring of earth elemental command was a ring of elemental command attuned to the Elemental Plane of Earth , giving the bearer advantages against beings from that plane, and some of those same beings' advantages.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rings of earth elemental command bore powerful dweomers and while many radiated their powerful enchantments, other rings hid their power from most types of detection, instead seeming to be rings of feather falling .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The least subtle rings gave the wearer a constant advantage against creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth, hindered attacks from those same creatures, and let bearer understand Terran , alongside giving them the ability to move through rubble, rocks, and dirt as they were a normal road.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rings had five charges that could be actively used to cast dominate monster on earth elementals ; these charges were restored daily at dawn. If the wearer killed an earth elemental while wearing the ring, they would gain resistance to acid attacks, the ability to move through solid rock as if it was mere difficult terrain, and the ability to cast either stone shape , stoneskin , or wall of stone by using two charges of the ring. These advantages lasted until the ring changed ownership.</p>
<p>The more subtle rings, however, gave the bearer an aura of 5 feet (1.5 meters) where earth elementals could not even approach, being actively repelled. The wearer could end the aura and instead attempt to charm earth elementals, but unlike the less-subtle rings, there was a real risk of the elemental resisting and attacking the wearer instead. However like all rings, other creatures from the elemental plane would be hindered in their attacks. The weearer could still speak Terran, but in addition creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth would either be compelled to respect the wearer if they aligned, or fear them if they did not. The ring would help against petrification attempts on the wearer and grant the ability to cast stone tell once a day, passwall twice a day, wall of stone once a day, stone to flesh twice a week, move earth once a week, and featherfall as much as desired.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The very first ring of earth elemental command was created during Netheril 's Golden Age (roughly −2207 DR to −1205 DR ) by the preeminent elementalist Yrix Alquinnar . It was from his work that all 'lesser' rings were copied by skilled creators through the long ages.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>To create a ring of earth elemental command required firstly a very experienced spellcaster, who not only specialized in forging rings, but also was able to cast summon monster VI and either stone tell , passwall , wall of stone , stone to flesh , move earth , and featherfall or dominate monster , stone shape , stoneskin , and wall of stone , depending on which type of the ring they would create. Additionally various ingredients costing around 200,000 gp would be required.</p>
