<p>Slicker was one of the many beggars who lived on the streets of the city of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Slicker was a rawboned human man with a light, unhealthy skin tone, brown hair, and brown mustache. He wore a beggar's rags. Slicker's eyes darted nervously around the street, and his behavior was reminiscent of that of a cornered animal.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>When Slicker was not begging, his demeanor changed to rude sarcasm, but he still referred to himself in the third person.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Slicker was begging on the Market Triangle of Westgate, when a nearby building exploded into a pyre. Unlike the destroyed building, a stack of crates owned by Belub-Zi , a well-connected merchant who manned his stall on the Triangle, was safe, as only a madman would dare to explode Belub-Zi's goods. Slicker decided to stick close to them as that was, in his opinion, the safest place in the area. When a group of adventurers interrogated Slicker about the fiery wreck, he revealed to them that all sorts of shady individuals were going in and out of the building, and recently, a group of new faces went inside, right before the explosion. In reality, the building was used by a group of cultists who worshiped the ancient lich Kokrulobis and the explosion was an attempt to rid the city of the cult's foul presence.</p>
