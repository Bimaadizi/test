<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Slaying Spells, 976 DR , Gerinvioch was approached by a party that included Aniolon Gruanthe . After slaying most of them with his breath, Gerinvioch heard out Aniolon; the human explained that he was looking for his aid, not his treasure. The dragon was intrigued, and accepted, on two conditions: he wanted an artifact brought to him, the Evise Jhontil , and he wanted the bodies left in his lair for him to eat. Aniolon agreed to both conditions.</p>
<p>After Aniolon sent people to acquire the Evise Jhontil , Gerinvioch used the relic to perform a ritual that created a barrier. He was interrogated a little by Umbeso , a fellow of Aniolon's, while performing the rite—the dragon claimed that the barrier would prevent entry as well as hide them from all forms of observation. The dragon was lying, however, as the barrier prevented only egress, not ingress, and a side effect of the artifact was that it caused the death of everyone inside who employed magic.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Gerinvioch was approached by Kinase Bronihim , who was seeking the Evise Jhontil . The dragon pointed him in the direction of Lliiress, where the wizard became trapped forevermore.</p>
