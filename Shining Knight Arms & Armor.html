<p>Shining Knight Arms & Armor was an armory shop located in Neverwinter in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located to the southwest of the House of Knowledge , in the City Core district.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Shining Knight was one of the best armories in Neverwinter, because its owner was a wizard who knew spells to help him to shape metal, and who also worked with dwarves to create good weapons and armor.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the shop was run by Durga , a half-orcish merchant who tried his best to keep the business afloat with the supplies drying out and the city being ravaged by a plague. When Durga met customers who looked like they knew value of magic weapons and armor, he enchanted a wardstone that allowed them entrance to the shop's backrooms, where Marrok the dwarf ran his forge. The dwarf knew secrets of strengthening enchanted items and improved magics weaved into weapons and armor with the ingredients provided to him. This service was only available to the shop's special customers.</p>
