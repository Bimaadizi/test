<p>Feldaern Jathlet was a member of the Jathlet merchant family in Delzimmer circa the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . Feldaern was one of the "forest of uncles" in the Jathlet clan—either a brother to Jolthur , the patriarch of the family until his unfortunate demise, one of Jolthur's uncles, or one of his first cousins. He was a taciturn man that pursued his own interests around the region, occasionally touching base in Delzimmer for a few days before traveling to some other business opportunity (legitimate or otherwise). When in town, he (and all the other uncles) exerted what influence he could on Elsraea Jathlet , hoping to guide the family business in the most favorable direction as he saw it.</p>
