<p>The Inn of the Weary Pilgrim was a mountainside inn somewhere in Faerûn , surrounded by tall trees, mountains, an asperii herd, and was visited by nobles (and presumably pilgrims ) in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the inn's garden's mint plants were ravaged, its fishing pond was emptied of its fish , mistletoe was plucked, and a visiting nobleman's pet hawk went missing. The panicked innkeeper hired a band of adventurers to uncover the culprits. It was revealed that a nearby heard of asperii might've been to blame; local hunters were planning to capture the young "wind steeds" for sale. Eventually, the heroes found out that the culprits were Silverhoof and Sparkle , young twin steeds, who had captured by a nearby nest of griffons to feed to their young. The adventurers met the missing twins' parents and allied with them against the hunters and the griffons, eventually saving the youths. The Inn of the Weary Pilgrim, however, had to come to terms with its losses.</p>
