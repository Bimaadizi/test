<p>Ulweth was a seasoned dwarvish hunter from the Crossroad Keep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ulweth had his brown beard groomed and braided. He wore primitive well-cured hide armor and a simple leather skullcap helmet . Ulweth used a crossbow for hunting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before or in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Ulweth was attracted to the stronghold of the Crossroad Keep by a promise of a challenging hunt. The locals suffered savage attacks by a pack of worgs that laired not far from the trade routes, attacking travelers who walked the plains surrounding the Keep. Ulweth theorized that the worgs came from the nearby Neverwinter Wood , forced away from their territory by something or someone. The dwarf planned to kill several worgs, forcing them to abandon the plains, and after that â€“ Ulweth was to travel to the Neverwinter Wood to uncover the source of the disturbance. The hunter did not target worgs for the reward as there was none promised; he also refused to team up with anyone else, claiming he was better at hunting alone. While his hunting operation was ongoing, he stayed at the Phoenix Tail Inn of the Crossroad Keep.</p>
