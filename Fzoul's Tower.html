<p>Fzoul's Tower was the home of Fzoul Chembryl of the Church of Bane and the Zhentarim .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower was located in Zhentil Keep's Inner Quarter right next to the Black Altar near the heart of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The narrow tower stood five storys tall. It was constructed of stone with a square shape, though a wooden stable and annex were found at the base which marred the structure's symmetry.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of Fzoul's Tower held a feast hall, laboratory, office, and main bedchamber. Many hidden passages were found beneath the tower, connecting it to strategic locations in Zhentil Keep. The most useful of these connected to the Black Altar and was accessed by a magically silenced trapdoor.</p>
<p>A private altar of Bane was located beneath the Tower.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>A trio of wyverns guarded the roof of the tower. The creatures followed simple commands given by anyone wearing the robes of a priest of Bane. An eye tyrant lived in the subterranean passages.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tower was traditionally used as the personal home for the head of Bane's church in Zhentil Keep, who, as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , was Fzoul Chembryl.</p>
