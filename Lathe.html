<p>A lathe was a mechanical device used by artisans to work various materials.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Wood, metal, and stone could be turned on a lathe using specialized blade bits to cut the material, creating regularly shaped staves , spindles, columns, rods, candlesticks , and other rounded components used for weapons, tools, furniture, and other items. A power source such as a water mill could be used to operate a lathe, sometimes with a gear to adjust the speed appropriately. Maillers used a lathe that didn't carve the material, but instead coiled wire into loops that were then cut and riveted , ultimately being made into chain mail .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered a 20 gp lathe that could hold a 2‑foot (61‑centimeter) by 6‑inch (15‑centimeter) piece of stone or wood to be worked. They also offered woodcutting bits (5 gp) and stonecutting bits (15 gp) alongside it.</p>
