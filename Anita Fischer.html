<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Anita and Elias Fischer suffered a terrible loss. The couple's seven-year-old daughter Lily was murdered, leaving her parents grief-stricken. Anita and Elias planned on burying their daughter in the Lower City Graveyard , but the undertaker carpenter, Ulkov Sully , demanded a priority fee for a coffin due to a massive backlog of funerals caused by the skyrocketing numbers of murders in the Gate. Without paying the fee, something the Fischers could not do, it would've taken a month of wait time. Anita and her husband tried their best to get Lily buried via negotiations and demands from the Valmorba and her mortuary.</p>
