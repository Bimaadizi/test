<p>Elminster's castle was an old stone keep that acted as one of the wizard Elminster 's many getaways.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>Originally known as Blackhammer's hold, over the years this keep bore many names. These included Uruld’s Folly, Halardraco’s Fang, the Archenfang, the Silent Keep, and (as a mocking title by Simbul ) Elminster’s Grand Castle.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This keep was located high in the Thunder Peaks , not far southeast of Thunderspire Mountain .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>A ward placed upon this building by Elminster made it look from afar to be a mere mountainspire.</p>
<h3>Interior</h3>
<p>The interior of this building was rather barebones and quite dusty. Devoid of furniture. It had some portals within it, including one that connected it to Elminster's Hideout .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Elminster utilized this keep as a source of temporary shelter and storage. He also used it as a place to practice and experiment with the casting of new spells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This keep was carved out of a mountainspire by the dwarven clan Blackhammer , who used it as a project for their young masons and stonecutters in training. The Blackhammers filled the fortification with traps and had only a few dwarves stationed within it, using it as a base of operations for dealing with the dragons , wyverns , and other monsters of the nearby area.</p>
<p>Eventually this fortification was abandoned and discovered by humans in the early days of Archendale . The people of that dale cleared out the keep's traps, hoping to use it as part of their efforts of expanding Archendale's reach into the Thunder Peaks and establish mines. However, in time they abandoned these plans and the keep along with them.</p>
<p>Over time Elminster and the Seven Sisters would clear the keep of opportunistic dragons and brigands on many occasions, until eventually they decided to shroud it with a ward and use it for their own purposes. At one point Elminster would bring the Simbul here to make love, who was thoroughly unimpressed with the barebones structure.</p>
