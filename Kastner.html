<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , High Priestess of the Spider Queen Azurna was leading the drow forces in the divine quest for the Flame Sword of Lolth . The magic weapon was the long-lost artifact from the War of the Seldarine , hidden in Undermountain . The drow built a coalition to find the item and bring down Waterdeep . During that pursuit, Kastner was stationed in one of the deep strongholds. She held a position supervising the younger clerics of the Spider Queen. One of the priestesses was Eskylla , a traitor to Lolth. The young cleric had been introduced to the faith of Eilistraee and wanted to escape Azurna's army. She achieved freedom with the help of Khelbenite , who agreed to murder Kastner during his struggle against the evil conspirators.</p>
