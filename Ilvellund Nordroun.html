<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He had little patience in the field, and was mindful of the chain of command.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was commander of the Highknights of Cormyr , and he was well-regarded. He had also trained some highknights.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had been the one to train Merlar .</p>
<p>During the raid where he died, Ilvellund Nordroun was part of a team that included Merlar , Eskrel Starbridge , and Therlon . Kelgantor was the leader of the full squad.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilvellund Nordroun was tapped for the raid on Tethgard in Mirtul 5 of 1479 DR , after the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar , who had stolen the Royal Gorget of Battle was finally tracked there. He was at loggerheads with Shuldroon , a war wizard who tried to give the orders in the squad, eventually outright refusing an order from the latter when he told him to bind the Simbul , a sorceress and previous queen of Aglarond , when they found her with Elminster.</p>
<p>Once the combat began, he continued to countermand Shuldroon's orders, even as casualties increased. After the raid, Eskrel Starbridge became the head of all highknights, clearly signaling that Ilvellund had not been among the survivors.</p>
