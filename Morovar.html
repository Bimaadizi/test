<p>Morovar was a larger town found in the Barony of Morov in Damara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Morovar sat on the eastern bank of the Goliad River in the southwest corner of Morov.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Once the capital of the barony, Morov was on the decline in the 1350s DR . This was a direct result of Dimian Ree moving his seat of power to Heliogabalus . Many of Morovar's wealthy nobles abandoned the city to follow their lord, taking much of Morovar's spirit with them.</p>
<p>Morovar's lack of a firm ruler left them nearly helpless when faced with a conflict since the local militia was painfully slow to organize.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Many of Morovar's citizens felt scorned by their lord's departure and secretly dreamed of allying with Brandiar .</p>
