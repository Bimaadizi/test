<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hesketh opened the Swamp Rat in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR . It immediately stole customers and business from the Bold Bard , previously the only tavern in town, which angered its owner Shortshanks . However, the later ghost sightings around the Swamp Rat from Mirtul 27 onward drove customers back to the Bold Bard.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Hesketh was eager for business by Eleint 17 , after the ghost was revealed to be a fake. That night, he served various customers, including Jasper , Bortas , and others, and rented king's envoy Grodoveth a room.</p>
