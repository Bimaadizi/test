<p>Valanice Daventhorn was an antiquarian who joined the Cormanthor Elves during the reclamation of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Valanice had short white hair and pale eyes. She wore a pale yellow dress decorated with sun symbology.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1374 DR , Valanice and her daughter Rosella joined the Myth Drannor outskirts camp , examining the relics brought out of the ruins. In particular they were intrigued by those items which were perfectly intact and uncorrupted despite all that passed in the city. These golden age weapons (and the warped fallen age gear) became a particular interest of the pair, and they would trade and swap for these items when adventurers brought them out of the ruins.</p>
