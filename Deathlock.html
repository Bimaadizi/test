<p>Deathlocks were undead spellcasters bound to serve a master. They were usually the remains of warlocks , reanimated by their patrons after failing to fulfill their part of a pact, but could also be created by necromancers .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Deathlocks did not have any goals that they had in life, aside from fulfilling their patron's desires. This urge to serve their patron was overpowering and consumed their every thought.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All forms of deathlock had an innate spellcasting ability that allowed them to cast detect magic , disguise self , and mage armor .</p>
<p>Beyond their innate spellcasting ability, deathlocks retained some of the spells of their living counterpart. These typically included the following:</p>
<p>However, the arsenal of spells that a deathlock had could vary widely depending upon what patron they had.</p>
<h3>Masterminds</h3>
<p>Deathlock masterminds had access to a larger arsenal of spells than the average deathlock. These additional spells typically included blight , counterspell , crown of madness , darkness , dimension door , fly , hold monster , minor illusion , and poison spray . Though again, this arsenal could vary widely depending upon what patron they had.</p>
<p>Besides spells, a deathlock mastermind was capable of shooting necrotic bolts at their enemies.</p>
<h3>Patron Spells</h3>
<p>Those with with an Archfey patron were capable of casting the spells blink , faerie fire , hunger of Hadar , hypnotic pattern , phantasmal force , and sleep . In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells dominate beast , dominate person , and greater invisibility , and seeming .</p>
<p>Those with a Fiend patron were capable of casting the spells blindness/deafness , burning hands , command , fireball , hellish rebuke , and scorching ray . In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells fire shield , flame strike , stinking cloud , and wall of fire .</p>
<p>Those with a Great Old One patron were capable of casting the spells armor of Agathys , detect thoughts , dissonant whispers , hunger of Hadar , Tasha's hideous laughter , and phantasmal force . In addition to these, a mastermind had access to the spells clairvoyance , dominate person , Evard's black tentacles , sending , and telekinesis .</p>
<h3>Wight</h3>
<p>Deathlock wights were sensitive to the light of the sun and could drain the life from living creatures. Those slain by their draining touch would arise as a zombie under its command. And much like a mastermind, they could shoot necrotic bolts.</p>
<p>They lacked the spells of their living counterparts, though could cast the trio of spells that all deathlocks could innately do. In addition, deathlock wights could innately cast fear , hold person , and misty step .</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR , Valindra Shadowmantle potentially raised the Neverwinter Nine as deathlock wights and unhallowed wights .</p>
