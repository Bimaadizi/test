<p>Duthspurn was a Zhentilar swordsman in the mid-14 th century DR . His legs were recognizable.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was known to have multiple legs, almost certainly two. His legs were easily recognizable.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He was wearing boots prior to his death. Those were not needed to recognize him.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was under the command of Lyrkon , in a squad including the mageling Fimril . The swordmaster Lyrkon could easily recognize him by his legs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1357 DR , Duthspurn's squad struck at Shandril Shessair , with intent to capture, in Hullack Forest . As a countermeasure for her spellfire , Fimril used a spell of all-consuming darkness, which generated a slowly advancing dark band ahead of his men. Shandril's spellfire could not penetrate the barrier, but by striking under the band, she managed to disintegrate one of the men's legs; he tripped forward, screaming, and fell into the band of darkness, which annihilated selectively the top half of his body.</p>
<p>Though their capture initially succeeded, it was at the cost of five casualties of their own, including Duthspurn himself, who had been reduced to a pair of legs. This was sufficient for his identification.</p>
