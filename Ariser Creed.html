<p>The Ariser Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. They sought to dominate the surface world. They believed that the best way to obtain exclusive knowledge was by attacking knowledge storehouses on the surface. For many years, the Arisers wished to plunder Candlekeep .</p>
<h2>Bases</h2>
<p>The Arisers had a base called the Darkened Vault in Oryndoll . It was a minor faction in the city, unlike in other illithid hives.</p>
<p>This Creed also founded a colony at Tellectus , with the aim of stealing from Candlekeep.</p>
