<p>Basult's Books was a bookshop located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr , on the western end of the city. Circa 1374 DR , it was the only bookseller in town, and was run by Amnic and Mela Basult .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the month of Eleint in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Amnic went missing; he was last seen in his shop, where signs of a scuffle could be found. Although distraught, Mela tried to manage the bookshop in Amnic's absence.</p>
<p>Eventually, on Eleint 6 , adventurers discovered that the new Temple of Mystra in town was actually a front for priests of Shar and Cyric to kidnap magic-users and spirit them away to the Vast Swamp for some nefarious purpose. Investigators found Amnic's body in a torture chamber beneath the false temple. Mela was informed of her husband's fate.</p>
