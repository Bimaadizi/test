<p>Bleth was a noble family of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1360s DR, the Bleth family was one of the more powerful and wealthier noble families of Cormyr, thanks to its control of the Seven Suns Trading Coster , one of the largest merchant groups in the kingdom. The family was headed by Lord Gruen Bleth .</p>
<p>In the late 1360s, Lord Gruen and Lady Amarsa Bleth were guests of Lord Partic Thistle at his manor, Thistleflame Keep , on the occasion of King Azoun IV 's birthday.</p>
<p>The house was exiled in 1369 DR as a result of its involvement in the Abraxus affair .</p>
<p>After the Fire Knives were driven from Cormyr, it was revealed that a number of members of the Bleth house were involved with the Fire Knives, causing the family to be exiled in 1359 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the 1360s, the Bleth family had little involvement in the affairs of Cormyr's Royal Court. Instead, the mercantile Bleths focused on expanding their business and dominating the Cormyrean finances. They were successful and wielded great economic power.</p>
<h2>Base</h2>
<p>The family was based at the Bleth Estate in the city of Suzail , Cormyr . It was situated beyond the Royal Gardens , near Castle Obarskyr .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The main rival to the Bleths was the Rowanmantle family. There was a long-lasting but minor feud between them, still ongoing in the 1360s DR. The Bleths were also held in poor regard by the Roaringhorn family. It had been this way for centuries by the 14th century, and nobody remembered why.</p>
