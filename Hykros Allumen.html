<p>Hykros Allumen was the high priest of the Hall of Justice of Tyr in Waterdeep in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hykros was a devoted follower of Tyr and a bastion of law in Waterdeep. He was also a student of the early forms of the church of Tyr , believing that over time Tyr's original message had been diluted. Hykros particularly rejected the notion that Tyr was the latest incarnation of Anachtyr , a common belief in south Faer√ªn . He was so against this notion that he was prejudiced again non-Northern followers of Tyr. Hykros also believed in a rigid separation between the Tyrran cleric, monk, and paladin paths.</p>
