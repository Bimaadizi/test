<p>The metacreativity discipline of psionics revolved around the creation of semi-solid or solid objects, animated constructs , and even forms of matter, through the use of raw ectoplasm (or other raw matter) drawn from the Astral Plane . Some of the most representative powers of this discipline included astral construct , concealing amorpha , ectoplasmic shamble , psionic create food and water , and wall of ectoplasm . Its equivalent among the schools of magic was conjuration . Much like the conjuration school, metacreativity had a subdiscipline called Creation .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Metacreative powers could only manifest constructs and objects within their respective range, upon an open surface capable of supporting it, though they did not need to remain within those limits. They could not be manifested inside of another creature or object, nor could they be made to manifest from a floating position in an empty space.</p>
<p>Despite being made of diaphanous ectoplasm, any object created with metacreative powers could be as solid and durable as ordinary objects. Constructs would usually obey the commands of those who manifested them, though their obedience was not an absolute guarantee.</p>
<p>Metacreative powers with temporary durations held their creations together through the use of psionic energy , with the construct or object vanishing once the power manifesting them ceased or became negated, leaving behind bits of liquid ectoplasm that would soon evaporate thereafter. Powers with an instantaneous duration assembled things through psionics that would last indefinitely, though they could still be dissipated into their constituent ectoplasm with the metacreative power dismiss ectoplasm .</p>
<p>Individuals experienced in the art of psicraft could identify materials that were created or shaped through the use of metacreativity powers.</p>
<p>Creatures that were immune conjuration magic were typically likewise immune to metacreative powers.</p>
