<p>The Ankheg Tribe were a tribe of nomadic hunters of the Shaar in the mid–14th century DR . They roamed the area in the middle of the Shaar, between the Firesteap Mountains and the Shaarwood and between the Landrise and the Duskwood .</p>
<p>They adopted the ankheg as their symbol and their raiders adopted a fighting style similar to the monstrous beast, in which they hid in long grass, lying prone before springing to a surprise attack.</p>
