<p>A folding coracle was a magical coracle , a boat favored by the Ffolk of Moonshae . It was similar in general principle to a folding boat , though not quite as impressive.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The folding coracle was a round boat of the "skin and strut" type ( animal skin over a wooden framework). It measured 8 feet (2.4 meters) in diameter with enough room for six human -sized passengers. With a command word, it could be collapsed and folded down to a playing card-sized piece of leather for easy storage and concealment (it could even be sewn inside an article of clothing to further escape notice), or unfolded and enlarged again to form the coracle.</p>
