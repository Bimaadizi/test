<p>Grue were outsiders that lived on the elemental planes and were like animals of the four elements.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>There were few commonalities between the different types of grue expect for a negative disposition.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>They were spawned by the taint of evil magics in the elemental planes and would eagerly leave their home planes at the first opportunity.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>At the heart of every grue lay a pearl-like object with inscriptions prized by many a mage for their use in elemental spells. These fist-sized objects came into being alongside the grue itself and were the only thing to remain were they ever slain.</p>
<p>All grues could be summoned with the spell summon monster IV , although killing a summoned monster just returned it to its home plane, thus making it useless for obtaining the prized spell-object.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>All grue hunted vermin and acted as guardians and pets for the other inhabitants of the four elemental planes.</p>
<p>It was not known whether or not there were grues of the para- and quasi-elemental planes.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
