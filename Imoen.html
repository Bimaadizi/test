<p>Imoen ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ m m oʊ ɛ n / IMM-oh-en )was an adventurer and mage that traveled across Faerûn during the mid–14 th century DR . She was one of the mortal children spawned by the deity Bhaal a decade before the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She had wide eyes and a manner of speech that was beyond her years.</p>
<p>Imoen was a decent enough cook and knew some information about brewing. In her youth she was quite knowledgeable about the goings-on in Candlekeep , due to her inquisitive nature.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Imoen had quite an upbeat disposition and was never one to hold a grudge. Her ordeal with Jon Irenicus , let Imoen walk away permanently hardened and traumatized. She hid the iron in her heart behind her youthful face and blithe tone. When Imoen was reminded of the hardships she endured, her carefree attitude broke for a mere moment with a lip quiver and a painful memory.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Imoen had a good relationship with her adoptive father Winthrop . He was rather lenient with Imoen, allowing her to run wild in Candlekeep.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Imoen was born in the city of Baldur's Gate . Her mother passed away during childbirth and she was promptly adopted by the gruff but jovial man named Winthrop. In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Winthrop and Imoen traveled south to the library fortress of Candlekeep . Her adoptive father eventually came to the run the Candlekeep Inn within the austere keep. She grew up alongside Abdel Adrian , the adoptive son of the sage Gorion ; a young man she believed to be her friend, but who was in fact her divine sibling.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Gorion abruptly left Candlekeep with his foster child in care. While snooping on the elder mage , Imoen got wind of his plans and followed the pair as they fled in the middle of night. She witnessed Gorion's death at the hands of Sarevok Anchev , and did her best to comfort and console her friend.</p>
<p>Following the end of the iron crisis of that year, Imoen began studying the arcane arts under the tutelage of Liia Jannath , one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>In the month of Uktar , she was reunited with her companion as they ventured through the familial tomb of the Korlasz family in search of the last remaining disciple of Sarevok. A couple of weeks passed until they were reunited again in Baldur's Gate. On the night they both stayed at High Hall , Imoen and her sibling were attacked by assassins working for the Shining Lady . Imoen was afflicted with a non-lethal poison and took quite some time to recover.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Abdel was framed for the murder of Skie Silvershield and imprisoned within High Hall. After he was discreetly freed by the Grand Dukes, Imoen rallied some of their allies and accompanied them from the city. Among them were the Rashemaar berserker Minsc , the Wychlaran Dynaheir , and the married couple from the Harpers , Jaheira and Khalid . Unfortunatley the group was quickly ambushed, and taken to a dungeon in the far-south city of Athkatla .</p>
<p>The group was captured by the sadistic mage Jon Irenicus and his vampire "sibling" Bodhi . Imoen and her own sibling were tortured and experimented upon in an effort to unlock their divine power. Somehow Imoen freed herself and freed her companion from his cage. After encountering the thief Yoshimo they ventured out of the dungeon complex and into the open market of Waukeen's Promenade .</p>
<p>They arrived to see their captor slaying a few members of the Shadow Thieves guild. Imoen and Irenicus exchanged words and a few spells in a heated exchange, before being stopped by the Cowled Wizards . As they both openly cast arcane spells in the streets of the city, they were arrested for the illegal use of unlicensed magic and taken for judgement, and imprisoned within the asylum of Spellhold on the island of Brynnlaw .</p>
<p>Irenicus quickly freed himself from the control of the Cowled Wizards. He continued his experiments on Imoen, hoping again to unlock the powers she unknowingly had as a Bhaalspawn . Irenicus managed to extract Imoen's divine soul and instill it within his sibling Bodhi, in an effort to restore the extended life she would have previously had as an elf . While Abdel managed to break into Spellhold, he was captured as well and similarly had his Bhaalspawn essence and his soul drained from him to supplant Irenicus' lack thereof. The pair and their companions were left to rot in the dungeon maze beneath the asylum as Bodhi's playthings.</p>
<p>After a journey that took them through the Underdark , the drow city of Ust Natha , and an elven war camp near the Forest of Tethir , Imoen's sibling was able to return to Athkatla and confront Bodhi in her lair beneath the city's Grave District . Finally she was slain, her body was staked through the heart and Imoen's soul was returned to her.</p>
<p>By the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Imoen found a new calling. She joined a very recently assembled secret organization that monitored rumors, cults, and dangerous happenings that were of some relation to dead or forgotten gods. Imoen found herself traveling and investigating rumors for the organization under an alias "Neomi." She was well informed about local rumors, stories, and, alongside the organization, she kept an eye on notable individuals, such as the infamous Hero of Neverwinter . In 1373 DR, "Neomi" found herself in the far northern town of Lonelywood , looking into the recent strange nightmares that were sapping locals's strength and the appearance of a strange blue-skinned shaman . When she met the Hero of Neverwinter at the Ramshackle Inn , "Neomi" hand-waved their supposition that she was a Harper , stating that the organization was much younger, however, she refused to name it.</p>
<p>Imoen was believed to have died some time before the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , as the only two remaining Bhaalspawn at that time were Abdel Adrian and Viekang .</p>
