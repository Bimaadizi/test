<p>Fireworks were a type of low explosive in the Realms designed for the purpose of entertainment and aesthetic displays. Those who made or handled fireworks were sometimes known as pyrobolists .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fireworks produced a sort of popping sound when they went off, usually in a rapid succession that could be heard from great distances, and dazzling displays of colors and lights in the sky. Through the use of dyes , different effects could be achieved. Some fireworks required a mortar in order to be shot into the air, while others flew by their own propulsion.</p>
<p>Smokepowder was used in the production of fireworks. More specifically, small, magically limited kernels known as fireseeds . These were what imparted fireworks their distinctive "popping" noise.</p>
<p>The smell of fireworks was compared by some to that of brimstone .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Across the Realms, fireworks were produced in Baldur's Gate , Lantan , Shou Lung , and in Waterdeep . The fireworks made in Shou Lung were exported all across Kara-tur and even farther afield to the Blade Kingdoms and western Faerûn 's Sword Coast , though Shou fireworks were an uncommon sight in Waterdeep. Outside of Kara-Tur, fireworks were considered by some to be a rather Gnomish field of crafts, with some becoming quite devoted to their making. Most fireworks in Waterdeep were produced by rock gnomes .</p>
<p>In the city of Baldur's Gate, Felogyr's Fireworks had a monopoly on fireworks production, as its owners were the only Baldurians with a license to produce smokepowder, a state of affairs that went as far back as the shop's founding. In the late 1360s DR , the prices for fireworks ranged from 25 to 75 gold pieces .</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of Gondar temples produced and sold fireworks. Beyond manufacturers, fireworks were found to varying degrees in Calimshan , Delzimmer , Gana , Halruaa , the Blade Kingdoms , Neverwinter , Ravens Bluff , and Westgate , as well as in the City of Brass in the Plane of Fire ,</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>Though fireworks were designed for recreational purposes, like any explosive they could become dangerous if misused or handled improperly, both to the person operating them and bystanders, ranging from burns to serious wounds. For safety it was often recommended that one wear gloves while handling them, to ignite them at arm's length, and to be mindful of wind direction.</p>
<p>Animals, such as dogs , could be frightened by the loud noise they produced.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Fireworks were often used at festivals and celebrations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1357 DR , fireworks had been a common fixture in the nation of Shou Lung for several hundred years. Meanwhile, in the city of Westgate , they were considered to be a relatively rare sight around 1368 DR , being viewed as a luxury.</p>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , the arcanaloth Yrkhetep impersonated Khan Kertep and led his barbarian army against the city of Hlath in Chondath . During the siege of Hlath, in the heat of battle against the city's gathered defenders, he set off fireworks to confuse and frighten the Faerûnians, counting on them having no experience with them.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Iakhovas attacked Baldur's Gate with his army of sahuagin and other sea creatures as part of the Twelfth Serôs War . Adventurers Khlinat Ironeater and Jherek Wolf's-get managed to kill many sahuagin and repel the attack by detonating a wagon full of kegs of smokepowder and fireworks that they had gotten from Felogyr's Fireworks.</p>
<p>Celebratory fireworks became a common occurrence in the skies of Halruaa following the nation's victory against the Crinti in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<p>Sometime in the Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR , a disguised Imbralym Skoond visited Felogyr's Fireworks and bought everything it had in stock, as well as all of its raw materials, under the alias "Horus Kope", on behalf of Grand Duke Torlin Silvershield . Initially he sought to break Felogyr's monopoly on fireworks, having Skoond line up suppliers so he could arrange to produce more smokepowder, though his plans were derailed by Bhaal 's growing influence on his mind. By 1492 DR , Felogyr's continued to have a monopoly over fireworks in the city.</p>
<p>Following the end of the High Sun Games , the downfall of Forge Fitzwilliam and Sofina , and the liberation of Neverwinter and the Neverwinter Wood in the late 1490s DR, the people of the area celebrated with a display of fireworks in the air between the city and the forest. These were watched by the adventurers responsible— Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Kira Darvis —from a wood elf tree village in the forest.</p>
