<p>Hammer golems were a rare variety of golem unique to dwarven civilization.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hammer golems were primarily made of stone and resembled bearded dwarven warriors wearing plate mail , which was crafted from adamantite . In place of forearms they had a large hammer on their right arm and a large axe or pickaxe on their left. Those built specifically for warfare had the axe, while those built specifically for mining often had a pickaxe on both arms.</p>
<p>They typically stood 9 ft (2.7 m) tall and weighed around 2,000 lb (910 kg). Like many golems, their movement was rather heavy and slow.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These golems were only known to attack creatures if they were orcs , being prevented by them from completing a task, or ordered to by their master. Attempting to get at something that a hammer golem was guarding also fell under the second trigger. Whenever engaging orcs and their kin in combat, hammer golems always let out a hollow roar.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hammer golems were immune to most spells , except for wish and stone to flesh . In addition, they could only be harmed by weapons with a +1 or greater enchantment .</p>
<p>Through their weaponry they were capable of unleashing a sort of pounding force that was comparable to the spell repulsion .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When lacking a master, hammer golems would fight creatures around them until they either fled or were killed. However, they would relentlessly pursue the destruction of goblinoids .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Creation</h3>
<p>The process of creating hammer golems was highly secret, comparable to that of the most powerful dwarven magical weapons. They were only known to be forged by the High Old Ones, the high priests of the Morndinsamman faith.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Hammer golems were typically used as guards, warriors, and even miners.</p>
<p>Beyond their use by mortal dwarves, they were often divine agents of many deities within the Morndinsamman. They were typically used by the dwarven gods Berronar Truesilver , Clangeddin Silverbeard , Deep Duerra , Gorm Gulthyn , Laduguer , and Moradin .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time prior to -75 DR , four hammer golems were constructed in the land of Tethyr to guard the chapel-house of the Knights of the Crescent Moon that stood in the Omlarandin Mountains , the Chapel of the Blooded Moon . After the Eye Tyrant Wars , in -75 DR the hammer golems were situated in tunnels deep beneath the chapel. They were tasked with guarding the Knights of the Crescent Moon as they slept in stasis from the spell Phezult's sleep of ages , waiting for the prophesied day in which they would awaken to fight the beholders once more.</p>
<p>Hammer golems were detailed in a book about horrors of Underdark , True Tales of Underearth by Emerald Hapworth of Waterdeep in the mid 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>The hammer golems remained relatively undisturbed for centuries until 1370 DR , when the beholder Vaxall and his Doom Brigade stormed the complex with the intention of destroying the Knights of the Crescent Moon. His Doom Brigade managed to destroy two of the four hammer golems, leaving the group of adventurers on their trail to face the others.</p>
