<p>A wand of size alteration was an enchanted wand allowing the wielder to change the size of other creatures.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This wand allowed the wielder to influence the size of a target creature similar to either the enlarge or reduce spell , affecting a 50% change in the target's size and all of their carried equipment. The relative strength of the creature would change accordingly. The target needed to be within 10 ft (3 m) for the magic to function.</p>
<p>The effects of a wand of size alteration could be cancelled by a successful dispel magic spell, but doing so ran the risk of traumatically shocking the target. These wands could be recharged by wizards and each use of the wand used a single charge.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali , the Grandfather of the Everlasting in Zakhara , carried a wand of size alteration .</p>
