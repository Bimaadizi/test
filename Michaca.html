<p>Michaca , also known as the City of Gold , was a city of Azuposi situated in the Pasocada Basin in Maztica .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The concept of Michaca was conceived by Chief Tapeyzin when he saw that men had been corrupted by personal greed caused by the abundance of gold in the area, and he set about using the excess wealth to create a fitting tribute to the gods in the shape of a city, rather than for personal gain.</p>
