<p>Delasko Sornstern was confident Indur knew the consequences of lying, and he would kill him for leading him false.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late Mirtul of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Delasko Sornstern confided to Broryn Windstag that the blueflame ghosts which had been seen slaying across Suzail were returning afterwards to Stormserpent Towers , strongly implying Marlin Stormserpent , their co-conspirer, was behind these ghosts' activities.</p>
<p>He attributed the revelation to his servant Indur, who tried to follow the ghosts, only to find they vanished through a wall; upon checking, the servant could find no illusion or secret door.</p>
