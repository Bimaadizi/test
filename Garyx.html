<p>Garyx ( pronounced : /ˈ g ɛər ɪ k s / GAIR-iks ) was the chaotic evil dragon god of fire , destruction, and renewal.

<h2>Worshipers</h2>

At spring equinox, they held the Sanctification of Renewal, in which they examined the ashes of the All-Consuming Night bonfires for any useful remains they could reuse to make new objects.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −26,000 DR , Garyx led red dragons , and then all dragonkind, in a war against the giant empire of Ostoria that lasted one thousand years. Giant traditions had that the god of giantkind, Annam All-Father , made a truce with Garyx by agreeing with him to settle the war with a game of wah-ree . So skilled were the two opponents, that the game ended in a stalemate, and the war came to an end.</p>
