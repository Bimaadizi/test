<p>Fey were creatures from the Feywild , a parallel plane to the Prime , the Feywild was also called the Plane of Faerie. Many were typified as having supernatural abilities and a connection to nature or to some other force or place. The language of the fey was called Sylvan .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many were typically humanoid in shape.</p>
<h2>Species of Fey</h2>
<p>There were many different species of fey, and connections between them could be hard to identify, other than being natives of the Feywild. A few common threads could be drawn between certain smaller groups, however, while some were simply impossible to classify. [ speculation ]</p>
<p>Some fey were strongly bound or associated with specific natural locations such as water bodies, landmarks, or other geographical features. These included dryads , hamadryads , nymphs , naiads , nereids , oreads , and fossergrim . [ speculation ]</p>
<p>Other fey were reported as being born from emotions felt while in the Feywild, manifested due to that plane's strange energy. Redcaps , meenlocks , boggles , and mites were all included in this group.</p>
<p>Another group that was easily identified were the hags : annises , bheur hags , sea hags , green hags , shrieking hags , and bog hags were all considered. Night hags , although related, were actually fiends .</p>
<p>One group of fey was confusingly called sprites , despite this being a specific name for one of its included members. All "sprites" were small, mostly humanoid fey, that typically displayed some insect-like attributes (such as wings). Besides the classical sprite for which the group was named, there were the sea sprites , shrub sprites , the light makers of Chult , grigs , nixies , pixies , and atomies . The winterling , despite also being small and winged, was not included. Conversely, the sakina of Zakhara were considered "sprites", despite not exhibiting any of the typical features of one.</p>
<p>Yet another diverse group of minuscule fey were the gremlins , who descended from goblins transformed by fomorian rituals. They included the fremlin , galltrit , jermlaine , snyad , and the plainsjan that inhabited the planet Anadia in Realmspace . Mites were also considered by some to be members of this group.</p>
<p>Of course, many fey could not be classified into any larger group beyond being related to either nature or emotion. [ speculation ] These included:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Stories about the fey went back eons, to the Days of Thunder . Some claimed that fey creatures known as the le Shay were one of these creator races , who had created or progenerated the many kinds of fey, possibly including elves .</p>
<p>Following the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , an ancient fey kingdom known as Sarifal returned from the Feywild to takeover the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles .</p>
