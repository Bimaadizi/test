<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sigurd was a warrior of Earthfast and an ally of the Harpers .</p>
<p>He made a number of journeys to Rashemen .

He also visited the cities of Immilmar and Kront . His guide on some of these travels was Ygsvar .</p>
<p>On his travels, Sigurd spent a great deal of time with the Rashemaar and their berserkers , making many friends among them and growing quite fond of the people, their country, and their firewine . He decided he liked them because they were very dwarf-like, for their underground dwellings and their capacity for ale and firewine. Sigurd grew quite familiar with them and their ways.</p>
<p>Sigurd wrote a report on Rashemen for the scribe Lhaeo Rhindaun . Lhaeo used it as part of his report on the Unapproachable East , sent to Lady Alustriel Silverhand of Silverymoon in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR .</p>
