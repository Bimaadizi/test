<p>Memories of Kuldahar was an enchanted club fashioned out of a massive branch of the Great Oak of Kuldahar and believed to be a gift from Silvanus , the Oak Father.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Memories of Kuldahar carried the Great Oak's magical warmth, protecting its wielder from cold. The same nature magics made the club a powerful enchanted +1 weapon.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the town of Kuldahar was besieged by forces of the baatezu Belhifet that poured over the Spine of the World , being fueled by the foul magics of Crenshinibon . Under the onslaught of evil, the Great Oak was battered by the fierce ice winds of the Frozenfar , reducing the tree's magical circle of warmth that sheltered Kuldahar. During these storms, several branches were snapped off the Great Oak. After the siege was over, these branches were collected by the town's inhabitants and kept in their homes as a symbol of Kulpahar's perseverance in the face of grave odds. With time, several of the branches found their way to the Ten Towns , and one became a magical club known as Memories of Kuldahar .</p>
<p>At one point before Mirtul of the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Memories of Kuldahar was in stock of the Gallaway Trade Depot and available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in Targos .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Memories of Kuldahar ended up in the grabby hands of one of the verbeegs under Slabhead 's command, who herded a tribe of snow goblins in the Fallen Crags of Icewind Dale in attempts to stop any Ten-Towners from passing through the area.</p>
