<p>Estann Rabruin was an entrepreneurial human man who founded the community of Rabruin's Tor near the Hullack Forest .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Estann was a forceful, unscrupulous and energetic man who pursued his goals with ruthless ambition.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Estann was a successful and wealthy woodcutter and wainwright.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Estann had five sons who lived with him on the Tor and after his death, who were generally timid and passive compared to him. His eldest, Torstryn Rabruin , was perhaps the most assertive and proactive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1330s DR , Estann bought and developed a plot of land atop a crag next to the East Way near the Hullack Forest, naming it Rabruin's Tor. At the same time he sponsored a project to cut a new road, the Hullackheart Trail , from the Stag's Skull Bridge at Thunderstone to his new home at the Tor. But King Rhigaerd Obarskyr II , not wanting Estann's woodcutting to disturb potential threats in the forest and the long-term effects of his new settlement growing further, banned woodcutting within a half-day of the Bridge, effectively ending Estann's ambitions before they could be realized.</p>
<p>After Estann died sometime, his sons continued to live and work on the Tor with their own families as of the late 14 th century DR.</p>
