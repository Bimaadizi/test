<p>Krakens ( pronounced : /ˈ k r eɪ k ɛ n z / KRAY-kenz or : /ˈ k r ɑː k ɛ n z / KRA-kenz ), called lopok by the locathah , were enormous, ocean-dwelling magical beasts .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were akin to squids except larger in size, with a body almost 30 feet (9.1 meters) long. They had a similar body, with a ring of tentacles surrounding a mouth connected to a conical central body. Two of its ten tentacles were longer than the rest and had deadly barbs. The kraken had very large eyes, and fins protruded from the upper part of its elongated central body.</p>
<p>When younger, krakens resembled a pale squid.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Krakens were highly destructive and evil creatures. With their strong tentacles and massive strength, they could pull an entire ship down into the ocean. They often completely wiped tropical islands of all life, and deep beneath the ocean, they had cavernous lairs where they bred human slaves to feed and tend them.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Krakens attacked predominantly with their tentacles. They could both constrict opponents and bring them into the reach of the creature's huge jaws. In addition, krakens could also release an enormous cloud of jet-black ink , regenerate severed limbs, and even cast spells.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Krakens could speak some languages of surface-dwelling races but most commonly spoke Common and Aquan .</p>
<p>In the area around Serôs krakens were known to be actively hunted by both storm giants and merrows , keeping their population low.</p>
