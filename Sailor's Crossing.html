<p>Sailor's Crossing was a harborside cobblestone plaza decorated with a fountain at its center, located in the city of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The plaza stood on the crossing of several streets at the edge of Eastway , a single city block northwest from the Low Lantern and south of Fisher's Warf . The street called Admiral's Way began on the next block to the southwest.</p>
<p>The plaza smelled of salty sea breeze and spayed water mist from its tiered fountain with several copper coins in its waters.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , on Kythorn 19 , the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. A dead elf minstrel wearing a glued-on beard was found dead at the fountain's base. A large anchor was embedded in the man's chest. The adventurer and detective named Tav begin the investigation of the murder on Kythorn 20 , later returning to the crime scene on Kythorn 22 . By that time, the body had been removed by the Flaming Fists and sent to the Harborside Hospital with only a couple of poleaxe -armed guards keeping an eye on the site.</p>
