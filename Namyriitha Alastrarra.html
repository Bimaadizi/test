<p>Lady Namyriitha Alastrarra was the Speaker of House Alastrarra from the 3 rd to the 7 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was smooth and beautiful, making it difficult for any but a trained eye to determine she had not been young for centuries. Her rage was only ever betrayed by her eyes; her voice was commanding.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>On the evening of the Year of the Hippogriff's Folly, 241 DR , when Riluaneth was slain, she wore a plum, revealing yet courtly gown that flowed constantly, covering some parts of her in rainbow droplets and laying others bare. The gown later flowed into a sculpture of interlaced spines, from which her hair flowed normally. The lower half of her gown could be removed independently.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was used to being obeyed. Even in difficult situations, she watched for her family's honor, warning her younger members of the house not to gawk at humans too lustily.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She could enspell a sword to reveal who'd used it to kill.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>One of his fellow guardians was named Noldorn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241 DR, Namyriitha Alastrarra tracked down Elminster Aumar , who had shapeshifted into Iymbryl Alastrarra and wore his kiira , after he slew Riluaneth . She then called for Ornthalas Alastrarra as Elminster requested, wanting answers. She ultimately did not kill Elminster.</p>
