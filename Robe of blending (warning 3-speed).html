<p>The robe of blending (Waring 3-speed) was a magical item , robe , and worse invented by the mage Nimrod of Nump of the Misbegotten Realms .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Apparently a normal robe in all respects, its clasp possessed a sliding switch with four settings: off, chop, mix, and liquefy.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearer blended into the environment, ground, and indeed air to a degree defined by each speed setting. When the switch was turned on, it caused increasing amounts of injury to the wearer inside, culminating in "makes me sick just thinking about it".</p>
