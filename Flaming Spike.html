<p>The Flaming Spike were a large orc tribe living in the Akanapeaks and in the city of Airspur in Chessenta in the 14 th century DR . They comprised a number of smaller tribes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The orcish tribes had had long history of fighting and trading with the humans of Chessenta. They had launched a number of uprisings against them.</p>
<p>To guard against incursions by the Akanapeaks orc tribes, the fort of Rodanar was established by the warlord Tchazzar of the Chessentan Empire ( 929 â€“ 1018 DR ).</p>
<p>When a bloody civil war erupted between the orc tribes of the Akanapeaks, many refugees of the Flaming Spike tribe went to Airspur. They went into business as traders, intermarried with humans, and soon gave rise to a burgeoning population of half-orcs. In time, the priests of Bhaelros in Airspur were deposed and replaced by a military council led by Khrulis and half-orcs held many positions of political power by the late 1350s DR. They were, by all reliable reports, a significant improvement.</p>
<p>In the 1350s DR, the Flaming Spike got involved in wars in Chondath . They suffered many casualties as a result.</p>
<p>Around 1357 DR , the Akanapeaks orcs were making increasingly frequent raids against the city of Reth. The citizens wanted to attack the orcs, but their rulers feared Reth would be destroyed if it came to war.</p>
<p>Later, the Flaming Spike launched an uprising in the Gap of Reth (the only pass through the Akanapeaks linking Reth and Airspur ). An army including Bashar , Morka Kodolan , and Evern Marsh held them off until reinforcements from Cimbar could arrive; half the rearguard was slain.</p>
<p>After the Spellplague of 1385 DR , a portion of the world of Abeir was swapped with western Chessenta in 1386 DR , causing utter catastrophe. The city of Airspur was destroyed when a vast crevasse opened beneath it. Many were killed and the survivors fled into the Akanapeaks, back to orcish kin and the safety of the mountains.</p>
<h2>Lands</h2>
<p>The Flaming Spike lived on the western slopes of the Akanapeaks (which formed the border between Chessenta and Chondath) and in the abandoned dwarven mines that had been dug into the mountains some three thousand years before.</p>
<p>After the civil war, a number of orcish tribes formerly of the Flaming Spike lived in the city of Airspur. They gave rise to a significant population of half-orcs that quickly came to dominate Airspur, making up 30% of the population. Some also lived in Reth.</p>
<h2>Population</h2>
<p>In the 1350s DR, their population in the mountains was estimated to be about 50,000, though this would be reduced after significant losses in the wars in Chondath. It was still reckoned as being in the tens of thousands around 1372 DR . They were the second-most populous race in Chessenta after humans and they were included in estimates of Chessenta's population.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>These orcs were reputed to be barbaric and cruel, as well as ferocious, but this seemed largely exaggerated. They did seem more aggressive with regards to Chondath.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>In fact, they rarely initiated attacks against humans. Rather, the majority of conflicts between the Flaming Spike and Chessentan forces were started by Chessentans. The Rodanar garrison enthusiastically sought chances to fight and kill the orcs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Flaming Spike orcs usually made raids into western Chessenta, such as on the herds of sheep and cattle that grazed by the north shore of the Akanamere and into eastern Chondath, at the village of Nun and the cities of Hlath and Reth.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Orc warriors of the region were typically very tough and could charge into battle with great skill. They were commonly equipped with breastplate armor and wielded bastard swords or falchions , all well made.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>In addition to Orc , the orcs of the region tended to know Chessentan , and some could also learn Chondathan , Draconic , Giant , and Turmic .</p>
