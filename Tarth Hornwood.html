<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before 1360Â DR , Tarth Hornwood had been the chosen heir-in-art of Nerndel in Amphail , who gave him his staff . With the staff, Tarth took to adventuring, exploring tombs in the Dragonreach , and plundering other places too, including Myth Drannor , where he acquired the ring of Murbrand . At some point, he was tricked by Sarlin.</p>
<p>In late Mirtul of 1360 DR, he sought out Elminster Aumar for training, meeting Aelrue in Shadowdale right before reaching him. Once there, Tarth offered him the ring of Murbrand in exchange for training. Though Elminster was not against training him, he wanted him to destroy Nerndel's staff instead. Having come to rely on it, Tarth asked for a few days before they performed the staff-destroying rite. In those days, he commissioned a copy of the staff from Sarlin, who took four days for its creation. On the way back from Sarlin, he hid the real staff at a temple of Mystra , protected by his strongest wards.</p>
<p>He soon after completed the rite with Elminster, who revealed afterwards that he knew he'd traded away the ring for a fake staff. Teleporting his staff to Tarth, Elminster left him, and Tarth resolved to complete the ritual for real. He fainted after the destruction of his staff, waking up to find Elminster and a woman, Nimra Ninehands, who had been trapped as his staff. Elminster explained the story between Nimra and Nerndel, and that Nimra would become his tutor in the art.</p>
