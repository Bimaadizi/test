<p>The Laughingflow , also known as the Trollflow in Nesmé , was a river located in the Evermoors in northwest Faerûn . The name 'Laughingflow' was a rough translation of the original Elven name, which had it self been lost over time.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Emerging from a lake somewhere within the Evermoors, it flowed west and joined the Surbrin at Mornbryn's Shield . The Laughingflow drained the southern moors, and the land on the other side was relatively barren, in stark contrast to its name.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The clear, fast-flowing river had a gravel bottom and banks lined with felsul , laspar , and a few blueleaf trees. Its water was drinkable but had a sharp mineral tang.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The river was home to many edible crabs , a few shalass , many schools of the small brown lout , and also slimy but edible black-and-green rock eels that inhabited the river bottom.</p>
<p>The Laughingflow was seen as unsafe, for trolls , orcs , and barbarians would lay in wait nearby to ambush travelers on the river.</p>
<p>The ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar , known as Old Gnawbone, sometimes drank from the lake that fed the Laughingflow.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Riders of Nesmé constructed several palisades, earthworks, and base camps along the Laughingflow.</p>
<p>To the south, the town of Yartar stood at the confluence of the Surbrin and Dessarin rivers . Its people fished the Surbrin, Dessarin, and Laughingflow, which they called "the Three Rivers".</p>
