<p>Nyaril was one of several local merchant families in Arabel who held great political power in that city. They were primarily grain merchants.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Nyarils sold and traded grains primarily within the city of Arabel and had little business elsewhere in Cormyr. They were in strong competition with foreign consortia in the region.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Their large, walled manor was located in the north of the city of Arabel, in the richest part of the city among other tall mansions. The manor sat between the Falcon's Rest inn and the Watchful Shield and was across the street from a large grove that contained a temple to Sune .</p>
<p>The family owned and operated four large warehouses located at the southeastern corner of the city, near the wall and south of the Swinging Gate inn.</p>
<p>The southernmost warehouse had dimensions of 50 feet (15 meters) by 200 feet (61 meters), with a 20‑foot-high (6.1‑meter) arched roof. Its walls were made of thick wood, and its floor of stone. It had no ceiling, only rafters. There was a small basement. A set of large double doors entered the warehouse from opposite ends.</p>
<p>The southern end of this warehouse contained an inventory office, a large goods area, a break area, a manager's office, and several storage stalls.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1360 DR , the Night Parade , seeking revenge against Myrmeen Lhal for her victory over them the prior year in Calimport , purchased the southernmost warehouse from the Nyaril family, which they then established as a base. Within the warehouse, the elite squad of monsters were constructing a gate to the Demiplane of Nightmares , from which they intended to summon reinforcements. The gate required power from five lightning bolts per day over a period of ten days to be activated. Lord Tempos , their leader, summoned thunderstorms each night to charge the gate .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>There was a market for basilisk poison sacs in Arabel, and House Nyaril was rumored to possess maps that detailed the migration routes of basilisks in the Storm Horns and Thunder Peaks mountain ranges.</p>
