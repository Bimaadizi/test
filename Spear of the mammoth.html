<p>Spear of the mammoth was an enchanted spear created by Graendel Granitefist of Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft in Targos in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Spear of the mammoth was created from a magic +2 spear and a woolly mammoth 's tusk. The weapon was imbued with the namesake animal's vigor and kinetic force. The finished spear possessed a potent +3 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and made the weapon's damage more deadly. Additionally, it boosted the wielder's constitution and allowed the wielder to knock their opponents prone as if they were stricken by a charging mammoth.</p>
