<p>House Fathomlin was a drow house with a long and tumultuous history and one of the ruling Houses of Menzoberranzan in the Northdark in the late 14 th century DR ,</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>House Fathomlin's history stretched back to before the Third Crown War . Its last scion, circa −10,500 DR , was a dark elf wizard named Lyrna Fathomlin of Miyeritar . Lyrna resided in Myth Akherynnar in Miyeritar when the Dark Disaster ravaged her homeland, turning it into the desolate High Moor circa −10,500 DR . After the failure of the Myriad Ritual to halt the Killing Storms, and the subsequent destruction of the city of Faer'tel'miir , she and a procession of other dark elven high mages departed Myth Akherynnar on a suicide mission to drive the Killing Storms into Aryvandaar , the land of the conquerors who had conjured the storms in the first place. They departed on a three-day journey to the Tosofome Caldera to enact their ritual. Somehow, Lyrna became separated from her group, and found herself 90 miles (140 kilometers) off course in the ruins of Faer'tel'miir . There, she encountered a sharn , and was subsumed by a sharn symbiote to be assimilated as a new sharn.</p>
<p>Despite that ancient tragedy, House Fathomlin survived and its dark elves became the drow of the Underdark . House Fathomlin rose to its Ruling Council status sometime after the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR and before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , when it sat as the nineteenth House of Menzoberranza . However, it lost its status and was considered largely destroyed later in 1372 DR.</p>
