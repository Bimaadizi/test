<p>Minimals , a contraction of "miniature animals", were various breeds of half-sized animals found on the isle of Bulta within the Pirate Isles . Generally speaking, they were miniature versions of various mundane mammals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Minimals were exactly like their normal-sized animal relatives in every aspect.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures conformed to their full-sized counterparts in most respects, but had chaotic tendencies. Carnivorous minimals were slightly more aggressive.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Compared to their full-sized counterparts, minimals exhibited a greater degree of resistance to spells that charmed them, such as the animal friendship spell. And they were incapable of becoming familiars .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Minimals generally would not attack creatures larger than themselves unless they had superior numbers. Rather, carnivorous minimals preyed upon creatures smaller than themselves. They fought in the same manner as their larger counterparts.</p>
<h2>Notable Minimals</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Compared to their full-sized counterparts, minimals had a greater tendency to group or herd together.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>In the wild, minimals were sometimes found in the company of small humanoids or fey , such as brownies , dryads , leprechauns , and pixies . And due to their size, minimals were attractive as popular novelty pets for the various pirate holds in the Pirate Isles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was believed that some form of powerful magic was used to created the minimal animals found on Bulta. The entire environment on the island appeared to have been magically altered as even the trees were half-sized. One rumor persisted that the entire island of Bulta was once much larger.</p>
