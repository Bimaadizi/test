<p>A flask of vapor was a simple brass bottle that, when opened, released a continuous flow of fog until stoppered.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The flask would create a large disk of fog with a maximum size of 100 feet (30 meters) across and 10 feet (3 meters) high. Once that maximum volume was filled the flask would not release any new fog unless the current fog was blown away by natural or magical means.</p>
