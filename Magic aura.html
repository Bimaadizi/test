<p>A magic aura or magical aura was a type of aura , an invisible property that indicated the strength and nature of the magic possessed by a magical item or a spell , and by certain mages.</p>
<p>The detect magic spell allowed a spellcaster to examine magical auras in their vicinity.</p>
<p>Arcane spellcasters could also possess a magic aura, and this revealed their nature and make-up to other mages. Such auras could also be passed down through family lines. For example, the wizard Kyriani Agrivar bore the magic aura of her father, the renowned wizard Ostus Agrivar . This allowed Kyriani to control the Great Door that Ostus had created and only he and co-creator Parwyyd Hanifar could control. Parwyyd described Kyriani's magic aura as "odd", owing to her complex origin as a re-merger of the divided being Cybriana and Kilili . When split up again, Ostus's magic aura went with Kilili, who'd been born of the essence of the dark side of Ostus and his magic. When Cybriana and Kilili re-merged into a new Kyriani, she retained the necessary aura and was able to close the Door.</p>
