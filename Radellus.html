<p>Radellus was a mage at some point before the turn of the 9 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>By the end of his life, Radellus had wearied of Amn's intrigues.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point before the turn of the 9 th century, Radellus decided to retire to a tower east of Sreve , and slew the previous owner, Justal Iroon , for it. During the battle, a local young boy of the village, Kurtal , snuck in and made out with three of Justal Iroon 's spellbooks, which he then used for practice. Radellus flung Justal Iroon's smoking body the length of Sreve's main street; it was then whisked into the millpond, killing all its fish.</p>
<p>At some point afterwards, but still prior to the year 797Â DR , the same young boy, now an experienced mage, came and blasted him to ashes.</p>
