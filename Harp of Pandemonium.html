<p>Harps of Pandemonium were enchanted discordant harps , named after the plane of Pandemonium .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When the strings of harps of Pandemonium were plucked, the instrument produced unpalatable disconsolate sounds that affected creatures that could hear the discordant "music". Listeners affected by the sounds became dazed and confused . When a talented bard played a harp of Pandemonium , they could coalesce the sounds into fields of chaos that reduced the enemies to a band of babbling fools.</p>
<p>Each harp of Pandemonium held fifty charges, and each use of ether daze or confusion musics expended said charges. Confusion exhausted two charges, while daze took a single charge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR , several of these turbulent instruments could be found along the Sword Coast and the Moonsea regions.</p>
<p>One unique harp of pandemonium once belonged to Ravel Puzzlewell , a notorious night hag who resided in the planar city of Sigil . Ravel angered Sigil's god-like entity only known as the Lady of Pain and was imprisoned within magical maze for eternity. Ravel's harp of pandemonium was among the hag's artifacts left behind in Sigil. While it was unknown how Ravel's harp appeared on Toril , it came into the possession of a merchant named Deidre , a member of Aurora's Magic Emporium , during the 14 th century DR . Sometime prior to the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR she began selling her wares in the Adventurer Mart of Athkatla .</p>
