<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The o-yoroi was a comprehensive ensemble of laced armor, comprising various components such as kote , do-maru , sode , haidate , kabuto , and sune-ate . Additionally, it included several smaller pieces, including the mempo (face mask), nodawa (neck guard), wakibiki (armpit guards), sendan-no-ita, and hato-wo-no-ita (guards for the front of the armpit).</p>
<p>Crafted as a matched set, the o-yoroi exhibited harmonious colors and patterns that complemented each other. This not only enhanced the visual appeal but also improved the overall fit of the armor, resulting in a superior armor compared to a collection of mismatched pieces.</p>
