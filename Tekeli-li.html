<p>Tekeli-li ( pronounced : / t ɛ k ɑː ˈ l i l i / teck-ah-LEE-lee ) was a gnoll vampire , and a former Fang of Yeenoghu that lurked in Icewind Dale during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tekeli-li was once a mortal gnoll, who led his pack across the frozen lands of Icewind Dale . In the Year of the Striking Falcon, 1333 DR , the local Reghedmen barbarians routed the pack, forcing them to flee across the Reghed Glacier . To ensure their survival, the pack sacrificed themselves one by one to their Fang Tekeli-li, granting him sustenance to live through the winter.</p>
<p>To the goddess Auril , Tekeli-li's ravenous hunger represented the unending "consumption" of winter. Auril interred the vampiric gnoll within the Caves of Hunger , imprisoning him in the ice of the Reghed Glacier as the passageway out froze over. He remained trapped there for over a century until a group of adventurers re-opened the passageway.</p>
