<p>The Dolphin language was the language spoken by dolphins , a highly intelligent aquatic species of mammal that inhabited the oceans of Toril .</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p>Beyond dolphins themselves, the Dolphin was commonly known in the oceans of Zakhara by the pahari . It was also a common secondary language among aquarians and sea druids , two types of specialty priests in the Church of Deep Sashelas . Though of the two, it was the aquarians who specialized in the language.</p>
<h2>Phonology</h2>
<p>The dolphin language consisted of a series of clicks, squeals, and whistles. Some described it as melodious.</p>
<p>Much like whalesong , the language spoken by Toril's whales , the dolphin language was a pure-sound language. This was in contrast to the many languages based around verbal speech that were employed by humans , demihumans , and humanoids . It was considered to be rather difficult for other creatures to fully emulate their language —especially surface dwellers, who lacked the enhanced auditory and vocal capabilities of dolphins and whales. This higher degree of sound also made the language undetectable by humans.</p>
<h2>Derivative Languages</h2>
<p>Serusan , a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Serôs , featured elements of both the dolphin language and aquatic elvish . The latter was not only noted for being somewhat akin to dolphin language, but many aquatic elvish poems and songs were said to mimic it in sound.</p>
