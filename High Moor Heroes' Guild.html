<p>The High Moor Heroes' Guild was a guild of adventurers based in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands around 1358 DR .</p>
<p>The closest thing to a rogue's guild permitted by the High Rider, Lord Dhelt , it was a legal outlet for the poor, desperate, unruly, maladjusted, or just violent people of the city.</p>
<p>This adventuring band made regular expeditions onto the High Moor , "scouring" whatever they found. Guild members also tutored each other and other adventurers for a fee, with a discount for members.</p>
