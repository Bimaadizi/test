<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Cult of the Absolute menaced the city of Baldur's Gate, Dharin Brislen attempted to ship his wife and daughters away from Baldur's Gate. He attempted to negotiate a passage to Waterdeep with Captain Sleam, a smuggler with her own boat and crew. But Sleam asked for too much money, claiming it was a life and death situation for her crew too. Dharin could not afford to pay for four seats so he resorted to staying behind. It was unknown if the family and Sleam's boat escaped the Gate before the battle of the Upper City commenced.</p>
