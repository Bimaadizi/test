<p>The Miners' League was a prominent guild of miners and ore extractors based in the Eileanar enclave during ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The guild was owned by the arcanist Gneissenau , with the assistance of several managers. Philo and Lebreton managed the Delver's Consortium that made up the guild's 300 miners, Jackson oversaw the extraction of metals, while Wackernagel and Ochsenbein handled the various arcanists and seers who divined the locations of rich metal deposits around the world.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The League specialized in the mining and extraction of gold . A great breakthrough came about in 3515 NY (−344 DR) when Gneissenau developed a surprisingly simple process that allowed for completely pure gold to be extracted from ore, using only mercury and portals to the planes of Fire , Vacuum , and Ice . This allowed them to produce pure gold in a consistent and relatively cheap manner.</p>
