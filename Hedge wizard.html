<p>Hedge wizard (also seen as hedge-wizard ) was a title given to certain spellcasters. Other forms of this appellation were hedge-witch , hedge-priest , and hedge-row sage .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A hedge wizard was basically a self-taught spellcaster that could perform cantrips , make basic potions , and scribe simple scrolls . Other skills they often found useful for generating income were herbalism, minor medical procedures (splinting a broken limb, disinfecting wounds, making healing salves), and feats of sleight-of-hand for entertainment.</p>
<p>Hedge mages that trained as such learned herbalism and how to put together somewhat effective antidotes, and they learned the brewing of potions sooner than other wizards; they often abandoned the practice of transmutation and invocation spells, and either necromancy or illusion , with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Other hedge mages were simply wizards of more traditional disciplines, who had chosen a life without adventure. Such hedge wizards lived mostly in cities, with one out of every ten living outside the city either after retirement or after being kicked out. Their most important skill was their ability to refer a customer to another hedge wizard they knew of, who specialized in the desired service. Not all so-called hedge wizards were wizards, however, with some of them using magical items to perform services, and even some priests of Azuth , Chauntea , Deneir , and Mielikki , Mystra , Oghma and Sel√ªne filling a similar role in small chapels outside cities. Some others were trained martially and some lacked all magical skill, focusing instead on the alchemical and sagely aspects of the job. Finally, a few were simply utter charlatans.</p>
<p>Some hedge wizards were in fact elven high magi in disguise from the island of Evermeet .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Hedge wizards often worked by sharing information between adventurers, helping coordinate their efforts by keeping track of who was out of town, and who was free to go on a quest. They also helped form parties of adventurers. Some traded in enchanted baubles, which carried lesser effects not useful in combat; most traded in herbal or alchemical mixtures. Rarely, they could carry actual lesser magical items. The ones that cast spells generally were capable of casting at most those as complex as dispel magic , or even remove curse in some cases.</p>
<p>Sometimes a hedge wizard would be looked to for leadership in small, rural communities, and some reached a respectable level of skill in the Art , but city folk often dismissed them as bumpkins and charlatans. Hedge wizards lived modestly (and usually alone), either by choice or because magical research was expensive and explosive. Educated spellcasters often viewed them with disdain.</p>
