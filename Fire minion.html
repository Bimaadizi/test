<p>Fire minions were fearsome creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire , some of whom had migrated to the sun in Realmspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Standing some 7 feet (2.1 meters) tall, their bodies seemed to be made entirely of fire, constantly swirling and flickering with living light. They could assume any form they wanted but the most common preferred form was that of a humanoid with fangs and horns.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Fire minions would fight by rising out of the fiery ground, taking their forms in the process. This meant that they seldom actually took their foes by surprise, but did make for a more elegant entrance, which apparently was more important for the fire minions themselves. In battle, the fire minions could use the selfsame ability to retreat underground and either reappear somewhere more advantageous or flee from the combat entirely.</p>
<p>The weapon of choice for most fire minions was a large two-handed sword , which they used alongside their constant flame aura that burnt everyone not immune to fire within 5 feet (1.5 meters). As they themselves were made from seemingly living flame, they were immune to all fire-based attacks, and magical flames such as fireballs or even dragon breath would heal them rather than hurt them. With such fury did their fire burn that even water-based attacks would nearly be turned away. Only cold magics could truly hurt them, and seriously, as their fiery bodies and their very lives would quickly be extinguished.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Fire, flame, and lava were the natural homes of fire minions, who traveled through these materials as easily as walking. However they had only a limited ability to leave those environs and to leave the flames came with a risk of injury or even death. If they did not return to a place of fire and flame after 6 hours, their flame aura would disappear and their bodies started breaking down, until they either returned to flames or they perished as dry burnt-out husks evaporating in clouds of ash.</p>
<p>Little was known about the normal lives of fire minions, as they were not a society open to outsiders, except that they came from the Plane of Fire and were considered free-willed fire elementals by almost all sages. They had a limited ability to gate themselves to the Prime Material plane , but only in areas of the most intense flames, like those found in the calderas of volcanoes, or on the surface of the sun. As such, they were only encountered in the most exotic of locales.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Groups of fire minions were observed to live on the surface of the sun, but due to the properties of that surface had never been contacted by any humans or demihumans .</p>
