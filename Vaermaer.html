<p>Vaermaer was one of the four bartenders who also worked as bouncers of the Copper Coronet in the River District of Athkatla , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vaermaer was a giant muscled and balding man who worked wearing his breastplate , greaves , and armored codpiece . He wore many earrings. Judging by his posturing and physique, Vaermaer was a seasoned fighter . His professional surliness veiled Vaermaer's true personality.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR, Vaermaer was an established member of the Copper Coronet's staff. He, along with Bordovan , Delric , and Othlo , was supervised by Old Sarvo Droostan , the Coronet's tavernmaster. Vaermaer worked in full armor and was proficient in stopping trouble, fighting off rowdy drunkards, spotting drunk spell-casting, and faked intoxication. Vaermaer and the rest of the mountainous bartenders kept large human fist-sized rocks behind the Copper Coronet's bar stand. These rocks were used as projectiles, tossed around with immaculate precision at drunken troublemakers. Vaermaer's attitude changed to that of a glacier when an obviously rich visitor arrived a the Coronet or one of Athkatla's officials. He did not tolerate patrons harassing the Copper Coronet's female employees.</p>
