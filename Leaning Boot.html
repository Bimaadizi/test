<p>The Leaning Boot was an especially poor-quality tavern found in the city of Mulmaster , that defied the odds by remaining in business for well over a century's time.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It could be found within the Docks Quarter of the city.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Leaning Boot was found within the basement of dockside house, accessible by a set of rickety stairs. With no other identifiable markers, the entrance could be found by the old, salt -worn boot that had been nailed to a wooden post. The building above was an apartment building.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The inn offered its patrons the unique ambiance that arose from the combination of discreet conversation; the aromatic bouquet of salt water, stale ale , and sea-battered wood, as well the ever-present threat of being stabbed in the arm.</p>
