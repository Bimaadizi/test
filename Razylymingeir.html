<p>Razylymingeir , better known as Steelheart , was a female steel dragon active in Vaasa as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . She spent much of her time in the form of a human , and used the name Katelyn Brekstel .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her true form, Razylymingeir had grayish-blue scales. In her human form, she adopted the appearance of a conventionally attractive human girl with blonde hair, light grey eyes, tan skin, and a few small moles on her jaw. When she was a juvenile , this human form was about 5 feet (150 centimeters) tall and appeared to be a teenager of 12–14 years old.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Razylymingeir was brave and prone to emotion, likely to burst into tears when sad and to seek furious revenge when aggrieved.</p>
<p>She was fascinated by humans and by human bravery in particular, and she enjoyed traveling with humanoid companions. However, she was prone to lie to humanoids in order to protect her identity or to get them to assist her. She would seek out heroic types when she needed aid, and was also prone to goad them into dangerous situations with tearful pleas or by appealing to their courage and pride. If these companions deduced her true nature, she was polite and apologetic as she attempted to explain her actions.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a steel dragon, Razylymingeir could breathe a cloud of poison gas. She could also freely polymorph herself, and preferred the forms of small animals—such as mice , cats , birds , or snakes —in order to move about undetected. She was also known to adopt other forms during battle—such as a tiger —depending on the situation or space constraints.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Razylymingeir lived in the town of Darmshall , from where she kept a watchful eye on the evil of Castle Perilous . She kept her nature as a dragon hidden, and lived outwardly as "Katelyn Brekstel". She would prepare stories to explain away any incidents in which she appeared to display unusual or supernatural competence, and would use her control over her polymorphed form to produce fake evidence of hardship to support her tales. For example, if she flew somewhere and was questioned about how she had traveled to her destination so quickly, she might claim to have barely slept while on the road and then show her apparently blistered feet to corroborate.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Razylymingeir opposed the Cult of the Dragon .</p>
<p>Her parents were the steel dragons Forge and Glimmerfang . Prior to their deaths, the three dragons lived together in human form in Darmshall, where Forge held the identity "Jarl Brekstel" and served as the town blacksmith while Glimmerfang held the identity "Ingrid Brekstel".</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Razylymingeir was hatched circa the Year of the Behir, 1342 DR , and from a young age, her parents instilled in her two things: an appreciation and awe for the bravery and willingness of humanoids to take on impossible odds, and that she was never to assume her true form in front of a humanoid except in an absolute emergency. The family of steel dragons thus outwardly lived in Darmshall as if Razylymingeir was the ordinary daughter of an ordinary blacksmith and his wife.</p>
<p>Both of Razylymingeir's parents worked as spies against Zhengyi the Witch-King following his aggression toward Vaasa and Damara in the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR . They helped to oppose the Witch-King in the Bloodstone Wars , and even after his defeat, the pair continued to keep an eye on his ruined citadel at Castle Perilous, especially as evil chromatic dragons began nesting in the ruins.</p>
<p>In the summer of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , —when Razylymingeir was a 27 years-old juvenile —her parents attracted the ire of the Cult of the Dragon when they tricked a member into revealing the Cult's plans for an alliance with the Zhentarim and an invasion of Thar . They took their daughter and attempted to leave Vaasa to the west to warn the people of the Moonsea North , but they were intercepted by three red dragons — Flameshoot , Wyndfire , and Snizzler —and a white dragon — Frostnax . Razylymingeir escaped by polymorphing into a mouse, but both of her parents were killed after managing to slay Frostnax and wound Flameshoot. The sight of her badly wounded father and of a red dragon's maw around her mother's neck was the last time she saw her parents alive.</p>
<p>On the verge of despair, Razylymingeir recalled her parents' words about the bravery of humans, and set out to recruit adventurers to help her take revenge on the dragons who slew her parents. Her journey saw her evading capture by the pursuing dragons and once having to resort to her true form to deal with a hungry wolf called One-eye , but she ultimately arrived in Glister . There, she adopted her human guise as "Katelyn Brekstel" and—fearful of revealing her true nature—shared a sob story with a local wizard , Thusk Tharmuil , in which she claimed that her human parents had been kidnapped by dragon-riding bandits in Vaasa, and Thusk agreed to help her find brave heroes willing and able to hunt dragons. Razylymingeir's revenge would take her first to Moortown in Vaasa to hunt down Flameshoot, and then to the Moonsea to intercept Wyndfire and Snizzler as they escorted a delegation of the Cult of the Dragon to a conference with the Zhentarim. Over the course of this adventure, she grew from a dragon who prioritized her own desires over the greater good into one that followed her parents' desire to protect people. With these events behind her, Razylymingeir returned to Darmshall to honor her parents' calling of keeping watch on Castle Perilous.</p>
<p>As of the the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a year after the events of Sammaster's Rage —in which the Cult of the Dragon used the Dracorage mythal to wreck havoc across Faerûn and in the Cold Lands especially —Razylymingeir continued to keep a wary eye on Castle Perilous. By this time, the church of Tiamat had begun creating dragonspawn beneath that ruin.</p>
