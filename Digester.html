<p>Digesters were a ravenous, predatory species of magical beasts .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures stood on average 5 feet (1.5 meters) in height upon two powerful hind legs and weighed around 350 pounds (160 kilograms). Their bodies sported a long tail, had a grey pebbly hide with dagger -like markings that helped them to camouflaged, and overall measured 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length. Their heads were narrow with sucking mouths and sported a tube-like orifice on their forehead.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Digesters had a ravenous appetite, rarely feeling full, but when they were the beasts laid low and tried to avoid other creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Digesters were capable of seeing in both areas of low-light and total darkness . They were also impervious to harm from acid .</p>
<p>These creatures were capable of shooting acid from the tube-like they sported on their foreheads, either spraying it out in a cone of roughly 20 feet (6.1 meters) or as a concentrated stream out to 5 feet (1.5 meters). Once a digester used this function they had to wait some time before they could spray again.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When a digester spotted a likely target they would charge at them and spray their acid. If they found that was not sufficient to kill their prey, a digester would then attack with their hind legs until they were able to use their acid spray once more.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1372 DR , a digester roamed the valley of High Thorog after having been freed from Telkoun's Tower .</p>
<p>A year later, it was found that Quon's shop in Zhentil Keep held a digester in its kennels.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Digesters were typically found to inhabit forests within warm climates.</p>
<p>In the Shining South region of south Faerûn , packs of these creatures inhabited the Lluirwood , the Shaareach Forest , and the northern Mhair Jungles . In interior Faerûn , they could be found in the Vast Swamp .</p>
