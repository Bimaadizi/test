<p>Uton was a crusader of Selûne and a member of the Knights of the Half Moon at the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep in the mid–14th th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One night during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR , while a purported avatar of the goddess resided at the House of the Moon, Uton and a fellow Knight called out Onyx and Timoth as they infiltrated the temple in robes stolen from the Knights standing guard at the entrance. Timoth claimed they were new converts; Uton queried the poor fit of their robes, but Timoth argued fitted robes were in short supply and they made a speedy departure. Uton remained suspicious, and alerted High Priestess Naneatha Suaril . Onyx and Timoth were caught and divested of their robes, and Naneatha left hell hounds to deal with them instead.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Uton was a pale-skinned man with a shaven head and a silver crescent moon on his forehead, which was the mark of his order.</p>
