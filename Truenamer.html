<p>Truenamers were students of truespeak , a language that they believed to undergirt all of creation. By speaking aloud utterances in the language, they were capable of effecting magical changes in the world around them.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Most truenamers worshipped Deneir , and saw truenames as related to his Metatext . Other truenamers also worshipped Mystra , Oghma , Lathander , Azuth , or Gond ; others favored Selûne or Shar , due to their connection to mythological cosmogony. The deities of the races of Faerûn also saw a number of truenamer worshippers. A number of truenamers were part of study groups on truespeak ; the most significant of these groups was the House of the Unnamed , in Velprintalar .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Utterances were central to the abilities of all truenamers; they generally started with the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, only mastering the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool after some development, and learning from the Lexicon of the Perfected Map after maturing in their craft. All truenamers knew from the beginning their own personal true name ; those whose craft was mature invariably knew one or more recitations, utterances constructed around their personal truenames. Truenamers learned how to research true names more efficiently along the way to fully maturing their craft, and their focused search for knowledge rendered most of them quite skilled in more than one field of lore.</p>
<p>After their craft was mature, truenamers gained a number of other abilities: they began with the ability to achieve an effect akin to scrying on any creature with a true name they were aware of; then, an effect akin to sending , allowing them to converse with them. Truenamers nearing the pinnacle of their craft were capable of using truespeak to target more than one creature at a time with utterances from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind. The final pinnacle of their abilities was the development of a word that granted them the ability to teleport themselves to wherever it was spoken.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Truenamers were largely seen the same as wizards , as to most people in Faerûn , the difference was largely an internal matter: both gained magical power through study. Wizards appreciated truenamers, and vice versa.</p>
