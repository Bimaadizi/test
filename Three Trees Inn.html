<p>The Three Trees Inn was an inn that stood in the center of the town of Nonthal in Turmish and was the busiest establishment in town.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The main source of entertainment and the famed feature that attracted clients to the Three Trees Inn was a small path behind its building. The path was a dangerous and enchanted way known as Nonthal's Path that led towards the infamous and magically hidden Nonthal's Hold . The path led to a simple dung -pit to an unwitting observer, but it was just a clever disguise. Mysterious wizard Nonthal hid his lair behind a trapped path, each third set of which was one of the 13 Gates of Magic . Each of the thirteen teleported travelers across Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Countless adventurers paid for lodgings at the inn and tested their luck walking Nonthal's Path. Even more inn customers stayed there and watched the adventurers trying to get to the fabled magical treasure, gambling on adventures' fates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nonthal's Hold was created sometime circa 1170 DR and quickly gained popularity among fortune seekers. A map that detailed the whereabouts of Nonthal's magical treasure was left behind and later was proudly displayed in the Three Trees Inn to inspire more unwitting adventurers to walk through the 13 Gates of Magic .</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the entire inn was rebuilt to better feature the view of Nonthal's Path and all those trying their luck. Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , one of the adventures who tried his luck and failed was a wizard named Fern . After his failed attempt, he found his way back to the Three Trees Inn and observed others attempting the feat.</p>
