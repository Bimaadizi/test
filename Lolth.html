<p>Lolth ( pronounced : / l ɑː l θ / lalth or : / l oʊ l θ / lolth or : / l oʊ ɑː l θ / loalth ), or Lloth , known as the Queen of Spiders as well as the Queen of the Demonweb Pits , was the most influential goddess of the drow , within the pantheon of the Dark Seldarine .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lolth could appear either as a 12 feet (3.7 meters) diameter, crimson-eyed black widow spider , or a 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall, beautiful female drow often garbed entirely in clinging spiders or sometimes in artful, drow chainmail dresses or tunics. The form most commonly found in the Abyss however, thought to be her true form, was a combination of the others, a giant spider with the head of a coldly beautiful female drow.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lolth was a goddess of cold cruelty not out of place in the darkest depths of the endless Abyss, reveling in betrayal and bloodshed and toying with everyone from her minions to her victims. She not only enjoyed, but thrived upon torture, destruction, and death, whether personally performing it or causing it. Every interaction was ultimately done with malice, ill will seething from her every move, and even those who knew her well could be surprised by just how deep her viciousness went. Her malevolence could be compared to the rage of the brutal orc deity Gruumsh , but where his fury was as mindlessly violent as a force of nature, her malice was complicated and deliberate. Furthermore, Gruumsh could at least be said to be steady and constant in his hate, whilst Lolth's was utterly capricious.</p>
<p>Lolth demanded absolute fealty and obedience from all drow, and questioning her motives or wisdom was considered a sin. This applied even to male drow despite her considering them to be unclean, and she took vengeful notice if one abandoned her faith. She also secretly desired the worship of other types of elves, as well as humans , and enjoyed corrupting them into her service even more than torment and devastation. In contrast, she fomented unending chaos amongst the drow, eternally setting them against each other. Ostensibly this was to weed out the weak and complacent, leaving only the strongest, cruelest, and most devious to serve her, and to some degree she believed this, but it was also simply for her own amusement and supremacy.</p>
<p>Despite her demands for loyalty, those who blindly obeyed Lolth's demands would find themselves quickly led to their deaths. In truth, Lolth's capricious nature meant that there were few hard-and-fast rules, and much uncertainty as to her desires. The successful had to pay attention to her ever-changing wants, for her favor was fickle, and those who she played favorites with (a frequent occurrence) would inevitably find her turning on them without warning. The Spider Queen was technically capable of displays of kindness and aiding those she fancied, and would always give one chance for the disfavored to redeem themselves, but this usually meant a dangerous mission and in others might just mean silently watching their next move. She could never be relied on and her ultimate motivation was almost always manipulative.</p>
<p>Lolth's promotion of infighting amongst her worshipers led many to believe she was insane, and this assessment was not baseless. Indeed, ever since her fall from grace her sanity had frayed and fractured until she became the petty, conniving monster she was commonly known as. Her will was not merely fluid, but often times contradictory, although even if she was mad, the drow placed more importance on a deep and devious sense of cunning than mental stability. Ironically, for all her demands for obedience, nothing demanded her attention and admiration more than treachery, even towards herself (if only temporarily). Guile and political ruthlessness were the signs of her favorite servants, and she ultimately admired ambition more than she did loyalty.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Lolth could readily transform at will between her drow, drider, and giant spider forms, with some sources claiming that certain powers of hers were tied to specific forms, but during the transformation process she could not utilize any of her spell-like powers. She was capable of moving between places almost instantaneously, by means of being able to cast plane shift , teleport without error , and dimension door at will. She could also communicate telepathically, out to a range of 90 feet (27 meters).</p>
<p>At will Lolth could cast comprehend languages , confusion , darkness, 15' radius , dispel magic , summon spiders , tongues , true seeing , charm arachnid , and detect thoughts (though was only able to target drow with it). When she used summon spiders it could conjure forth around nine to sixteen large spiders , seven to twelve huge spiders , two to eight giant spiders , and/or one to four phase spiders .</p>
<p>Once per day each, Lolth could use the spell-like powers change self , clairvoyance , domination , Evard's black tentacles , and mind blank . Derived from her divine domains , Lolth had the power to cast command plants , rebuke plants , and smite fifteen times per day.</p>
<p>Lolth's others spell-like abilities that were neither tied to a specific form nor limited to a certain number per day were as followed:</p>
<p>She could also cast a number of divine and arcane spells, though only while in her drow form. While she typically drew from the chaos and evil domains for her divine spells, she was said to be capable of drawing from any sphere or school of magic . While in her drow form, Lolth had access to the innate drow abilities dancing light , darkness , and faerie fire , and she could enact an effect similar to charm person upon a human or demihuman by physically embracing them.</p>
<p>Prior to the Time of Troubles , her spider form was said to be capable of gating in one or two vrock , hezrou , or glabrezu to aid her, and had access to all psionic attack and defense modes, as well as a number of disciplines and major sciences. These included body equilibrium , clairvoyance , dimension walking , domination , mind bar , molecular rearranagement , and probability travel . Beyond these powers, her spider form was noted for its poisonous bite and ability to produce webs from its abdominal spinnerets, equivalent to the web spell. Some claimed this was limited to eight times per day. She could spin her spinnerets around to fire webbing in any direction. She could produce these webs in the form of nets or sheets of webbing, that were 30​ to ​60 feet (9.1​ to ​18 meters) in length. All webs produced by her were toxic to all but Lolth and spiders due to a poisonous excretion upon the strands.</p>
<p>She could not be harmed by weapons that weren't magical, specifically of a +2 or greater enchantment, and was resistant to harm from fire . Once believed to be wholly vulnerable to acid and all manner of poisons , it was later determined that she was wholly immune to both. Sources also differed on whether she was merely resistant to harm from cold and electrical-based attacks, or immune to them. She was additionally immune to diseases , death magic effects, being paralyzed, being disintegrated, transmutation spells, mind-affecting effects, and the spells banishment , energy drain , and imprisonment The one Lolth was especially susceptible to was holy water .</p>
<p>In any form she took, all of Lolth's senses operated outward at a distance of 15 miles (24 kilometers). Her vision could even penetrate the haze of magical darkness. In addition to the normal vision and darkvision of drow, she could perceive the world through ultravision . Unlike drow, she was neither harmed nor discomforted by light. And like many other deities, she could perceive anything within 15 mi (24 km) of her worshipers, holy sites, sacred objects, and location where her name or one of her many titles had been spoken in the past hour.</p>
<p>Lastly, Lolth was capable of creating magic items that generated darkness, provided divination, or granted the user a disguise. Some examples of these included a wand of deeper darkness , a crystal ball , or a hat of disguise . She could also create magical items from simple weapons, martial weapons, and light or medium armor . She customarily left a magical item with the poisonous spiders she left to aid, guard, or watch over those who served here.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lolth disdained planar beings less powerful than herself, viewing them as either pawns or foes. At the same time, she held those more powerful than herself in contempt, coveting the status of the most powerful beings and seeking to ascend to their station through deception, betrayal, and murder.</p>
<h3>The Dark Seldarine</h3>
<p>Lolth was the leader of the Dark Seldarine , but was opposed to varying degrees by all other members of it. She was the mother of both Eilistraee and Vhaeraun , along with Vandria , though the latter never supported the acts of her mother or joined the Dark Seldarine.</p>
<p>On one hand, Lolth encouraged her son's rivalry with her, for it appealed to her love of chaos. On the other hand, her son's successes at swaying the drow to his cause of destroying her, her followers, and her version of society, led her to consider him a threat. He amassed the second largest following among drow overall (the largest on the surface), and was an ever expanding force, to the point that Lolth considered Vhaeraun her real enemy and rival.</p>
<p>The two had no common ground: Lolth promoted favoritism towards females, while Vhaeraun promoted gender equality; the Spider Queen wanted surface elves to be sacrificed by her worshipers, while the Masked Lord urged his followers to cooperate with surface elves; Lolth ordered her followers to keep drow society stagnant in every regard, while Vhaeraun attracted those who wanted change in their societal progress, economic growth, and territorial expansion; and Lolth wanted to extinguish the drow race's desire to return to the surface, while Vhaeraun encouraged settling the surface.</p>
<p>Vhaeraun's masked traitors , clerical spies Lolth had mistakenly believed members of her own clergy, were enough of a problem that she considered their discovery, and warning her clergy of their existence, worthy of her personal attention. Indeed, Lolth, who normally gave worshipers of other drow gods a second chance on being found out, made an exception for Vhaeraun's followers, who were killed right away.</p>
<p>The other members of the Dark Seldarine were generally of minor importance and Lolth's behavior towards them could be described as derisive.</p>
<p>She considered her daughter Eilistraee to be an inconsequential fool, a moody girl who could be easily manipulated into serving her ends. The epithet used by Eilistraee's followers' to describe Lolth was "the Tyrant Poisoner".</p>
<p>Ghaunadaur was a different matter. She feared the possibility that he could sway the drow towards his cause, but he did not care enough for drow matters to attract many of them.</p>
<p>Kiaransalee and Selvetarm were her allies (and the only ones in the drow pantheon), who acted as her servants. The former was forced into subservience due to the power gap between her and Lolth, but she gained a degree of freedom after she killed Orcus and took Thanatos , the demon lord 's realm. The latter was Lolth's grandchild and her (self-appointed) champion. Selvetarm was practically enslaved to her, but was quite comfortable under her rule, enough to botch his chance at gaining freedom when his father, Vhaeraun, was about to kill Lolth.</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Lolth was an enemy of the Seldarine , especially of Corellon Larethian , her former husband, Sehanine Moonbow , for the part she played in foiling her scheme to overthrow Corellon, and Fenmarel Mestarine , who was her partner in adultery but ultimately did not join her betrayal. While her hatred was deep, she did not actually put any significant effort into acting on it, preferring to keep the drow engaged in deep infighting, rather than united against those whom she considered her enemies.</p>
<p>She once helped Gruumsh to attempt to kill Corellon Larethian , but after he failed, they later became enemies. She also was the enemy of a long list of Underdark deities.</p>
<p>Lolth had occasional alliances with Loviatar and Malar . Some believed there may have been an ancient pact between Lolth and the duergar deity Laduguer , due to his race's use of steeders and her having never been known to use them as minions.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Lolth's follower base was varied. It mainly consisted of drow , but also included aranea , chitine , draegloths and deep dragons . She gained a few elven followers, and tried to gain more worshipers by assuming the aspect of Moander , a deity of rot.</p>
<p>Lolth drove her worshipers into heavy infighting under the pretense of culling the weak, while her actual goals were to hold absolute control over the dark elves , prevent the rise of alternative faiths or ideas, and avoid complacency (even though she found amusement in the strife that plagued her followers' communities). However, in the long run, her influence proved to be an obstacle to the growth and success of her drow followers, preventing them from unifying against common enemies or for a common cause.</p>
<p>Any attempt by the drow to emulate Lolth was doomed to fail, for unlike other humanoids, their arachnid deity was without their form or psychology. They were ashamed that they could not fully live up to her demands, and in truth, the Spider Queen was one they could never truly please. Any boon she granted to them was only in service to escalating conflict and causing further strife, and in the end, she cared nothing for them.</p>
<h3>Clerics</h3>
<p>Lolth's clerics were almost exclusively female (although there were a few males). They represented the rulers of most Lolthite communities, and strictly followed the Spider Queen's will, forcing the drow into extreme subservience to their deity, and into the constant state of conflict that dominated their lives. Each priestess strove for the favor of the Spider Queen and was ready to do anything in order to gain status in her goddess' eyes. Her clergy sacrificed the living and treasure for her glory. Their vestments were normally adorned with spider motifs. Her rituals required them to wear darker clothes or none at all.</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>The Militant Myrlochar , sometimes known as the Order of Soul Spiders, was an elite fighting organization composed exclusively of male crusaders , and found in the dark elven cities where Lolth was worshiped and males were allowed entrance into her priesthood. They directly served the reigning Matron Mothers of the city and were employed to kill their targets. They were usually used without pause until they got killed.</p>
<p>The Handmaidens of the Spider Queen were an order of female crusaders. Also called the "Daughters of the Yochlol ", they had no ties to specific cities, and were used when Lolth wanted an entire city brought back into line. At least three times in recorded history did the Handmaidens of the Spider Queen destroy entire drow cities to prevent them from straying too far from Lolth. One of their usual tasks was to terrorize merchants who took Vhaeraun as their patron, as well as settlements run by the followers of Vhaeraun or Ghaunadaur 's (or where those faiths were prominent).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Dawn Age</h3>
<p>Before her fall, Lolth was known as Araushnee, the lesser elven goddess of destiny and artisans. She was consort to Corellon, leader of all the elf deities, and ruled with him and Sehanine as the indisputable heads of their pantheon. Unflinching as the fallen night, she too had played a part in the creation of the earliest elves; her cutting jests brought forth tears of laughter from Corellon from which mortal fey were spawned, as did Sehanine's arcing acrobatics. Sometimes the laughter between the three was dark and mocking, but more often, it was true and heartfelt.</p>
<p>Araushnee would become the main goddess of the dark elves, whose nightly complexion matched her own, and have twins with Corellon, Vhaeraun (the elder) and Eilistraee (the younger), as well as a third child, Vandria Gilmadrith .</p>
<p>The events regarding Lolth's rebellion were lost to time and the timelessness of the Feywild , and too distorted by shadows and echoes for anyone to be sure of her first betrayal. Not even the likes of Sehanine or Corellon could say if she had always thought differently to them, or if there had been some kind of inciting incident. Some divinations suggest the troubles dated back to before Arvandor was even complete, when the orc god Gruumsh , Corellon's long-standing rival, tried to destroy it. Though she respected his wish to face Gruumsh alone, she secretly admired his rage, and at some point dallied with him. The passions of her soul would grow darker to the point she even consorted with the lords of the Abyss, but though they aided her corruption, they were not responsible for her fall from grace.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason or chronology, Araushnee grew jealous of her husband and discontent with her station. Corellon would give her almost anything she asked, but her desire was power that could only be taken, and her ambition was to rule all the Seldarine. Slowly, over the course of her treachery, her connection to the elves would weaken.</p>
<p>During her first attempt, she aided Gruumsh in trying to kill her husband by imbuing the scabbard that he had crafted for his sword with magic that would cause the weapon to shatter during the fight. However, this plan failed due to Sehanine Moonbow 's interfering with it: she knew that Araushnee had tampered with the scabbard, because the Weaver had conducted this very first step of her betrayal during the night, when Sehanine's sight could reach her.</p>
<p>Later, Araushnee agitated Malar into attacking the wounded Corellon after she witnessed the Beastlord killing the orc god Herne on Faerûn , but even that failed, as the elven lord managed to chase his aggressor away.</p>
<p>Araushnee's next move was to gather a host of gods on hostile footing with the Seldarine, forming an army to assault Arvandor and overthrow Corellon. The army itself was so badly organized, that she was confident that they would fail. Her true plan was to give the cursed scabbard back to Corellon, as during the battle that would later unfold, the item would cause arrows shot by Eilistraee to hit his chest instead. According to Lolth's plan, that would have killed Corellon while turning her daughter into a scapegoat.</p>
<p>Before the attack by the anti-Seldarine faction was ready, Sehanine confronted Araushnee about her betrayal (as mentioned above, she knew Araushnee to be a traitor), but Araushnee struck first and imprisoned her with the help of her son Vhaeraun. Together, they also made sure that Eilistraee would find and deliver the scabbard to Corellon, and that she would be in his vicinity during the battle.</p>
<p>Once the battle started, the Weaver's plan almost went as she expected, supported even further by Ghaunadaur 's entrance. When an ogre god charged Corellon, who had been immobilized by the Elder Eye, Eilistraee swiftly fired a few arrows to save her father, but the scabbard drew the projectiles towards the Protector instead, nearly slaying him. Despite all, the anti-Seldarine army lost and retreated as expected, and after the battle Araushnee tried to finish Corellon with a dose of poison crafted by Eilistraee to aid her followers in the hunt, pretending it to be water from Elysium with healing qualities gathered by her daughter. However her plan ultimately failed due to Sehanine's intervention, as the Lady of Dreams had managed to break out from Vhaeraun's prison, albeit at immense cost to herself. Sehanine, Aerdrie Faenya , and Hanali Celanil joined into the triune goddess Angharradh , and used their combined magic to save Corellon's life.</p>
<p>When the elven lord awakened, a trial was called in. Vhaeraun and Eilistraee became members in exile of the Seldarine — willingly in the case of Eilistraee, as she had foreseen that the dark elves would have needed her light and hope in the future. Araushnee meanwhile was stripped of all but a sliver of her divinity and transformed into a tanar'ri with the form of a giant spider. Corellon could not bring himself to destroy her, and instead banished her to the Abyss, bidding her to join the demons she had come to resemble. Furious for her defeat, she made one last attempt on her lover's life, but was thwarted and bested by her husband. Despite all, the Protector still loved her and still could not bring himself to finish her off, allowing her to escape into the opened portal into the realm of demons.</p>
<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<p>After her exile, Araushnee took the name "Lolth". She conquered the 66th layer of the Abyss , the Demonweb Pits , for herself. Lolth was initially opposed by Kiaransalee , an elven goddess whom she swiftly subjugated, and Ghaunadaur, with whom she had a longer conflict. That Which Lurks tried to subsume her, but failed, and in his rage robbed his followers of their intellect. It also downsized his follower base and his power with it, thus allowing Lolth to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>After securing control over her layer, she plotted to exact vengeance against Corellon. Being unable to directly strike at him, she planned to be worshiped as a goddess by the elves, bringing misery to them and therefore to their "father". When the moon elf Kethryllia Amarillis came to retrieve her lover in the Abyss during a battle for the city of Sharlarion , Lolth became interested in the world the elf came from, Toril . She sensed the presence of Vhaeraun , at that time the major deity in Ilythiir , and her attention was drawn there. Her fascination grew as she witnessed the Ilythiiri, at the time under Ka'Narlist , preparing for war when Kethryllia had unknowingly revealed their position to them. Lolth admired the old mage's craftiness and he became her first worshiper and consort.</p>
<p>Ilythiir, the southern empire, was much to her liking, as it was richer and more cosmopolitan, but mainly because of the fierceness of its people, of their ambitions, and of their ability to act on those.</p>
<h3>First Flowering</h3>
<p>Originally, Ilythiir and the other elven nations were not on openly hostile footing, but Lolth poisoned this relationship by causing wars and strife. This led the elves to decide to create a dark elf-free piece of land. They caused the First Sundering, which split a region of the continent from the mainland in order to create an island out of it, a process which caused countless victims, a large part of the church of Vhaeraun among them. Vhaeraun's efforts to remedy this were undermined by the ongoing conflict between him and Eilistraee, granting Lolth and Ghaunadaur the opportunity to fill the void. The Spider Queen then started her machinations that would eventually lead to the Crown Wars.</p>
<p>One legend of the half-elven Crinti of the Shining South told a story of the Ilythiiri wizard whose name was lost to time. She was only known as the Spider Queen . According to the legend, the wizard stumbled across the veil and into the realm of the Unseelie Court where she learned their dark fey magics by unfortunate firsthand experiences. She was imprisoned and tormented but serendipitously escaped the fey realm. The Spider Queen was believed to have been driven insane by the fell magics but gained unimaginable power, becoming the most powerful spell-caster in Ilythiir. Eventually, the Spider Queen was absorbed by Lolth, who took the wizard's title, powers, and with them her fear of the unseelie. Lolth ended up passing that compulsory fear of the unseelie music onto her drow children and subsequently onto the Crinti half-elves. This lore was preserved within the tomes found in libraries of Halruaa .</p>
<h3>Crown Wars</h3>
<p>For Lolth, the Crown Wars were an opportunity to gain control over the dark elves and at the same time exact vengeance against the Seldarine.</p>
<p>Lolth's church grew in prominence during the Second Crown War. At that time, Aryvandaar , the sun elf nation, had started a military campaign against dark elves of Miyeritar (which would later culminate in the genocidal Dark Disaster ). Both to avenge their Miyearitari cousins, and in fear that Aryvandaar could similarly lay waste on Ilythiir, the Ilythiiri joined the conflict against the elven empire. The Ilythiiri coronal summoned Wendonai , a balor in service of Lolth, and bought power from it. Lolth swiftly acted, using this golden opportunity to get the dark elves under her control.</p>
<p>Other noble families of Ilythiir followed their royalty's example, summoning further demonic allies sent by Vhaeraun, Kiaransalee and Ghaunadaur, which gained them influence as well, but not as much as Lolth was acquiring with Wendonai tainting the noble bloodlines of the nation.</p>
<p>At that time, the Ilythiiri were still refining their worship. They knew that Lolth was a spider deity, and that the other five gods and goddesses, who would later become known as the Dark Seldarine , (with the exception of Selvetarm , who was not born yet) were in some kind of relationship. They did not however understand the relationships among them. The Ilythiiri thus experimented with the iconography of these gods, depicting them as spider deities too. These efforts to put the drow deities in this relation in each other were considered so offensive by the depicted, that Lolth, Vhaeraun, Ghaundaur and Kiaransalee killed their high priests for it.</p>
<p>During the Fourth Crown War, the elves' wish for divine salvation, the worship of Lolth who was starting to spread among the Ilythiiri, and the taint of Wendonai which had corrupted their leaders, caused the elves to gather at the Elven Court and summon the power of the Seldarine to curse the dark elves and turn them into drow (even innocent ones and the followers of Eilistraee, who had already been exterminated by the Aryvandaari). The combined forces of the remaining elven nations then violently chased the newly formed race underground.</p>
<h3>Era of Upheaval</h3>
<p>Once in the Underdark , the drow lived in a borderline animal state. With Eilistraee's power nearly collapsed due to the loss of so many of her people, and with Vhaeraun's, Kiaransalee's and Ghaunadaur's power being unable to compete with Lolth's, she became the main drow deity. She gathered them together and urged them into the foundation of their first city, Telantiwar . It later destroyed itself through infighting, causing the drow to spread throughout the Underdark.</p>
<p>A thorn in her side was a demon lord called Zanassu , who claimed dominion over spiders. Lolth got rid of him by using Selvetarm, her grandchild who was born from Vhaeraun and Zandilar when the Spider Queen's followers attacked the Yuirwood . Lolth convinced Selvetarm that killing the demon would have made Eilistraee, whom had befriended him and whom he had come to admire, happy. To that end he fought and defeated Zanassu, but ended up absorbing his power and being bound to Lolth's will in the process. Lolth thus solved two problems: one of her rivals was gone, and her daughter was prevented from getting an ally.</p>
<h3>Time of Troubles</h3>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , apart from appearing in Menzoberranzan and assuming the aspect of Moander to attract more surface elves, humans , and half-elves , Lolth spread information on Zinzerena , a goddess from another world. When she appeared on Toril , Lolth killed her, gaining the portfolios of chaos and assassination, and learning how the distribution and absorption of divine energy worked under Ao 's new rules.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Lolth guided one of her High Priestesses, Azurna in search of the Flame Sword of Lolth to establishing a presence in Undermountain . The Flame Sword was a powerful artifact created by the Queen of Spiders during the War of the Seldarine . The sword held immense power and was able to cut through the Planes. Upon her defeat, the elven gods took the sword, and eventually, it was hidden within Undermountain by Halaster Blackcloak . In 1370 DR , Azurna successfully assembled the spider statue that blocked the vault of the sword, allowing Lolth to manifest her giant drider avatar and tried to reclaim the item. She was confronted by an adventurer agent of Khelben Arunsun , and the avatar was defeated. In the subsequent release of divine energy, Flame Sword of Lolth disappeared, slipping from the goddess' grasp once again.</p>
<h3>War of the Spider Queen</h3>
<p>The War of the Spider Queen was a period during which Lolth transformed herself into a greater deity , turned the Demonweb Pits into an independent plane.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , Lolth suddenly became silent, starting an event know as " Silence of Lolth ". She became completely inactive and no longer granted spells or communed with her followers.</p>
<p>Vhaeraun took advantage of the situation and tried to assassinate his mother. She was seriously injured, but later saved by Selvetarm.</p>
<p>When she finally awoke in 1373 DR , she called for three candidates to become her Chosen and finalize her transformation: Danifae Yauntyrr , Quenthel Baenre and Halisstra Melarn . The first two came on their own to the Demonweb Pits, the last one was sent by Eilistraee to kill Lolth. However, in the Demonweb Pits, after being defeated by the other two, Halisstra converted back to Lolth.</p>
<p>Out of the three, Danifae was chosen to become part of the Spider Queen, Quenthel was sent back home and Halisstra was made Lolth's Lady Penitent, her Chosen, whose duty was to hunt and kill followers of Eilistraee and Vhaeraun.</p>
<p>In 1375 DR , Lolth convinced Eilistraee to play a game of sava with the players' lives (and therefore the very fate of the drow) at stake. Eilistraee accepted, seeing an opportunity to free the drow from Lolth's web once and for all, despite the great risk she'd be taking. Lolth's strategy involved the employment of only two powerful servants of hers: Halisstra Melarn and Wendonai . Vhaeraun, her son, came up with a new plan to kill her. He wanted to assassinate his sister and unite their churches to increase his power and become strong enough to kill his mother. Halisstra Melarn managed to get her hands on Malvag , the organizer of Vhaeraun's plot. Lolth ordered her Chosen to ensure his survival, and she went as far as reviving him after he was killed by Cavatina Xarann , a priestess of Eilistraee, to ensure that Vhaeraun would have a chance at attacking his sister. When that happened, Eilistraee emerged victorious and took her brother's portfolio and the title of Masked Lady, while Vhaeraun supposedly died.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lolth's Chosen, Halisstra, was sent to the church of Eilistraee to inform them of the whereabouts of the Crescent Blade (which Wendonai had made into a vessel for himself), and to lead Cavatina Xarann to the Demonweb Pits. There the priestess killed Selvetarm with the Crescent Blade. This event later caused his church to be completely absorbed into Lolth's: the Spider Queen claimed that Selvetarm's loss was part of her plan, and Eilistraee too was led to believe it.</p>
<p>When Cavatina returned from the Demonweb, Qilué Veladorn took possession of the Wendonai-possessed Crescent Blade. Qilué recognized an evil presence in the weapon and planned to banish it, but the demon successfully convinced her to not act on it, for it would have destroyed the blade. Wendonai also let himself seemingly be killed by Cavatina, which put the balor above suspicion of other followers of Eilistraee. He would remain at Qilué's side for the next few years, although the High Priestess of Eilistraee also started to hatch a plan to actually kill the balor by taking him into herself and using her Silver Fire to destroy him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kiaransalee joined the game in 1377 DR . The ensuing battle between Eilistraee and the Revenancer resolved in favor of the Dark Maiden: the forces of Eilistraee successfully assaulted the Acropolis of Thanatos , Kiaransalee's main temple, and a ritual cast by Q'arlynd Melarn nearly erased her name from the minds of all living beings on Toril, leading to the goddess' disappaearance. At the same time, Qilué kept fighting against with Wendonai's influence, and his presence could be felt when the Dark Sister ordered the death of the defenseless clerics of the Revenancer in the Acropolis after that goddess' death.</p>
<p>Ghaunadaur joined the conflict in 1378 DR , planning to attack Eilistraee in order to free his avatar trapped under her temple of the Promenade . Qilué agreed to a risky plan to protect the temple from the followers of Ghaunadaur: it failed (intentinally botched by former Vhaeraunites) and the temple was lost. Through its portal network the slime god's followers managed to kill many members of the church of Eilistraee. Lolth also unleashed Halisstra on her daughter's worshipers, inflicting great losses that culminated in the following year.</p>
<p>In fact, in 1379 DR , Eilistraee—while inhabiting the body of Qilué Veladorn—tried to free Halisstra from Lolth's clutches and convince her to kill the Spider Queen. However, Wendonai successfully nudged Halisstra into slaying Qilué and, apparently, the Masked Lady with her. Lolth then left Halisstra to die, because she had exhausted her use as a Chosen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Q'arlynd Melarn's managed to cast a second elven high magic spell, which he had been preparing with Qilué Veladorn. The intent was to turn all drow of the church of Eilistraee into dark elves , but only few hundreds of the few thousands worshipers of Eilistraee (which she had as a lesser deity) were changed. Corellon took the souls of the transformed ones (and only the transformed ones) under his protection and into his portion of Arvandor (even though Eilistraee's realm, which continued existing, already was in Arvandor, and so were the souls of her followers within it). Corellon's servant Solars claimed that, with this act, there was no more need for Eilistraee: to Corellon, all the willing drow had been saved, while the unwilling were cast down and left in Lolth's clutches as a necessary sacrifice.</p>
<p>As her final move, Lolth tried to kill Ghaunadaur. The attempt failed, as the ooze god proved to be stronger than expected.</p>
<h3>Post-Spellplague</h3>
<p>In the following century, Lolth enjoyed a position of supremacy among the drow. She did suffer opposition from the Jaezred Chaulssin , the skulkers of Vhaeraun —the term used to describe those members of the church of Vhaeraun who retained divine magic despite their god's death—and the followers of Ghaunadaur. The latter group was however a dying force, at least among drow, for Lolth successfully extinguished the knowledge about that god.</p>
<p>At some point in the years leading up to 1479 DR , Lolth ordered her servants to begin collecting blue fire items and relics important to Mystra in order to use them to craft her own Demon Weave . Her ultimate goal was to become the new goddess of magic, but she ended up failing with the return of Mystra. In truth, Lolth's plan was doomed to fail from its conception, because she lacked the competence and understanding to sustain a Weave. In fact, despite her efforts, Lolth wasn't actually creating her own Weave; she was merely leeching off the remaining strands of Mystra's, which acted as a barrier between Toril and another cataclysm: one of such an immensity that it could have wreaked havoc across the whole planet and its Underdark. Lolth's incompetence left the Weave on the verge of total collapse, and forced some of the then active Chosen of Mystra to sustain Lolth's construct on her behalf, unbeknownst to her, until Mystra recovered and reclaimed the Weave.</p>
<h3>Post-Sundering</h3>
<p>After the event known as the Second Sundering , Lolth was no longer unrivaled as the goddess of the drow (even if she still retained her position of dominance), for the dead members of the Dark Seldarine were revived. A further disadvantage for the Spider Queen, Eilistraee and Vhaeraun reached a truce and even reciprocal friendship after their return, which allowed them to focus their forces towards their main goal, rather than squandering resources in battling each other (although their followers still skirmished often). Moreover, Zinzerena managed to re-emerge and escape Lolth's grasp, depriving Lolth of the portfolio of assassination. Lolth also lost the portfolio of chaos (that she had stolen from Zinzerena about a century earlier): it went to Malyk , drow god of rebellion and wild magic.</p>
<p>The wizard Mordenkainen claimed that, after the Second Sundering, Vhaeraun had dramatically steered away from his previous stance of rebellion against Lolth's system, and instead assumed a position of subservience to the Spider Queen, even coming to embody the ideal of drow male according to the Lolthite matriarchy: "swift, silent, obedient". According to Mordenkainen, Vhaeraun's faith became tolerable in Lolth-controlled cities, and was often practiced by males who wished for a better lot in life, but that weren't willing to openly oppose Lolth's matriarchy, rather than by drow who strove to demolish the system at its root.</p>
