<p>King Brinnaq Torlath I "the Shining" was an Amnian monarch of the Torlath dynasty who greatly expanded the realm.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Brinnaq was the only son of King Rashturl . He had many sons including Esmel IV and Jhanos I , and his only daughter was Leluia .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>King Brinnaq led Amn in a period of expansion and mercantilism, becoming known as the realm's first "merchant king." In the Year of the Crawling Crags, 692 DR , Brinnaq negotiated the Tejarn Purchase—buying the lands north of the Sulduskoon River and south of the Tejarn Hills from the cash-strapped kingdom of Tethyr . These lands would later include Riatavin , Trailstone , and other settlements.</p>
<p>He died in 694 DR and was succeeded by his son Esmel IV, only for his son-in-law Arbas to set about killing every male Torlath in Amn, including Esmel IV and his own son Esmar . The sole survivor was Jhanos I, who returned from abroad and reclaimed the throne the following year.</p>
