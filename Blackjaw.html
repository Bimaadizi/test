<p>Blackjaw was a species of predatory fish that inhabited the Lake Glorfindar in the Starmetal Hills and remined active through the winter months under the lake's ice.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These somewhat uncommon creatures had long eel -like sinuous bodies and large heads with massive mouths. They had green scales.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Blackjaws were a nuisance for ice-fishers and anglers. They waited for a fish to be caught by an angler and snatched the easy prey before the catch could be dragged out of the ice hole. They were edible and were a part of a winter's hero's feasts served during the annual Simril celebration in Twilight Tor . The feast also consisted of cooked brown bream , candlefish , and durgrace .</p>
