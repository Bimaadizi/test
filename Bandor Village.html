<p>Bandor Village was a small but influential mining settlement in northwest Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village sat below the eastern Barren Mountains, southwest of the Bay of Ascore .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Bandor's people mined rich veins of gold and silver from the Barren Mountains , and traded it to nearby large settlements including the dwarves of Ascore , the flying enclave of Sanctuary , and the Rengarth of Vandal Station . The metals were then traded elsewhere in Netheril across the Narrow Sea .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The village was founded in 1423 NY (−2436 DR) , and spent its whole existence as a mining community. It was a place where common miners could strike it rich, but they contended with constant cave-ins, underground monster attacks, and lethal fights with other miners. It came to a sudden end in 2328 NY (−1531 DR) when a lethal plague killed every member of the community and passed on to nearby Vandal Station, where it killed another 4,000 before burning out.</p>
<p>It was reported that the plague originated from an interaction with winged humanoids who inhabited the nearby mountains .</p>
