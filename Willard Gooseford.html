<p>Willard Gooseford was a ranger who lived in the village of Snowmantle during the mid-14 th century DR , having called the peaceful hamlet his home longer than anyone else.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Willard was rather tall, at 6'2" (1.9 m), and had some trembling brought upon by old age. Despite this, he maintained his clever mind well into his golden years.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The elderly Willard was the uncle of Lanseril Snowmantle , the famed druid of the Knights of Myth Drannor , on his human mother's side.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For many years, Willard operated the winery within Snowmantle, fermenting unique mushrooms from the nearby Border Forest , which he barreled and sold to nearby Dalesfolk.</p>
<p>During the occupation of Snowmantle by Zhentilar forces after the year 1355 DR , Willard hid his keen mind and feigned a number of ailments to present himself in an entirely non-threatening manner to the Zhent slavers. When his nephew Lanseril was imprisoned within their home village, Willard took in his badger ally Lawrence , and used the particularly intelligent animal to maintain communication with his nephew.</p>
<p>A month after the Zhent army and the entire village of Snowmantle was leveled by a nature elemental in 1369 DR , Willard, Juliana Saan and Walter Geddstone returned to their home in order to rebuild.</p>
