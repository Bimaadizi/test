<p>The underwater boat was an experimental non-magical self-propelled submarine developed by Nadul Da Roni .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nadul's device was a sealed one-person boat equipped with paddlewheels and a flipper and was slowly propelled by the pilot's hand-pedaling. It contained enough air for the pilot to breathe for at least ten or more minutes, depending on how well they controlled their breathing, and a set of releasable sandbags for ballast allowed the vehicle to surface from the depths (so long as it wasn't carrying more than 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of passenger). Aside from the possibility of leaks, the vehicle was quite reliable and safe, especially compared to other inventions like the furnace wagon or heartland flier .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered the boat built by Nadul Da Roni.</p>
