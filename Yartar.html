<p>Yartar ( pronounced : /ˈ j ɑːr t ær / YAR-tarr ) was a prosperous and increasingly crowded fortified city located in the Dessarin Valley region of the Savage Frontier . It was a member city of the Lords' Alliance , and held a number of allies throughout the North .</p>
<p>The city was alive and full of trade, day and night. Competing trade caravans and trade barges loaded for bear passed through its walls at all hours. Beyond the hustle and bustle of honest citizens and traveling merchants was an unsavory criminal element, whose schemes and power hampered the city's ability to become one of the truly influential city-states of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city was connected by a fortified bridge wide enough to accommodate two wagons with room to spare to a citadel on the west bank. There, the Evermoor Way (linking Triboar and Silverymoon ) crossed the Surbrin. Yartar was a crossroads trading town, so it was always bustling with caravans entering and leaving its walls. It was renown as a place for merchants, smugglers, mercenaries, and spies from all over the North to meet and conduct business.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the population had grown to the point that older structures were torn down and new, taller, buildings needed to be erected, some as high as four stories.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Yartar was situated on the Evermoor Way , on the eastern bank of the River Surbrin , overlooking the nearby River Dessarin .</p>
<p>The Surbrin Trail ran north from the city through the hills on the other side of the Dessarin Valley toward the ruins of Nesmé . The trail hugged the eastern bank of the River Surbrin rather than enter the Evermoors . Yartaran soldiers patrolled the road.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The ruler of Yartar, the Waterbaron, was elected for life. The Waterbaron in 1366 DR was Belleethe Kheldorna . This position was previously held by Alahar Khaumfros , who had inherited the position from his father and who was later revealed to be the leader of the Kraken Society .</p>
<p>The Waterbaron in the years around 1491 DR was Nestra Ruthiol , a Tethyrian noblewoman woman in her fifties with a reputation for being shrewd and farseeing. Nestra believed that the Lords' Alliance was necessary for Yartar's survival and prosperity. She was aware of the Harper and Zhentarim presence in the city, but chose to intervene only when the wellbeing of her citizens is at risk.</p>
<h3>Defense</h3>
<p>The city was served by a mounted fighting force called the Shields of Yartar , that were headquartered in the Shield Tower .</p>
<h3>Relations</h3>
<p>Yartar was a member of the Lords' Alliance . A trade agreement with Goldenfields brought grain and produce to the city.</p>
<p>Yartar was the historic rival of Triboar and animosity between the two communities was pervasive. While it was typically held in good nature, if occasionally escalated to violence. The feud began when residents of each town blamed the other for the disappearance of the Lost Guide , a caravaneer that was transporting a large amount of gold between them.</p>
<h2>Trade & Industry</h2>
<p>Due to its unique location, on a major road near the crossing of two rivers, Yartar enjoyed a thriving fishing community. An abundance of locally-caught crab, eel and other types of seafood, helped the industry thrive.</p>
<p>It was known for its barge-building operation.</p>
<p>Yartar was an important way stop for caravans and traders traveling between its allied city of Silverymoon , and the great metropolis of Waterdeep . As such, many of its business catered to caravaneers, merchants and other Faerûnians that regularly traveled the roads of the North.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Maidens, 1361 DR , Baron Alahar Khaumfros attempted to further a plot to provoke the Lords' Alliance (particularly Waterdeep ) to war against Ruathym on behalf of the Kraken Society and Luskan . He was foiled in his attempt when Liriel Baenre , Fyodor , and Caladorn Cassalanter discovered the plot.</p>
<p>Around five years later, four illithids murdered Alahar in the Waterbaron's Hall for his fraudulent dealings of the Kraken Society's funds.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Yartarans were abducted by the elemental cults for conversion or sacrifice. These were mostly people who would not be missed; the poor and drunkards. The victims were held in the Temple of Howling Hatred .</p>
<p>That same year, members of the Hand of Yartar acquired a devastation orb from the Lord Protector of Triboar's vault. They attempted to auction it off to the highest bidder. Lord Khaspere Drylund , a member of the Kraken Society, sought to bribe or blackmail corrupt officials to support his efforts to become the next Waterbaron.</p>
<p>The following year , a nautiloid appeared over Yartar. It destroyed one of the city's tallest buildings and ensnared Yartarran citizens into its hull with its tentacle-like appendages. The illithid ship was quickly forced to teleport away by three githyanki warriors riding atop red dragons .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the three years between Shieldmeet years, Yartar would host the Hiring Fair on a field north of the city. This event would draw thousands of outcasts, wanderers, barbarians, criminals, and adventurers from the surrounding area to sell their labor to farmers, merchants, nobles, and anyone else that may have needed workers or bodyguards. It was common for adventuring bands to form at the fair.</p>
<p>During Shieldmeet, the city was treated to a grand festival sponsored by the local Tymoran church. This grand event featured much drinking, revelry, and contests of chance and skill, such as wrestling and various forms of gambling.</p>
<h2>Organizations</h2>
<p>As famous as any group within the city, the Hand of Yartar was a fractious thieves' guild made up entirely of women. While they were as large a criminal organization as any found on the Sword Coast North , infighting was common and prevented them from gaining real influence. The Hand of Yartar cooperated with the Zhentarim when it was advantageous to do so.</p>
<p>The Lionshield Coster was a trading company based in Yartar. Their symbol was a lion's head atop a field of blue.</p>
<p>A successful adventuring company called the Smiling Company operated out of Yartar for nearly a decade during this time. They made regular donations to the Happy Hall.</p>
