<p>Ice Reavers were a variety of enchanted handaxes created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR and originated from the barbarian tribes of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of Ice Reavers , with a +1 , +3 , and +8 enchantments that made the axe's edge deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three variants dealt damage with gravely cold with each swing and protected the wielder from the cold.</p>
<p>Stonefire axes could be created from an enchanted handaxe and some dragon 's blood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ice Reavers were originally wielded by Uthgardt barbarians of Icewind Dale. One story about these weapons talked about a powerful gang of fire giants that was lost in the northern tundra and how easily the Uthgardt warriors dispatched of them with their Ice Reaver axes. The warriors recovered a great sum of money from the slain giants , and, to commemorate the victory, the tribe's chieftain had more powerful Ice Reavers crafted. Subsequently, most of these axes mysteriously disappeared from the tribe's hands, and occasionally, a young warrior would get dispatch on a quest to retrieve one of these legendary weapons.</p>
<p>Ice Reavers with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure from the dreaded Wailing Death of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
