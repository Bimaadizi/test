<p>Lilianviaten Dlardrageth , who usually went by Lilten , was a gold elf cleric , a high priest and chosen of Beshaba , a Masked Lord of Waterdeep , and last prince of House Dlardrageth . He resided in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>He took a fiend (possibly a fey'ri ) as a mate and she bore him a daughter named Fayne .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lilten was formerly a cleric of Erevan Ilesere , a deity of the Seldarine . At some point, he betrayed his god and began worshiping Beshaba, possibly because Ereven lost his power during the Spellplague . Around the beginning of the 15 th century DR, Lilten became involved with a demoness and she produced a tiefling daughter whom they called Fayne. An eladrin named Ilira Nathalan , who happened to be Lilten's estranged wife, tracked down Lilten's demon lover and killed her, permanently scarring Fayne in the process.</p>
<p>In Waterdeep the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Lilten became aware of a young wizard named Myrin Darkdance , who had a very powerful spellscar . He enlisted the help of his daughter Fayne and hired a dwarven monk named Rath to kidnap her. Lilten's plot was foiled by the paladin Kalen Dren , though Lilten's involvement wasn't discovered.</p>
<p>Lilten traveled to Luskan in the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , apparently to keep an eye on Myrin, who was in the custody of the Dead Rats gang. While in Luskan, he meddled with the abyssal Fury plague, even giving a priestess of Beshaba a scroll to summon the plague swarm.</p>
<p>Later, Lilten directed Kalen and Myrin to the lair of the demon Scour , who was causing the plague, and the heroes destroyed the demon. Lilten gave Kalen a parcel containing the shards of Vindicator , which was apparently an attempt to lure Kalen to Westgate , where Kalen's would-be apprentice Rhetegast Hawkwinter had traveled.</p>
<p>Later in 1480 DR, Lilten journeyed to Westgate, apparently to continue manipulating Myrin. He tricked Rhett into thinking Kalen had lost his mind and intended to kill him, turning Rhett against Kalen. He also aided Fayne, who attempted to avenge her slain mother by killing Iliria.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lilten was described as a beautiful gold elf. While in Luskan, he appeared with a rack of antlers, a sign of Beshaba's favor, although it's unknown if this was his true form or just an illusion.</p>
