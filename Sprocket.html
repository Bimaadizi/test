<p>Sprockets were a type of mechanical component found in the Realms.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the dwarves of Besilmer constructed the Halls of the Hunting Axe , they built a complex array of machinery in order to ensure that the tomb of Torhild Flametongue would remain hidden. This included four large, stone flywheels that each sported an axle and were connected to a series of gears. Upon each axle was a sprocket, which could be slid along to engage a different part of the machinery.</p>
<p>During the time of the Everlasting Rime , a gnome artificer by the name of Doxi Whirglitz constructed a clockwork knucklehead trout , a construct whose design featured sprockets.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers came to the Halls of the Hunting Axe in 1491 DR , they had to manipulate those sprockets in order to gain access to Tormhild's decoy tomb. These same adventurers would discover within Besilmer's ruined city of Tyar-Besil a +1 shield with a sprocket on its front. This sprocket slowly turned clockwise, making a single rotation each hour.</p>
