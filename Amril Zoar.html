<p>Amril Zoar was a murderer and a descendant of the Zoar family in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Per Piergeiron Paladinson , who mind-touched him, he was young and full of excitement.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had an enchanted sword. He had also acquired numerous Harper pins on which he'd layered no end of enchantments, and at least one potion of healing , which he kept at his hideout. He also possessed a tome from Ahghairon himself discussing the use of echo gates .</p>
<p>His hideout was a place with high, vaulted ceilings, and pillars, with at least one coat of arms, strongly implied to be the home of the Zoar family.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>His swordcraft was more than a match even for Storm Silverhand , and his sorcery was likewise second to none. He had also become a master of echo gates .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>An unnamed Harper was his tutor in the Art . He had a network of spies at his service.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One day, a knight of Waterdeep slew Zoar's father and his tutor in the Art, a Harper who'd never given his name, but who died protecting Amril. This event happened at some point after 1346 DR , as he judged it happened during Tamaeril Bladesemmer 's tenure as a Lord of Waterdeep , which began in that year. In the years since, Zoar came to possess a book written by Ahghairon on the use of echo gates, capable of bypassing most of the wards in Waterdeep.</p>
<p>On early Flamerule of the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , he resolved to get revenge, and using the echo gates, he ambushed Piergeiron Paladinson, charmed him and extracted from his mind the identities of all the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. He then attacked the open lord, severely wounding him; three nights later, he slew Resengar and Tamaeril Bladesemmer , as well as the latter's dog and songbird in the same night, leaving a Harper pin on Resengar.</p>
<p>In the same night he attempted to ambush Mirt at the Inner Audience Chamber of the palace, following him into the sewers through a secret passage; after taking some attacks, he tried to lure him into an exploding portal instead. He then used another gate to rush into the Yawning Portal , where he was fought back into the portal by Tamsil Dryndilstann and Mhaere Dryndilstann before he could reach Durnan , dropping a Harper pin before he left. The pin left at Resengar's was examined by Laeral Silverhand , who was nearly blown to bits by a trap laid on it.</p>
<p>He was afterwards ambushed by Storm Silverhand, who used a special spell to teleport herself to any Harper pin that had been tampered with in Waterdeep. They were soon joined by Elminster , Piergeiron Paladinson, Asper , and Mirt, and they swiftly defeated and immobilized Amril Zoar, who confessed to his plan afterwards. Before they could kill him, Storm pleaded for them to have mercy on him as he was worthy of becoming a Harper, and swore that she would kill him herself if he returned to his murderous ways.</p>
