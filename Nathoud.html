<p>Nathoud was a fortified town located in the northern region of the Hordelands bordering Rashemen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nathoud sat in the hill country at the feet of the southern slopes of the Icerim Mountains .</p>
<p>Wood was used in the construction of Nathoud since stone-working was little known in the region. The buildings of Nathoud were typically two stories tall and had large overhanging eaves with gently sloping roofs. Elaborate carvings decorated most buildings.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The Myir , a clan of Nars , originally built the town when they came to settle, since they could not compete with the fierce Khassadi horsemen of the region.</p>
<p>The Myir of Nathoud were famous for their breeding of the Nathoudi stallion . A yearly horse fair was held in Nathoud. Vendors interested in selling horses during this time needed to apply for a license. Races were held where vendors and horse-breeders could show off their prized animals.</p>
