<p>Olostin , also known as the Baron of Dread , was a bandit lord of the Shadowed Age of Netheril . He was a vicious bandit lord who led an extravagant life that rivaled that of the empire's own arcanists . He became a rallying force for the disaffected citizens of Netheril, who were angered by the rule of the magocracy's leaders.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In his youth, Olostin was prone to anger, feeling he was owed great opportunities. He also showed compassion for non- humans like those that invaded Netheril.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Olostin and his forces dwelled in what became known as Dread Keep , a fortress situated west of the enclave of Unity .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Olostin was born in Netheril, where he was eventually exiled when his anger became unstable. In the wilds of Netheril, he encountered a lone phaerimm who asked about the magic being cast on the surface that caused his kind to starve. Olostin disclosed all of Netheril's secrets to the phaerimm. The phaerimm left, but not before telling him of a secret location in the Far Horns where the arcanists could not reach him.</p>
<p>Olostin quickly emerged as the most bloodthirsty bandit lord in Netheril's history. By the age of 20, he was already railing against the rule of the archwizards . He and his forces attacked the city of Unity in 3348 NY (−511 DR) . Others who also shared his distaste for the archwizards joined his cause.</p>
<p>Some 33 years after his raids began, however, in 3382 NY (−477 DR) , a high-level arcanist and a group of 250 warriors attacked Dread Keep and killed Olostin with a Noanar's fireball spell. The few notes and scattered plans that survived seemed to indicate that Olostin was in league with the phaerimm, whom the Netherese were still trying to locate.</p>
