<p>The Igidujin were a tribe of humans living on the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands . They were among the tribes mistakenly called " Tuigan " by outsiders following the Horde Wars .</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>They made their home around the city of Quaraqand , deep in the southern Chigidi Mountains .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They were only a minor tribe of the Plain of Horses, but were known for their ferocity. They were ruled by the cruel and despotic Qaland family. Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , their qaghan was Qaland T'akk , a man without mercy and bent on conquest.</p>
<p>Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain. Furthermore, Qaland T'akk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by T'akk himself.</p>
<p>They spoke the Chuchian tongue.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The Igidujin had an animistic faith.</p>
<p>Their warriors favored clubs , both the war club known as chokhor modo and the throwing club called a sidam . Their commanders also employed hawks trained to attack targets. Their beaks and claws were both sharpened to a razor's edge.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From Quaraqand, the Igidujin often raided the surrounding villages, nomad camps, and caravans, especially those of the rival Fankiang tribe, whom T'akk hated. Ostensibly, most of these raids were to steal Steppe horses but in truth it was largely to sate their bloodlust. They massacred their victims, leaving no man, woman, or child alive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Originally, they were a collection of simple mountain hsing (clans), only loosely assembled before they fell into deadly warring with one another. After almost a century of this, the pitiless Qaland Shurijah , united the clans and forged the Igidujin tribe. The cruel and despotic Qaland family reigned over the Igidujin ever since.</p>
