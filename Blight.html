<p>A blight was a plant-based creature.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Blights were plants that had been tainted with evil, usually after a forest was corrupted by an evil force. They resembled dead versions of their original plants. The first blights were spawned when the vampire Gulthias was stabbed with a stake. The stake turned into a sapling which grew into a tree. This tree released seeds from which the first blights emerged.</p>
