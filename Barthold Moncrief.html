<p>Barthold Moncrief was one of the Magistrates of Cormyr , who performed work in the towns of Eveningstar and Wheloon in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Barthold was a human man with a light skin tone, hair and beard bleached with age, and icy blue eyes. He wore quality robes of the Magistrates.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Barthold worked at the Wheloon Docks alongside Magistrates Abella Toth , Celia Pendrick , and Cornelius Latrimor as they oversaw the operations of the prison and investigated criminals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1480s DR, Barthold was joined by Magistrates Abella and Celia as they investigated the Sharran escapee Dedryk Black in Eveningstar. They hired a band of adventurers from the world of Eberron , and tasked them with searching for a suspected Sharran hideout in the foothills of the Storm Horns , with Magistrate Abella Toth leading the investigation. When the infamous Dedryk Black and his cronies were captured, Magistrate Barthold Moncrief took over and supervised the prisoners' transportation via river boat back to Wheloon for imprisonment.</p>
<p>Though accompanied by a company of Purple Dragons and the same adventurers, Barthold's convoy was attacked while making camp along the Wyvernwater riverside. Lizardfolk raiders charged at the Cormyreans and were fought off, only for the shaman Srass Marnanr to ambush from the water and use a dimension door to abscond with Dedryk. Moncrief rallied his forces and sent the adventurers on in pursuit of the lizardfolk, fighting through a party led by the great warrior Rynarr Nosryrr and eventually coming across a small camp where the shaman Srass and the still-bound Dedryk were hiding. After further battle the shaman was defeated and Dedryk Black was recovered, then delivered safely to Wheloon.</p>
