<p>Bastion was a magical tower shield kept at the Old Man's Face in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The shield was extremely large and heavy, and bore enhancements that made it surprisingly adept as a bashing weapon. It also performed admirably in the role of actually protecting the bearer.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bastion was forged on a distant plane, rather than the Prime Material plane , and saw many battles in its life. It somehow ended up in the possession of Branson Blackboot , the corrupt innkeeper of the Old Man's Face inn, and may have been seized by the Harpers when they searched the inn for a fragment of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll that was hidden there.</p>
