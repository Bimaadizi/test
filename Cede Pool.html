<p>Cede Pool was a body of water in the Shinantra Mountains that was a holy site of Jannath during the time of ancient Netheril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The pool was the source of the Cede Run , an unusually pure and clear river. Jannathans believed that the pool was a blessed site and that it provided prophetic dreams and visions to those who visited, and a great many pilgrims arrived every summer solstice after passing through the friendly Amaunator -aligned town of Trinity . Skeptics maintained that the visions were mere delusions brought on by a waterborne taint, even though the water source was renowned for its purity.</p>
