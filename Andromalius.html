<p>Andromalius was served by Avnas , a derro from Acheron. He considered her a valuable asset for her abilities in engineering . He gave her the book of patterns , which ultimately led to the pixelating curse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While Andromalius ruled Cube 1717, three adventurers tried and failed to overthrow him. They were individually charged and then their heads were cut off and merged together into one body. The three were brought back to life as one being: the skull lord Vargo . Andromalius then imprisoned Vargo in Cube 1717's prisons for 1 million life sentences.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years later, his servants discovered a quadrone from Mechanus . It was given to his servant Avnas to perform experiments on. This transformed the quadrone into the Archquadrone , who then created the pixelating curse. The curse spread quickly through Cube 1717 and caused a conflict in which Andromalius was slain.</p>
<p>After his death, Vargo, now the ruler of Cube 1717, kept Andromalius's head in a case made of glass . The head was pixelated by the pixelating curse, and rotten.</p>
