<p>Casin Cu Calas , or the Triple C , were a terrorist group made up of humans , elves , and dwarves from the Silver Marches who attacked small orc settlements in and around the Kingdom of Many-Arrows in the late 15 th century DR . The organization's name came from an elven saying that meant "honor in battle". Non-affiliated elves became upset at the use of this name and took to calling the group the Night Riders instead.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The group operated as a kind of cult, with the leaders donning black-and-red robes and black hoods to preside over racist chants about killing orcs.</p>
<p>The organization comprised small bands of warriors, who attacked orc homesteads and caravans. They beheaded any males they found, and thrust the severed heads on stakes around their camps.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1485 DR , Drizzt Do'Urden came upon a band of five Night Riders who'd attacked and massacred an orcish caravan. He fought them until a band of elf warriors of the Moonwood led by Lord Hralien came to his aid and they defeated them all.</p>
