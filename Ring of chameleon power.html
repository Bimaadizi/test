<p>A ring of chameleon power was a magic item capable of disguising the wearer with their surroundings.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This item allowed the wearer to blend in with their surroundings to the point where they were nearly invisible. Additionally, the ring could make the wearer appear as another species if viewed from a minimum distance of 60 ft (18 m), though this trickery was discovered quickly if the wearer did not leave the vicinity of those viewing them.</p>
