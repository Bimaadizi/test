<p>Wogbog was a friendly and simple-minded hermit who lived out of a tent in the Blade Cliffs circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The strange hermit was dressed in dirty rags. Wogbog had a toothless mouth and emaciated chest. His stringy hair was dirt-speckled with pieces of dead leaves stuck in it. He mumbled "wogbog" to himself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was known of Wogbog's past. His speech was simplistic, and he seemingly was not able to communicate in anything but select short words. By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , his tent could be found among the trees and grape bushes of the Blade Cliffs. He sustained himself on bugsâ€”his favorite food. However, the lice that covered his body were a delicious treat too. During the events recounted in Darkness over Daggerford , Wogbog spied on orcs and smuggling pirate ships that sailed past the Blade Cliffs towards the secret base within the Crab's Claw Coast . Surprisingly, Wogbog found a way into the ancient tomb of the lich Umgatlik , but despite being oblivious to the dangers within, the hermit remained unmolested by the ancient evil.</p>
