<p>The Senate of Innarlith was the ruling body of the city-state of Innarlith and headed by a leader that had the title of Ransar. Entrance to the senate was open to the wealthy who purchased their seats on the senate.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The senate was composed of a large number of men and women that came from the aristocracy of Innarlith. Some of them were born into wealthy senatorial families, while others purchased their seats after acquiring enough wealth. The senate itself was further divided into smaller committees that had responsibility for different functions in the city-state. Once a person had purchased their seat, they usually remained on the senate for life.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Senate convened its meetings in the Chamber of Law and Civility , the main legislative house of Innarlith. The Ransar's palace was called the Palace of Many Spires and it was located nearby in the second quarter of Innarlith.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The members of the senate were composed of the city's wealthy elite and generally they controlled most of the commercial activity in the city-state. Class conflicts between them and the poor working masses of Innarlith occurred.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-1360s DR , the Red Wizards of Thay secretly developed great influence over the body of the senate. This became especially true on Highharvestide in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , when Senator Salatis used an army of black firedrakes supplied by the clandestine Red Wizard Marek Rym√ºt to assassinate and overthrow Ransar Osorkon . This after the latter began a project to construct a canal that would link the Lake of Steam to the Vilhon Reach , which threatened the Thayan trade in magical portals for ships. Marek then attempted to control Ransar Salatis as his puppet to rule the city, who agreed to the establishment of a Thayan enclave in Innarlith.</p>
<p>Senator Pristoleph later in 1371 DR raised an army and laid siege to Innarlith in order to overthrow Salatis and make himself ransar. Pristoleph succeeded and became the new ransar of Innarlith. However, Marek and his Red Wizards could not control Pristoleph, who violated their wishes. Marek then fostered a faction of senators and their supporters to start a civil war to overthrow Pristoleph in 1374 DR , but the attempt failed and Pristoleph held onto power. Pristoleph then executed and exiled the senators who had fought against him, as well as the Thayans who had been behind their attempt.</p>
