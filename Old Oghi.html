<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For some unknown reason, animals born in the Dragonbone Vale were fiercer and bigger than their kin. Old Oghi was a prime example of that.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, Old Oghi was well known to the rangers that frequented the mountain valley. One story told of a young blue dragon killing a deer and Oghi fearlessly charging at the wyrm and scaring it off with a terrifying, earth-shattering roar, claiming the meat.</p>
<p>When the Cult of the Dragon claimed the Dragonbone Vale, Old Oghi became a target of a hunt with adventurers being offered a hefty reward for the successful hunt. It is unknown if Old Oghi was felled by the adventurers' swords .</p>
