<p>Davalaer was a warrior from the Dales .</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Davalaer was a survivor of a battle at an unknown year prior to 1372 DR , where he estimated the ultimate death count to be around ten thousand. He lamented that many Dalesmen would not be returning home and that people would forget this pain, and battles would ultimately happen again.</p>
<p>Some of his memories lived on, given by Mystra to Elminster Aumar . However, evil would eventually cost even him those memories, as the archdevil Nergal would forcibly wrest them from Elminster while he was captive in Avernus , on 1372 DR .</p>
