The half-elf child was Ghleanna Stormlake who was raised by her cruel elven family after Jesenalae died in childbirth. Years later, Garth made a confession on his deathbed about the elven paramour he abandoned and about Athan's half-sister. Athan managed to find his family and took her away from the unloving home. Eventually, Athan's circle of friends introduced the young half-elf to Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale and Ghleanna Stormlake became his apprentice.</p>

Elminster Aumar, aware of similar pools across the Moonsea swiftly assembled the volunteers to stop whatever was causing it. He places a group of hero to guard the pool in Phlan, and sent another, with the hero Athan in charge to investigate the Cult of the Dragon activities in the ruins of Myth Drannor.

Eventually he was rescued and joined the second group of Elminster's adventurers, later known as the Veiled Ones , who initially were the guardians of the pool , but followed Athan's group through the portal. Together they defeated the cult leader Kya Mordrayn and destroyed Pelendralaar. They aided Anorrweyn Evensong in restoring the mythal over the city, and drained the accursed corrupted pools of radiance returning the Moonsea region to relative peace.</p>
