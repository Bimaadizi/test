<p>Ss'zuraass'nee , the City of Abominations , was a large yuan-ti city in the underdark , half a mile under the lizardfolk kingdom of Kalran .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>This city stood beside a dried-up riverbed that used to drain deeper into the Underdark.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The walls of Ss'zuraass'nee were carved to look like a snake 's digestive tract. Moreover, there was an acidic tang that hung in the air and made unaccustomed creatures uncomfortable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one time, Ss'zuraass'nee served as the main center of trade between Najara and several communities in the Underdark. It was normal for drow merchants from Sshamath and Eryndlyn , grimlock merchants from Reeshov , derro merchants from Tsenviilyq , and illithid merchants from Llacerellyn to be seen trading in the city. The city had a centuries-long standing alliance with Llacerellyn, and as a result of the positive relations, many yuan-tillithids roamed the streets by 1373 DR .</p>
