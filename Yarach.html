<p>Yarach was a white-furred gnoll belonging to the Frosthunger Horde as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Yarach appeared to be extremely confident and well-fed.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, after many goblinoid members of the Frosthunger Horde fled Dragonscar Gorge for Shimmersky Valley in order to escape the hard labor imposed upon them by Shattercrown , Yarach was charged with leading a group of gnolls to guard the entrance from the Valley to the Gorge.</p>
<p>A group of adventurers tasked to drive the Horde from the Valley and sever their connection to the Gorge ended up attacking and defeating the overconfident Yarach. However, they were not able to prevent the gnoll from crying out with a series of yelps that echoed into Dragonscar Gorge and alerted the other gnolls of the Horde.</p>
