<p>Torm's Hand was a small village found on the Sword Coast during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The village comprised a smattering dirt roads set over uneven earth, winding between a smattering of stone-and-wood structures.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located just beyond the walls of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Due to its close proximity to the sprawling metropolis, Torm's Hand fell under the protection of the Baldurian army known as the Flaming Fist .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or around the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the villages of Torm's Hand hosted a festival to celebrate the life of Klysandral , the local paladin that sacrificed his life to thwart of the efforts of cultists acting in service of Asmodeus . Folks came from far and wide to celebrate Kylsandral's life, including members of the Hellriders and the Flaming Fist. Notable among the celebrants was Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard , a longtime friend of Kylsandral.</p>
<p>As the procession made its way though Torm's Hand and up towards the local Tormish church, a hellcyst opened up beneath the village. The local holy house known as 'the Fortress' was pulled down to Avernus in the Nine Hells . The planewalker Emirikol attempted to saved everyone caught in the chaos, using his skyship called the Demonwing , but the final fate of the village and its people was unknown.</p>
