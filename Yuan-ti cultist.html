<p>A yuan-ti cultist was a yuan-ti that devoted itself to a life of religious worship of Merrshaulk , the chief god of the yuan-ti pantheon , learning how to harness the power of his church's rituals and enhance the race's innate psionic abilities.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>These cultists rarely left their temple warrens once initiated, being bound to them. Their daily lives were filled with hours of ritual and repetitive learning, while their nights of sleep were filled with horrid visions. On rare occasions they would be set out on quests with a large entourage of yuan-ti purebloods . Such quests were generally for the purpose of establishing a new shrine to Merrshaulk.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Cultists were divided into five standard ranks and one rare sixth. There were the Outer Circle, the Third Circle, the Second Circle, the First Circle, and the Inner Circle. The coveted sixth rank, the Voice of Merrshaulk, entailed transcending one's mortal nature and becoming an immortal emissary of the yuan-ti's chief god.</p>
<p>For any halfblood cultists, ascending to the third rank required undergoing a painful, night-long ritual that transformed them into a human -headed yuan-ti abomination . For those who were serpent-headed abominations prior to reaching the third rank, they would undergo a ceremony to change that. In both cases, this involved the participation of no less than six abominations of the fifth rank, members of the Inner Circle.</p>
<p>The role of cultist was particularly common among yuan-ti holy guardians .</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The position of cultist was taken up by abominations and halfbloods. In order to be initiated an individual had to have reached adulthood and passed a coming-of-age ritual, as well as possess the ability to cast third-degree divine spells , and some knowledge of alchemy and religion.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a cultist ascended through the ranks they gained unique powers, access to sacred psionic rituals, and the many secret alchemical brews of the yuan-ti race. They also typically knew the art of scrying . Those of the Outer Circle learned how to how make the special mixture for making broodguards and tainted ones . Cultists in the Second Circle cultists were taught the secret alchemical ceremony for transforming a tainted one into a yuan-ti pureblood. Cultists in the First Circle were taught the secret ceremony for transforming a pureblood into a halfblood. And cultists in the Inner Circle were taught the closely guarded, day-long ceremony for transforming a half-blood into an abomination.</p>
<p>Novice cultists learned how to spray their yuan-ti poison out at attackers, gained access to spells of the Suffering domain , and an ability similar to the spell sticks to snakes .</p>
<p>Upon ascending to the Third Circle, a cultist underwent ritual tattooing . Depending upon what limbs the yuan-ti had, this was done on either their arms, legs, tail, or snake appendages. Three times per day they could launch these tattoos from their body as real venomous snakes. The snakes would then fly back to the cultist and had to be swallowed in order to make them reappear as tattoos on the body. The process of swallowing these conjured snakes posed no harm to the cultist.</p>
<p>Cultists in the Third Circle also became more in tuned with the psionic powers innate to yuan-ti and learned to focus their mental power towards a special ritual. Called the Chant of Pain , this sacrament of dancing and chanting caused mental damage to one living creature within 60 feet (18 meters). Being a mental effect, this had no affect on plants and oozes .</p>
<p>Cultists in the Second Circle grew even stronger in their innate psionic abilities and learned how to channel their mental power into an even more potent psionic ritual, the Chant of Agony . When one rose to the First Circle their yuan-ti poison became more virulent, they gained the ability to cast unhallow once per week. As they progressed onward the cultist would gain the supernatural power to command all manner of snakes and reptiles , as though they had cast dominate animal , and they learn a more potent version of the Chant of Agony that could potentially outright kill a living creature, making them a sacrifice to Merrshaulk. Those of the highest mortal ranking, the Inner Circle, found their venom to be even deadlier and gained the power to cast unholy aura once per day.</p>
<p>Should a cultist be deemed worthy of rising above the highest mortal rank in Merrshaulk's church, they would transcend their mortal essence and become a native outsider , an emissary of the chief yuan-ti god. A Voice of Merrshaulk gained a degree of spell resistance, a supernatural ability to telepathically communicate with other creatures from a distance of 100 feet (30 meters), and a mind-affecting ability to command any yuan-ti, similar in affect to using the dominate monster spell.</p>
