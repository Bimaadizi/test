<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unkra was raised by an orcish clan somewhere outside of the city of Neverwinter. The clan taught her their relatively primitive herbalist skills and techniques. When Unkra was exposed to the modern advancements in herbalism and alchemy, she left her home and embarked on a quest to learn and master new techniques. The search led the half-orc to Neverwinter, where she settled and made a living by selling her alchemical services.</p>
