<p>Mola was an Adept of the Absolute , stationed in the Moonrise Towers during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mola wore the uniform armor of an Adept of the Absolute – a night-blue armored garb and a cowled high-raising helmet. He had a dark green skin and fur tone, and his face had thick bloated dark veins – the evidence of an illithid tadpole infection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Adept Mola was among those who joined the new religion that sprang in the Western Heartlands . He was stationed within the Moonrise Towers, along the stairwell that led up to its second floor. The fortress was controlled by the Absolute's warlord – General Ketheric Thorm . Like many other members of the cult, Mola's fate remained unknown as he could've perished in battle when the High Harper Jaheira and her True Soul allies stormed the Moonrise.</p>
