<p>Elbix's Stonestick was an enchanted rod was originated from the Elemental Plane of Earth .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Contrary to its bloated reputation, Elbix's Stonestick was a simple rod that held sixteen uses of the stoneskin spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This rod's namesake was Elbix , a gnome apprentice conjurer who managed to summon an elder earth elemental one time. The creature brought Elbix's Stonestick to the Prime Material plane , explained its power, and left it with the gnome. Elbix used the rod's story and its greatly exaggerated powers to score free drinks at the local taverns from awe-stricken crowds following that event. With these telltales, Elbix's reputation grew until one day it was tested.</p>
<p>Several years after Stonestick became Elbix's property, the gnome town became menaced by Chief Gnarltooth and his gang of marauding n ettins . The gnome leader summoned Elbix to save the settlement from impending doom. With the conjurer 's lies swelling the Stonestick's powers to legendary proportions, the town's defenders did not bother to even build defenses against the invading giants. The defenders hoped the rod was to obliterate Gnarltooth with a single use.</p>
<p>Elbix, of course, knew that his lies caught up with him and did not hope to survive when he faced Gnarltooth. The ettin grabbed the terrified gnome. He brought the flailing little creature for a closer look but accidentally received Stonestick right in the eye. Gnarltoothtripped backward and impaled himself on his own spear , dying instantly. With their leader defeated, ettins fled. Elbix's uncanny luck saved his life and intended to remain alive, so he tossed the Stonestick into the closest river.</p>
<p>Elbix's Stonestick eventually ended up in possession of Boonmoppet 's master. The wizard , and later a lich, was killed before 1372 DR , leaving his tower and his magical goods in the hands of the lonely imp familiar.</p>
