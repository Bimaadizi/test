<p>Mischka Solmen was a human acolyte of Waukeen who helped to oversee the Temple of the Coinmaiden in Phandalin following its construction in the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Alongside fellow acolyte Hesten Jenz , Mischka preached the word of Waukeen during regular services at the Temple of the Coinmaiden.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mischka and Hesten oversaw the temple services at the behest of Ditch Fundi , who oversaw the temple's business. Ditch's willingness to defer to the two acolytes was seen by them as a sign of great trust, and they both were fiercely loyal to their boss. In truth, Ditch had ulterior motives and was not truly a member of the Church of Waukeen ; however, Mischka was not aware of this.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the transformation of the old location of Barthen's Provisions into the Temple of the Coinmaiden in 1496 DR, Mischka and Hesten were charged by Ditch Fundi with the spiritual duties of the temple. With a month, the pair had earned the trust of the townsfolk.</p>
