<p>The Binwabi were one of the tribes of the Bedine people that lived in the desert of Anauroch .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>They were among tribes that united together in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR to resist the Zhentarim campaign of conquest. The tribe fought under the leadership of the sorceress Ruha , who they perceived as the outlander warrior named Lander , in the final battle of the conflict at the ruins of Orofin . They rushed through a breach in the wall and held their ground until they received reinforcements in the form of 300 of their fellow Bedine warriors.</p>
