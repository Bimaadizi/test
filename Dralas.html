<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR, Sofina sent for Dralas and his band of six fellow warriors after she discovered the wild shaped Doric spying on her and Forge Fitzwilliam in Castle Never . Arriving by boat on the Neverwinter River , they met Sofina at the docks. Sofina ordered him to hunt down and kill Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , and Simon Aumar . But first, she wanted Dralas to dispatch Blackwood and his Neverwintan guards because they'd failed to stop Edgin and Holga's escape. Dralas slew them all single-handedly.</p>
<p>Later, Dralas and his men caught up to Edgin, Holga, Simon, and Doric, who'd been joined by Xenk Yendar, as they rode through the Dessarin Hills and Kryptgarden Forest , though he could only watch them through his spyglass from atop a high bluff nearby. The assassins climbed steathily down after them and tracked them through the Underdark all the way to their destinationâ€”the ruins of Dolblunde . Dralas and Xenk confronted and taunted one another, but the paladin handily took down the whole squad of assassins, as his companions provided a little aid but mostly just watched. At last, Xenk dueled and defeated his old enemy Dralas. But he and the other undead warriors rose again, their wounds regenerating, and gave chase. Then they were all interrupted by the surprise appearance of the red dragon Themberchaud , far from his home. He took care of the undead assassins, by simply running down and eating them; if Dralas was restored, then it was in the dragon's stomach.</p>
