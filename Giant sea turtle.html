<p>Giant sea turtles , otherwise known simply as giant turtles , were a monstrous variety of the mundane reptiles of the same name .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures resembled the mundane sea turtle in all ways but size, including being very slow-moving. They had large bony shells — the upper half known as a carapace and the lower half known as a plaston — from which their limbs and head extended out from. While some species could hide themselves within these shells, others were incapable of doing so and thus could only plaster their limbs to the sides of their shells for protection.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>These creatures were largely non-aggressive. They usually tended to hide within their shells when confronted with danger rather than, rather than fleeing or fighting. Though if seriously harmed, persistently abused, or persistently annoyed they would fight fiercely.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Giant turtles had very long lifespans, ranging from thirty to up to a hundred and fifty years.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These creatures fought by using their giant jaws.</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<h2>Reputation</h2>

<p>Beyond Toril, these creatures could be found on the planet of Oerth .</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Some were known to transform the harvested carapaces of giant turtles into small huts, strong roofs, or even boats. Those that dwelled in tropical regions were said to have the most attractive of shells.
