<p>Amara Ildacer was the second-in-command of the N'Vaelahr of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Amara was born in 8 DR as a member of the Audark clan.</p>
<p>Amara at one point joined the Harpers in Twilight . In 711 DR , Amara and Aolis Ildacer , after a meeting with the Grand Mage Ualair , Arms-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal , and Councilor Phraan Audark , decided to create the N'Vaelahr , a covert army.</p>
<p>In 712 DR , Aolis devised and supported the Spider's Truce , a secret alliance with the drow of House Dhuurniv in exchange for the drow's possession of the Twisted Tower of Ashaba . Despite being viewed as traitors, the allied Dhuurniv–N'Vaelahr troops fought very well against the Army of Darkness . In Midwinter – Alturiak 1 of 713 DR , Aolis fell alongside Matron Mother Laele Dhuurniv , and the Spider Truce was ended. In that battle, Laele killed Aolis from behind but afterward was quickly killed by Amara.</p>
<p>As the new leader of the N'Vaelahr, she continued to fight, despite no longer being permitted dealings with Myth Drannor's army for N'Vaelahr's bad reputation.</p>
<p>Amara survived the city's fall and died in 821 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Amara and her husband Aolis were both able Akh'Faer officers.</p>
<p>Only Amara and her husband knew the identities of the Councilors that supported the N'Vaelahr.</p>
