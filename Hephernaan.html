<p>Hephernaan was a red abishai and the main architect of the crusade against Dragonspear Castle in 1368 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hephernaan, a servant of Belhifet , was sent to Faerûn in order to find a way to open a gate to the Hells . Disguised as a human cleric / mage , Hephernaan found an ideal pawn in the aasimar Caelar Argent , who had read the Tome of The Nine when she was child and was saved only by the sacrifice of her uncle.</p>
<p>Hephernaan hid his true identity well and managed to convince Caelar to lead a crusade to invade Avernus in order to rescue her uncle. They gathered an army and marched to Dragonspear Castle, where it was known that a gate to the Nine Hells existed.</p>
