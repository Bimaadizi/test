<p>Tahan was a druid and a resident of the Emerald Grove during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Tahan was resentful of the tieflings that were given temporary residence within the Emerald Grove following the Descent of Elturel into the Nine Hells . The fact their presence attracted violence to the Emerald Grove was too much for her to forgive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Archdruid Halsin allowed a community of tiefling refugees take up residence within the Emerald Grove, just before leaving himself to investigate strange goings on associated with the enigmatic Moonrise Towers . These two factors combined with the misguided leadership of the temporary leader Kagha , threw the grove into turmoil and upset druids like Tahan.</p>
<p>Tahan was among the druids tapped to perform the Rite of Thorns , a ritual utilizing the idol of Silvanus that would hide away the grove from outsiders and protect it from the world beyond.</p>
