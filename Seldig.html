<p>Seldig was a deep gnome fighter / illusionist from Blingdenstone .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Seldig was the third svirfneblin who Drizzt Do'Urden would know by name. Drizz met him some decade after leaving Menzoberranzan , and to Seldig and his fellow youths, he shared the tale of how he battled and slayed a basilisk . Around 1357 DR , Seldigâ€™s svirfneblin patrol encountered Catti-brie disguised as a drow female, with the help of Agatha's mask . In 1338 DR , Seldig and fellow gnome, Pumkato , played with Guenhwyvar , and they recognized the powerful beast as a friend, so they stopped the attack on Catti-brie.</p>
<p>In 1362 DR , the deep gnome finally, like his longtime friend Pumkato, become a burrow warden.</p>
