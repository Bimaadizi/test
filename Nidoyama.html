<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nidoyama was located in western Maeshi Province on the island of Shinkoku . It was one of the few snow-covered peaks in Kozakura, boasting several small glaciers that graced its narrow cleft valleys.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While Nidoyama seemed unremarkable at first glance, its significance lied in the enduring presence of korobokuru . Despite the majority of their kin having migrated to Tenmei ages ago, the korobokuru in this region steadfastly refused to emigrate and continued to call Nidoyama their home.</p>
<p>Additionally, the area surrounding Nidoyama was inhabited by numerous river spirit folk who held special ties to the run-off streams flowing from the glaciers.</p>
