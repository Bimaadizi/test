<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tiphera tir-Yseldre was a noble from the Solonese empire. Her family was disfavored by the king of Solon, who posted them in lands to the south, squarely in territory claimed by the tyrannical great blue wyrm Sturykkazynarr. While she studied the martial and magical arts at the capital, the dragon tyrant destroyed her home and slew all her family. Swearing vengeance, she struck against one of his scions, a young blue dragon called Vurkkazynarr , and set its skull on an enchanted helm as a challenge against Sturykkazynarr.</p>
<p>She spent a number of years fighting the dragon's forces. However, she'd grown into such a popular folk hero that she became a threat to the legitimacy of King Andizen of Solon. He led her into an ambush at the hands of her draconic foe's forces at the Raurinshield mountains. The dragon tyrant took part in that ambush personally, and though Tiphera and all her companions were slain, she managed to land a killing blow upon the great wyrm.</p>
<p>After her death, King Andizen had her interred with great honors in a mausoleum on the Raurinshield mountains, along with her helmet.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Her helmet soon went missing from the tomb. However, for one of the rites required to use it to its full power, the wielder had to pay their respects at her mausoleum.</p>
