<p>Petathal was a large island located somewhere west across the sea from Faer√ªn and south of the Korinn Archipelago .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the 13 th century DR , this chain of islands was conquered by Northlanders . Later in 1228 DR , a noble adventurer from this island named Viledel led a band of humans and demihumans across the sea to the Korinn Archipelago, seeking to colonize the lands and aspiring to one day create a strong maritime empire.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>One belief among the people of Petathal was that one day the gods would decree that it was time for the dead to awaken. As a result, it was a practice to bury their noble dead alongside presents, treasures, weapons, boats, and even servants so that they would have their favorite things when it was time for them to arise.</p>
