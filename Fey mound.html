<p>Fey mounds were hidden burial barrows of wild fey , which often contained treasures buried with the fey. The soil from fey mounds was thought to be magical , hallowed as if effected by the hallow spell , and displayed additional effects such as confusion or hallucinatory terrain . Because of this, individuals highly attuned to magic could sometimes sense a mound's presence and some used them in rituals to increase the fertility of fields.</p>
<p>Mounds were often protected by illusionary magic which could charm trespassers or cause them to fall asleep . Living fey zealously guarded mounds and punished those who disturbed their kinsmens' eternal rest.</p>
