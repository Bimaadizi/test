<h2>History</h2>
<p>While going somewhere through the path between Aerhiot's Field and Salopar's Field with three oxen in the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Nuglar heard a tinkling sound, like bells. He believed it may have been a lamb with a toy bell placed there by Priests of the Mother, almost certainly Chauntea . He also considered the ringing sound may have been children playing with something. Shortly after, however, he saw a sparkling mist approach one of his oxen; reaching out to touch it, the mist made some of his arm disappear. Before he could scream, the mist flowed over him, and reduced him to bones that crumbled in the breeze. Unknown to him, that mist was the Slayer .</p>
