<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ingrath was serving as a guard at the House of the Unicorn, the royal home of Galadorna, in Nethrar, late in the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , when he and fellow guard Delver did some services for the seneschal. His last service involved personally burning scrolls , then mixing the ashes with a dust provided by the seneschal, and casting them into the moat. The seneschal then wiped away his memory of doing that and left him wandering, recalling youthful dalliances. The memory wipe was almost certainly because the seneschal sought to blunt the cruelties of the sorceress-queen of Galadorna, Dasumia , which strongly implied the scrolls were hers.</p>
<p>Later at the Goblet of Shadows , a local tavern, Ingrath and Daluth were propositioned by a disguised Dasumia into some ungentlemanlike evening activities She took them to a shrine of Bane hidden somewhere in the House of the Unicorn, where they were forced to participate in a deadly ritual. After being affected by some compulsion spell by Dasumia and whipping her until she was red and bloody, she noticed the seneschal, Elminster, hiding in the entrance. After issuing their challenges, Dasumia sent the mind-controlled guards against him. He used a spell to release them, but they were knocked out by the backlash of the unwinding magic.</p>
