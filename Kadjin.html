<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kadjin was an elf with sharp features and confident demeanor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1374 DR , Captain Lastri Kassireh and the Vigilant sailed from the Sword Coast to the nation of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula . Onboard the ship were several passengers, including Volothamp Geddarm who traveled to meet with a wealthy yuan-ti merchant, Sa'Sani . The voyage was cursed with bad luck and numerous strange occurrences. Food supplies were mysteriously spoiled; freshwater barrels ruptured; one of the crew, Kellen , got drunk and drowned; Volo almost got poisoned; and new ropes became frayed.</p>
<p>Kadjin's life ended when the string of strange occurrences culminated in a deadly storm. The Vigilant's shipwreck was washed ashore not far from the city of Samargol . Most sailors perished in the storm, while others were captured to be eaten by the Batiri .</p>
