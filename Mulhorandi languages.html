<p>The Mulhorandi languages were a sub-grouping of the Mulani languages and members of the Rauric languages family.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>This sub-grouping included the tightly related languages Mulhorandi and Thayan . Some scholars did not recognize these two languages as distinct and only recognized a single Mulhorandi language.</p>
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>The Mulhorandi languages were highly inflected, and word order was of only minor importance. The languages sounded thick and slow to speakers of many other languages.</p>
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>In their earliest forms, the Mulhorandi languages used a logographic system of writing, which included pictographs to represent concepts. Over the millennia, the written form of the languages were simplified yet still contained tens of thousands of pictographs. By the late 14 th century DR , speakers of Mulhorandi proper tended to use the Celestial alphabet instead, which was taught to them by the god Thoth , while those speaking Thayan utilized Infernal in their writing.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It has been theorized that priestly rituals played a strong role in the sound and cadence of these languages.</p>
