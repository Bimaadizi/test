<p>In the late 14 th century DR , these magic cloaks were a popular topic among the tall-tale spewing commoners at many tavern across the Sword Coast . Many of these stories were about some hapless nobles who spent a king's bounty on these cloaks so they could look at each other without revulsion. Even though popular among common folk, most bards considered these pandering tales to the tool of unskilled.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , two of the nymph cloaks were available for sale at the Seedy Tavern in the Neverwinter 's docks, sold for fourteen smuggler coins . Same year, a more potently enchanted nymph cloak was sold by Eltoora Sarptyl in the Many-Starred Cloak of Beorunna's Well .</p>
