<p>The Marlspire of Najara was a naga crown and major artifact given to the Najaran naga by the yuan-ti of the Hss'tafi tribe in Year of Netted Dreams, âˆ’320 DR as a symbol of loyalty. It was worn by Terpenzi and all successive kings through to the reign of Jarant .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Far from being a mere symbol of office, the Marlspire had powerful magical capabilities (some of which only functioned when it was worn by a reptile.) If a non-reptile wore the Marlspire , that creature found itself more vulnerable to the attacks of reptiles.</p>
<p>The Marlspire of Najara had the normal abilities of a naga crown , including the power to dominate all Scaled Ones and see through invisibility .</p>
<p>In addition to these properties, it gave its bearer the ability to control Terpenzi, the Guardian of Najara.</p>
