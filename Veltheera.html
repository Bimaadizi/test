<p>On the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , one of the night-dancing rites in which Veltheera participated under Qilué Veladorn was interrupted by the intrusion of Dove Silverhand , who joined their dance despite being a human . She sought the head priestess' aid with a drow infiltration of Scornubel , as she was a fellow Chosen of Mystra and another of the Seven Sisters ; Veltheera considered that granting her aid with Eilistraee's power was a sinful heresy, to which Qilué responded that she was loyal to Eilistraee and Mystra both.</p>
