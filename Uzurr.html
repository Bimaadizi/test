<p>Uzurr , also called the The City of Toiling Monks , was a city in Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14th century DR . Uzurr was a member of the Lapal League and one of the Cities of the Seabreeze . It was devoted to Ilmater , the Crying God.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay sprawling across three hilltops west of the Lapal Way , between Abreon and Lhazantal .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of the Shoon Imperium ( 27 – 450 DR ), Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr from Calimshan traveled to Lapaliiya and founded a walled monastery called the Cloister of St. Uzurr . In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, known simply as "Uzurr".</p>
<p>Yuan-ti purebloods began infiltrating Uzurr on Eleasias 1 , the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR with the aim of assassinating Abbot Kadar al Ilmater and stopping his research into curing tainted ones and broodguards .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was dominated by the Order, and ruled by the Abbot of St. Uzurr; this was Kadar al Ilmater circa 1373 DR . Like in other cities of Lapaliiya, Uzurr's civic deity was Ilmater and the people discouraged other faiths. Uzurr's relations with the other cities of Lapaliiya mimicked those of Ilmater with their respective deities. Uzurr was one of the five most powerful city-states of the Lapal League and contributed a representative to its Grand Council. In practice, the Overking of Lapaliiya needed the support of Uzurr, among the other five, to have decrees passed by the Grand Council.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>Uzurr and the Order cultivated, produced, and exported olives, wines , and assorted spices to support themselves.</p>
