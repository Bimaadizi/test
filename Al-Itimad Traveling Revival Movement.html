<p>Al-Itimad Traveling Revival Movement was a group of wandering ethoist priests in the coastal towns of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>This group differed from most ethoists organizations in that they chose to wander around the Land of Fate and spread the word of their god. By far, the vast majority of ethoists favored sedentary existences in their temples and mosques.</p>
<p>After decades of spreading their word, their activities ceased after the untimely death of their leader.</p>
