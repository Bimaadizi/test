<p>Evensong Tower was a temple dedicated to Milil located in Berdusk .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in the Castle Hill area, just east of the High Lady's Castle .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Temples to Milil were lofty cathedrals of magnificent craftsmanship and architecture. Specifically, Evensong Tower was reminiscent of fairytale castles: it was a big structure surmounted by many very tall and slender stone towers.</p>
<p>The towers topped by high-pointed conical roofs, and linked by a multitude of flying bridges. They were decorated with wooden parapets and with numerous many-hued banners. The bridges were known to be dangerous during high winds or icy winters, and the banners were attracted lightning during stormy weather.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The main chancel of the temple was surrounded by many antechambers, which hosted a variety of poetry, ballads and orations during revels. The chancel itself served as a place to dance and engage in conversation during those events.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Twice per tenday, Evensong Tower organized revels — evening parties dedicated to dance, music, and socializing. Local nobility and wealthy merchants attended those parties, viewing them as a battle of wit and a way to improve their social standing. Visitors to the city that wanted to attend had to seem rich or important enough to impress the clergymen guarding the gates, and had to donate a hefty fee — a rewarding effort, as those revels provided some of the best entertainment around.</p>
<p>During revels the temple rooms were filled with a variety of poetry, ballads, and stirring orations. The clergymen of the church also used magic such as legend lore and stone tell in order to recreate famous speeches of ages past.</p>
<p>No food was served to guests in the temple, but drinks such as mead and Halurskan wine were made and sold by the clergy.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Due to the hefty fee and costly drinks, revels were said to attract pickpockets in addition to regular guests.</p>
