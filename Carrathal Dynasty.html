<p>The Carrathal dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of Callidyrr in the Moonshae Isles . Although they were descended from the High Kings and Queens of the Cymrych Dynasty who ruled over all the Ffolk of the Isles, the Carrathals were regarded as mere figureheads by the Ffolk outside of Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Carrathals could trace their lineage all the way back to the legendary hero and first High King of Moonshae, Cymrych Hugh . However, many regarded him as more of a mythical than historical figure by the time of Carrathal rule.</p>
<p>The Carrathal dynasty began in the Year of the Animated Armor, 944 DR , with the reign of High King Niall , who was born as a prince to the Cymrych dynasty of High Kings. However, that dynasty was already in decline by the time of his birth owing to the loss of the Crown of the High King by his great-great-grandfather in a battle against the Northmen . The family's authority truly collapsed during the reign of his father , when the northern isles of Moonshae were ceded to the Northmen and the family's only remaining symbol of office, the Sword of Cymrych Hugh , was lost to firbolgs . Thus, when Niall took the throne at the family's seat in Caer Callidyrr , he did so as king of Callidyrr only. He changed the name of the family from "Cymrych" to "Carrathal", which was part of a general trend by the royal families of the Moonshaes to shift the spelling and pronunciations of their names to distance themselves from the mythical Cymrych Hugh name.</p>
<p>The Carrathals would rule Callidyrr for four centuries until the time of High King Reginald , who was betrayed and manipulated by his evil advisor, Cyndre , and ultimately deposed by the hero Tristan Kendrick in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR . Reginald's heir was a bastard son living in Amn named Brynth , but he had no viable claim to the throne after Tristan reclaimed both the Crown of the High King and the Sword of Cymrych Hugh for himself, establishing the Kendrick Dynasty . Nevertheless, Brynth's son and heir, Lionel , would go on to claim himself to be the rightful High King of the Moonshae Isles as late as the Year of the Halls Unhaunted, 1407 DR .</p>
