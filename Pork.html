It was bought and sold, both fresh and cured, in city markets like those in Ravens Bluff and Arabel .</p>
<p>Pork was a common food at inns in Faerûn, and was often served spicy in the south (such as in Tethyr ) and more mildly seasoned in the north (such as in Waterdeep).</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pork was a staple food in north Faerûn since the days of ancient Netheril .</p>
<p>High demand among the nobles of Chessenta made pork one of their most important imports as of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR owing to the fact that few pigs were raised in the realm itself.</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the merchant Alsimur Droon manufactured a shortage of salt pork along the Sword Coast , allowing him to capitalize on the desperate demand.</p>
<h2>Trivia</h2>
