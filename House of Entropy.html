<p>The House of Entropy was a temple dedicated to the worship of Entropy located within the city of Bezantur , Thay .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was located in northern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". It sat between Myulon's Inn and the city's Temple of Jergal .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple had no windows and only a single small door. The entire structure was jet black.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Sermons were delivered by a high priest, and preached against wizards and the use of magic . However, the Red Wizards were either conveniently omitted from these prohibitions or were claimed to be an exception to them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the temple's position as an anti- mage organization made its status in the Red Wizard-controlled city somewhat tentative. The identity of the House's high priest was unknown, and he wore black robes and a dark veil to conceal himself when delivering sermons.</p>
