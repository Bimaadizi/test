<p>Unlike its sister isles, Unglur had no surface ruins, and there were only a few sea caves that could be used for shelter or harborage. The island also lacked any freshwater springs. Vegetation was scarce and only consisted of thin shrubbery. Unglur had no harbors and just one anchorage at the center of the western shore, where the curved shore met with a snout. It was the only spot for boats to reach the beach despite strong blistering winds that pelted the shore. The winds made it almost impossible to un-beach any boats without the use of magic .</p>
