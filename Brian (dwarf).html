<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Brian and his fellow adventurers were hired by the Baldurian wizard Lorroakan to recover an artifact known as the Nightsong . To accomplish their mission, they served as guides to the archdruid , Master Halsin of the Emerald Grove , and made their way out to the Shattered Sanctum temple. But the powerful druid had a different goal: investigating strange goings-on related to mind flayer tadpole infections in the region.</p>
<p>The group was caught by the cult of the Absolute during their excursion. Brian was cut to pieces by the goblins and turned into a spit roast for their feast celebrating a successful assault on Waukeen's Rest . One of the goblins, Tracker Klagga , took all his belongings, including a pair of blue pants and some poetry written by the dwarf serving as a map leading to the Nightsong.</p>
