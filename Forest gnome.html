<p>Forest gnomes were among the least commonly seen gnomes on Toril , far shyer than even their deep gnome cousins. Small and reclusive, forest gnomes were so unknown to most non-gnomes that they had repeatedly been "discovered" by wandering outsiders who happened into their villages. Timid to an extreme, forest gnomes almost never left their hidden homes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Compared with other gnomes, forest gnomes were even more diminutive than their cousins, rarely growing taller than 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) in height or weighing in over 30 pounds (14 kilograms). Typically, males were slightly larger than females, at the most by four inches or five pounds. Unlike other gnomes, forest gnomes generally grew their hair long and free, feeling neither the need nor desire to shave or trim their hair much, though males often took careful care of their beards, trimming them to a fine point or curling them into hornlike spikes. Forest gnome skin was an earthy color and looked, in many ways, like wood, although it was not particularly tough. Forest gnome hair was brown or black, though it grayed with age, sometimes to a pure white. Like other gnomes, forest gnomes generally lived for centuries, although their life expectancy was a bit longer than was the case for either rock or deep gnomes; 400 was the average life expectancy of a forest gnome.</p>
<h2>Psychology</h2>
<p>Forest gnomes were painfully shy creatures who neither felt the need nor desire to interact with other races. For the most part, forest gnomes would simply like to be ignored as they had been for millennia. Unlike deep gnomes, this came less out of a general mistrust of outsiders and more out of an extreme sense of privacy and affinity for the natural world, combined with a general ambivalence about things that were outside of their experience. Among their own kind, forest gnomes were quite friendly, if not particularly lively.</p>
<p>Like deep gnomes, forest gnomes rarely left their remote homes. As a general rule, forest gnomes lacked the curiosity typical of most gnomes and would only leave their homelands under intense pressure, such as a threat that they alone could not overcome. For the most part, forest gnomes preferred to stick to what they knew—caring for the woods around them.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Forest gnomes differed from the more common rock gnomes and deep gnomes in a number of ways. Forest gnomes, like halflings , were adept at obscuring their presence and slipping into places unseen, particularly when in the familiar terrain of their forest homes. In addition to the cantrip -like abilities typical of gnomes, forest gnomes also possessed supernatural abilities similar to the spells pass without trace and speak with animals , and could use these abilities at will.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>Forest gnomes lived in an extreme state of primitivism, though their lives were generally comfortable and idyllic. Forest gnomes are largely hunter-gatherers, harvesting their food from wild fruits, nuts, and berries, and supplementing their diet with a little meat. Forest gnome villages were usually composed of less than a hundred members, who were often all a part of an extended family. Forest gnome homes were generally small, reclusive, and so well-hidden that a human might well walk within a few feet of a gnome home and not even realize it. Part of this was because of the unique manner in which forest gnomes constructed their homes, which were typically located within trees .</p>
<p>Forest gnomes spent the majority of their day tending to the forest and gathering food to feed the rest of the village, although a few, like their rock- and deep-gnome kin, searched underground for gems in a manner unusual for most hunter-gatherers. Forest gnome children who were too young to contribute were generally allowed to do as they liked, although they were prevented from wandering far from their protective parents. The children learned how to behave primarily by example, watching their elders, and acquired a reverence for the forest and appreciation for their society only gradually. Forest gnomes were generally organized in a loose gerontocracy , with the eldest member of the community serving an advisory role to the rest of the community, who generally only came to decisions by a consensus. Outside of their homes, this ideal carried on, although they rarely gathered in groups of more than two or three, when beyond their secluded villages.</p>
<p>Forest gnomes only rarely became adventurers , usually only due to some kind of serious threat to their homes or other such need that forced them to leave their reclusive hovels. Most forest gnomes were craftsmen or other kinds of experts . Those who did leave would take on a variety of different roles, unusual for their kind. The forest gnomes love of music resulted in many excellent, if somewhat shy, bards . Other forest gnomes became clerics or druids , who often played important roles in forest gnome society once they returned from adventuring. Very few forest gnomes would consider themselves proper warriors and forest gnome fighters were next to unheard of. On the other hand, many forest gnomes found themselves well-suited for the life of a rogue , given their small size and stealthy natures. Some forest gnomes also showed a propensity for the arcane arts and became, like so many of their more common kin, illusionists . Because of their historical conflict against kobolds , orcs , goblinoids , and reptilian humanoids , many had taken defensive training against these during their upbringing, something that served them well during their travels.</p>
<h2>Art and Leisure</h2>
<p>Forest gnome society, like that of most hunter-gatherers, was a curious mix of luxury and hard work. Forest gnomes spent most of their days working for the benefit of their community but after returning home from the forest, they would usually spend their time in a relaxed lifestyle with few causes of stress. During these times of leasure, forest gnomes devoted themselves to a variety of humble but impressive artistic practices. Among these were gem-cutting and jewelry-making, which forest gnomes, unlike the similarly primitive wild elves , had a deep fondness for. Typically these beautiful designs would reflect the natural world in a way most uncommon to other more civilized peoples. They also forged a wide variety of tools but had a notable taboo against axes , due to their use in woodcutting by other races.</p>
<p>Forest gnome architecture were quite unique. Like many of the Tel-quessir , forest gnomes made their homes in such a way as to disturb the local environment as little as possible. However, unlike elves , who often live in the branches of trees, weaving their architecture into the surrounding structures, forest gnomes would build their homes within trees, carving them in a careful manner devised by druids as to do as little harm to the living plant as possible. Each tree hovel would usually be a few hundred feet away from the others, allowing each family the privacy that nearly all forest gnomes craved. The homes themselves were usually made of several tiny rooms stacked on top of one another, with trapdoors and ladders connecting them. Each room was about 4 ft (1.2 m) tall and lined with windows as to let in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Because of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle forest gnomes neither kept neither livestock nor pets. However, forest gnomes were quite fond of wild animals and would sometimes forge bonds with these. Of the forest's wildlife, forest gnomes mostly prefered the company of creatures close to their own size, such as foxes and squirrels .</p>
<h2>Magic and Religion</h2>
<p>Like most gnomes, forest gnomes prefered the use of illusion to other schools of magic , which they embraced as a way to protect them and theirs from harm. Frequently, forest gnome illusionists would use their talents in concert with the more naturalistic camouflage that was part of forest gnome architecture, to hide their homes from outsiders. When forest gnomes were forced to deal with outsiders, they often delegated the task to the illusionists, who would conjure images of the intruders' own race as a form of communication that distanced the gnomes from their potential attackers.</p>
<p>Unlike other gnome peoples, forest gnomes also had a strong tradition of divine and primal magic . Clerics were well-respected among forest gnomes and typically offered their healing powers to help animals who had been injured by hunters or traps . Druids were also respected among forest gnomes, although forest gnomes were so shy that they rarely joined druidic circles of other races. Those that did, however, found their extroversion well-rewarded, as the addition power gained from such association helped to protect their forest homes.</p>
<p>Forest gnomes had a stronger sense of faith than any other gnome subrace, although it was often very different from that of the other gnomes, incorporating animistic traditions and a reverence for the natural world. Priests were often communal leaders, who helped to keep distant villages in touch with one another. When large numbers of forest gnomes gathered, priests of various types were usually there to bless the meetings.</p>
<p>Of all the gods , forest gnomes felt the closest to Baervan Wildwanderer , who was often associated with the very same wild places where forest gnomes resided. According to forest gnome tradition, Baervan had personally entrusted the care of the wilderness to his followers, a burden the forest gnomes were happy to accept, and clerics of the god often served as caretakers of the woodlands. Segojan Earthcaller was another popular god, and gnomes venerated his teachings to treat with respect and friendship the animals of the wild. As a way of showing their veneration for the god, the few forest gnome warriors incorporated grass and roots as part of their armor. Like most other gnomes, forest gnomes feared the influence of Urdlen , who represented unknown threats, for the large part though, the god would ignore the forest gnomes, as he seemed to appreciate their ways.</p>
<h2>Relations with Other Races</h2>
<p>Although forest gnomes were a shy and reclusive people they were not particularly resentful or untrusting of outsiders. Usually, it was more the case of the forest gnomes simply not caring about other races , but when they did meet outsiders they would often act in a friendly, if painfully timid manner. Given the chance, forest gnomes could become close and loyal friends of those who treated them with respect.</p>
<p>Of the other humanoid races, forest gnomes were most fond of rock gnomes , elves, and halflings of all types, with ghostwise halflings preferred among the latter. Forest gnomes got along particularly well with elves and ghostwise, due to both other races sharing similar homes as the forest gnomes. In regards to other races, forest gnomes usually did not care about them, though an exception was made for orcs, kobolds, and lizardfolk , whose harsh treatment of the woodlands marked them as natural enemies of the forest gnomes. Forest gnomes had a similar, but more amicable opinion of humans, due to the loggers, trappers, and hunters who all were part of most human civilizations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like other gnomes, forest gnomes rarely bothered to keep meaningful historical records. Anthropologists and historians postulated that the tiny people may have helped save forests throughout Toril from overlogging and other forms of destruction but there were no concrete proof of these efforts. For their part, forest gnomes of various villages often marked years by important events, good or bad, that befell their community, but these events were rarely significant on a larger scale and meant little to outsiders.</p>
<h2>Homelands</h2>
<p>Forest gnomes were a rare sight, but they were not particularly uncommon. In addition to inhabiting their ancestral homelands in the Feywild , forest gnomes could be found in Aglarond , the Great Dale and the Spiderhaunt Wood . Wherever they lived, they were well-hidden and so often unnoticed, sometimes for centuries, by their neighbors.</p>
