<p>A bag of holding was a magical item , often a small sack, that acted as an opening to an extradimensional space. The space inside the bag could hold a huge amount of materials without increasing the weight of the bag.</p>

<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A typical bag of holding could hold up to 500 pounds (230 kilograms) of material that did not exceed a volume of 64 cubic feet (1.8 cubic meters), although other types with different capacities existed. The bag also allowed a few of minutes of breathing air for creatures that could enter it. It could sustain temporarily a breathing creature for up to 10 minutes. A password could be set to secure the contents.</p>
