<p>Swamp beetles were a species of giant beetles found in the Mere of Dead Men on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Swamp beetles were large flat-bodied insects with green carapaces and two big hard mandibles at the front of their mouths.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Swamp beetles were mostly docile and only attacked if undesirable creatures approached them or provoked the insects.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>This beetle species was a common sight in the Mere of Dead Men. The creatures were carrion and decaying vegetation feeders, often consuming and building nests in piles of carrion and offal. Lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men learned to domesticate swamp beetles using them for hunting and defending of their homes.</p>

<p>Lizardfolk who served black dragons Waervaerendor and Voaraghamanthar circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , had several swamp beetles inhabiting the Dragon Caves , once a cavernous shrine to Tyr .</p>
