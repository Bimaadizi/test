<p>The Wall of Fallen Djinn was a range of mountains and foothills found in The Sword region of southern Anauroch .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They appeared as a literal wall of brown rock earth that rose above the desert floor.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Located in the center of The Sword, the Wall of Fallen Djinn was situated between three great landmarks of the region: the Hills of Scent to the north, the Shoal of Thirst to the east, and the Saiyaddar to the south.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Wall's foothills of the range were intercut by brush-covered ravines.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The slopes of the mountains were mottled with copses of qassis and acacia trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of Netheril the range was known as the Shinantra Mountains after a group of elusive hairy humanoids that inhabited the range since before humans arrived. They were believed to have perished with the encroachment of the desert after the fall of Netheril. Both the Cede River and the Dahla River flowed from the peaks into the Hidden Lake .</p>
<p>An ancient battle between the Bedine tribespeople and a group of djinn was the source of the mountains' unique name. According to Bedine lore, every member of the tribe died while fighting off the djinn, managing to slay a score of the otherworldly beings – a deed that was wholly inconceivable until that point.</p>
