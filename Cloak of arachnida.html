<p>Cloaks of arachnida were enchanted cloaks that granted the wearer abilities of a spider .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cloaks of arachnida were black mantles that emanated a strong aura of alteration magic. They were often decorated with silken patterns of webs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The wearers of these cloaks were granted the continual effects of the spider climb spell , allowing them to scale any surface, rendering them completely immune to the web spell, and unrestrainable by any mundane webs. Additionally, the wearer was able to create a magical web , double the size of such a web conjured via spell. Lastly, the wearer became resistant to any arachnid venom or poison .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Spiderstone golems were imbued with magics that lingered on their bodies after the constructs were destroyed. As such, remnants of spiderstone golems could be used in crafting and enchanting of spider-related magic items, including cloaks of arachnida . A skilled crafter of magic items could recreate a cloak of arachnida using spider climb and web spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the so-called King of Spiders Sirachna gained entrance to a home on Westgate 's Market Triangle from a cavern underneath. His arachnid pets ended up murdering a family who lived inside, leaving them haunting the home as restless ghosts . Some said the King of Spiders was killed by an adventurer, accompanied by Charissa Maernos , Mantides , and Rinara , who claimed his cloak of arachnida and several other magic items.</p>
