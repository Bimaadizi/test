<p>The Stoneclubs were a band of ogre raiders operating in Thar in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Stoneclubs' tactics were notably more cunning and intelligent than was usually expected of a marauding band of ogres. This was thanks to their leader, an ogre mage who was presumed to be a member of the Kur-Tharsu .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The tribe resided in an abandoned Thentian guard tower north of the Moonsea coast. From there, they struck at passing caravans traveling the Sword Trail connecting Thentia to Melvaunt to capture prisoners and goods.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century, the band sacked a caravan owned by the Double Moon Coster , capturing several merchants. The Coster promptly hired adventurers to save the captives and to exact revenge on the Stoneclubs.</p>
