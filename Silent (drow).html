<p>Silent was a drow agent who investigated Graz'zt 's schemes in Tethyamar during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Silent had a large white tattoo on his face, wore a suit of plate and carried twin scimitars .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was quite restrained and careful, and avoided needless bloodshed. He also did not worship Lolth .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Silent was a skilled and deadly warrior. He was mute , and knew a form of sign language with which to communicate. When with those who did not know his language, he had to rely on gestures and pantomime, or his companion's telepathy .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was quite fond of his friend and fellow agent Zoraxzil , and served as his bodyguard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Graz'zt began causing chaos and destruction with his jewels of ardor in Tethyamar, a third party hired Silent and Zoraxzil to investigate and find the source of the problem. Although they managed to track down Graz'zt's lair, they found themselves trapped in the stereotypical illusion of Faraway , being menaced by demons disguised as human villagers. Silent and Zoraxzil were separated, and a band of (hopefully) cunning heroes shortly after entered the illusion in pursuit of Graz'zt, who had taken the form of Silent just before disappearing. To make things worse, the false villagers told the newcomers that Silent was a murderous drow invader set on destroying the village. Though his fate seemed dark, Silent may have been able to use hand gestures to signal his non-aggression and work with the others to foil Graz'zt's flat and uninspired storytelling and railroaded plot.</p>
