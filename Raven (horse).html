<p>Raven was a horse belonging to Vala Thorsdotter in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Raven was a large and strong black stallion. He completed Vala's all-black ensemble, which included her black cloak , black scale armor , and black darksword .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Raven was descended from Sable , a mare of which Melegaunt Tanthul had apparently been quite fond from his one-year stay with the Moor Eagle tribe of Vaasa in the Year of the Moat, 1269 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Raven was taken to Evereska as part of Vala's force of twenty mounted warriors who departed the Granite Tower to heed Melegaunt's summons, as per a pact made by her great-grandfather, Bodvar . Once there, he was given to Melegaunt to ride into the elven city, and the wizard quickly formed a bond with Raven such that he was confident that the horse would return to him if summoned.</p>
