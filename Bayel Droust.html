<p>Bayel Droust was a scholar and scribe from Impiltur . He was sent by the Grand Council in 1399 DR on an expedition to map the post- spellplague coastline of the Sea of Fallen Stars . The ship he was travelling on, the Grayling , was attacked and sunk by Cealynna near the island of Prespur . Bayel possessed two books written by the Shou monk Liou Chang that described how to open teleporation gates. Cealynna wanted the spells so she could return to the Feywild so she imprisoned Bayel in her undersea domain for eighty years where he was forced to work at breaking the code used by Liou Chang. Bayel was rescued by the monk Kwan Shang-Li in 1479 DR .</p>
