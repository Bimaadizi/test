<p>Lord Halueth Never was a sun elf warrior of Iliyanbruen and an early founder of the city of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Embrace, −15 DR , the rulers of Illusk developed dreams of empire and began expanding to both the east and the south. However, in only three years , they were confronted by the elves of Iliyanbruen to the south. Halueth Never became prominent as a warrior in their battles. Finally, in the Year of Burning Glades, −10 DR , Halueth led the elves of Iliyanbruen to defeat the forces of Illusk and finally put a halt to Illuskan expansion southward, though skirmishing between their sides would continue.</p>
<p>It was said that he had to overcome many trials and hardships in his later life. He occupied a keep that came to be part of Castle Never , leading to the founding of Neverwinter proper (at the time known as Eigersstor) in the Year of the Hoar Frost, 87 DR .</p>
<p>Lord Halueth was served by nine knights— Talven , Galavren , Floashebel , Thracier (who turned traitor), Shoce , Coneth , N'halien , Tamper , and Slade —upon whom the later Neverwinter Nine knighthood would be based. For his knights, Halueth had crafted nine enchanted swords of alchemical silver , after which the Ceremonial Sword of Neverwinter used to induct new members of the Nine would be copied.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>He was said to be interred in a tomb under Castle Never . According to local legend, he lay on a massive slab of stone and was ringed by twelve unsheathed swords of different kinds, their points outward. The swords were magical and never rusted nor decayed, but would animate and attack all trespassers. Only by following exactly the instructions inscribed on the flagstones in cryptic verses could one avoid having to fight them. If defeated, the animating spell was broken and they became ordinary swords that could be retrieved.</p>
<p>Halueth was briefly mentioned in The Leadership of Neverwinter and priests at the Hall of Justice temple of Tyr in the late 14 th century would seek his tomb, though the Wailing Death ended their efforts in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . That year, on Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar 's behalf, the Hero of Neverwinter potentially explored four prospective 'Never Tombs' around the city, retrieving the Ancient Chronicles of Halueth Never from one in the Great Cemetery, among other relics. Finally, the Hero would come across what seemed to be Halueth Never's tomb itself, not beneath Castle Never but behind a secret passage in a house in the Blacklake District , and would have to get past only four attacking animated 'Swords of Never' to reach the sarcophagus. This held Halueth's rusted armor, which would be a valued treasure of Neverwinter if recovered.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the dark forces of the King of Shadows infiltrated Castle Never and attacked all within. The castle's defenders sealed off its various sections, unfortunately dividing its defenders. But in this time of need, the castle's Neverneath opened to allow the Kalach-Cha and companions through. By answering questions of Neverwinter and swearing loyalty to the city, or else defeating the Guardians of Neverneath, the Kalach-Cha reached the true tomb of Lord Halueth Never, with his undecayed body still lying in repose on a bier and ringed by eight statues representing the first Neverwinter Nine—the ninth was absent—as well as their nine floating magical swords. The successful visitor was invited to take the place of the ninth, thus marking them as a future member of the Neverwinter Nine, and being granted a magical sword, Blessing of the Daystar . Furthermore, the body held the Rod of Never so that it might be bequeathed to the future Lord of Castle Never; it also controlled the castle's magical defenses. The Kalach-Cha reached Lord Nasher Alagondar , gave him the Rod of Never , and was knighted as one of the Neverwinter Night.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halueth Never wore a fine suit of plate mail armor. Though later found badly rusted, it was etched with designs including the holy symbol of Tyr.</p>
