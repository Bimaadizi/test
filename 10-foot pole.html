<p>10-foot poles and their variants were staple dungeon -delving tools for adventurers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As befitting their name, 10-foot poles were often 10 feet (3 meters) long. While this made them useful, they were also quite cumbersome and bulky, especially in tight spaces such as dungeons.</p>
<p>The collapsible pole was a more complex and handy variant, which took the form of a 2‑foot (0.61‑meter) pole that could telescope out to 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 feet (3.7 meters) long, then locked in place. A second pole could also be attached to the first, creating a single pole up to 22 feet (6.7 meters) long.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Wooden poles and staves were simple to make, and were commonly made on lathes by woodworking shops such as Gullaxe's Stairs, Rails, Poles, Staves and Handles .</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Poles could be used to jam doors open, pass items over gaps, extend the reach of magnets or other attachments, and do anything else a creative utilitarian could imagine. They were also used to tap or prod at suspected traps , a feature especially valued by adventurers that delved into dungeons. They made a good companion to more-complex thieves' tools .</p>
<p>A solid 10-foot or longer pole could serve as a vaulting pole, and allowed very long or high jumps. A good pole could also serve as an improvised climbing surface, similar to a rope , or be used to construct a simple ladder .</p>
<p>Small boats such as rafts , skiffs , and barges could be propelled through shallow waters via pole, rather than by sail or oar .</p>
<p>Many useful tools were made from poles with a specialized attachments. These included pitchforks , brooms , shovels , hoes , rakes , gaffs , oars , and fishing rods .</p>
<p>Pole arms were essentially poles with deadly implements attached on the end to turn them into long-reaching weapons. Simplified further, a solid pole could be made into a quarterstaff , and served as a handy bludgeon.</p>
