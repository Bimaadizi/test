<p>Cedra was a yuan-ti half-breed leader and sorceress who allied with the Legion of the Chimera .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The yuan-ti who served Yxunomei captured and raped the women of Kuldahar . Nine months after their rescue, these women gave birth. All the children were girls, all with smooth green skin, pitch-black hair, and the golden eyes of serpents. Among these daughters was Cedra. The men of Kuldahar were furious and couldn't contain their rage. The church of Ilmater tried to intervene, but they were ran out of town. The mothers carried their half-breed children to the only nearby place that would accept them, Dragon's Eye .</p>
<p>The angry villagers were planning to storm Dragon's Eye, but the arch druid Iselore had returned. He dissuaded the villagers from this plan, and let the mothers and their yuan-ti half-breed children be free. Cedra became their leader and represented the half-blood yuan-ti.</p>
<p>Years later, despite Iselore's mercy, Cedra aligned with The Legion of the Chimera, an evil organization that sought justice for half-breeds. The legion's co-leader, Madae , as well as Cedra, marched their army towards Kuldahar, and launched an attack. Many of the yuan-ti half-breeds formed a contingent and followed their commander, Cedra. Cedra was left to command the army, as Madae had other matters to attend to.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, Cedra and the legion's army fell to Iselore and a party of adventurers.</p>
