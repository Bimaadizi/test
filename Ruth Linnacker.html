<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ruth Linnacker was an aging human woman with a dark skin tone. Her long finely-braided hair was bleached by the woman's advancing age. She wore embroidered finery â€“ a long teal gambeson.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lady Ruth Linnacker was already a member of the Parliament of Peers. When the Absolute crisis arrived at the Gate, Ruth was noted by the Cult of Bane as one of the eight top patriars of the Parliament, vulnerable to bribery, blackmail, or direct threats. Lady Linnacker became a target of the cult when a large amount of payments from the family's Tethyrian gem mines was made public. Her granddaughter, Fariza Linnacker , was to be captured and held hostage in the Upper City until Ruth compiled with the Baneites' demands.</p>
<p>The stunt was an apparent successes as Lady Linnacker voted to crown the lowborn Lord Enver Gortash as the Gate's Archduke. She was present at the Wyrm's Rock fortress, along with her fellow Parliamentarians during the coronation. Publicly, Ruth proclaimed Gortash as being a man of the people.</p>
