<p>Garrick was a bard who traveled across west Faerûn during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was somewhat naive and too trusting of strangers. He enjoyed traveling and performing his music for others.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garrick honed his musical talents studying at a college in Berdusk .</p>
<p>He was once part of the Dale Wind Troubadours , a traveling acting troupe who performed all along the Sword Coast, from Amn in the south to Neverwinter in the north. Although the Troubadours were a popular act who regularly performed for the higher classes, they also used their performances as distractions for theft. When Garrick learned of this he left the troupe in protest.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Garrick had taken up with actor and ne'er-do-well Silke Rosena in Beregost . After the iron crisis he became romantically infatuated with Alyth Elendara , and regularly stayed at the Elfsong Tavern in Baldur's Gate .</p>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR Garrick moved south to Athkatla in Amn , where he tried courting a paladin of the Order of the Radiant Heart . Like Lady Alyth, she rebuffed his advances.</p>
