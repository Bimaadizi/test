<p>Commander Ophael was a marilith demon summoned by the Red Wizards of Thay in Myth Drannor during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ophael was summoned by the forces of Droic Orgul to support their armed forces in the Cult of the Dragon base while they performed rituals to subvert and control the dracolich Karliath . When intruders breached the base, Ophael and her minion vrocks engaged them inside a large ritual chamberâ€”and when defeated and banished to the Abyss , the demons reappeared near-instantly to continue the fight, to Ophael's delight. Only by exploiting flaws in the chamber were some of the intruders able to escape the fight and reach the team of gray slaadi that maintained the constant demonic summoning, allowing Ophael to finally be defeated and sent away for good, leaving behind her prized cincture .</p>
