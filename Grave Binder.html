<p>The Grave Binder was a longtooth dagger found on the Sword Coast during the mid-to-late-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Grave Binder , like other longtooth daggers, was identifiable by its unusually long blade. The weapon was heavier than a normal dagger, and required greater strength to wield.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The dagger was uncovered several years before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR by a band of adventurers to the south of the Sword Coast, however the owners of the weapon remained oblivious to its magics for years after the discovery. Subsequently, the adventurers delved into lore tomes and rediscovered the weapon's enchantment and extensive history in the hands of assassins . This led to the dagger being named the Grave Binder . However, soon after, the Binder was stolen and found its way to northwest Faerûn .</p>
<p>In 1368 DR, the Grave Binder ended up in the hands of the assassin only known as Krystin from Baldur's Gate 's Undercellar . She was hired by the infamous Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev to end the life of his brother Abdel Adrian . The same year, the dagger was said to have been wielded by Tellan , the self-appointed shining light of Tethyr , during his time trapped on a mysterious ice island.</p>
