<p>Fezzerk was the leader of a goblin war band associated with the cult of the Absolute during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The goblin boss was all bluster and bravado until he was knocked down a peg or two. He became something of a coward whenever confronted with violence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point during or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Fezzerk and the professional torturer Spike encountered the adventurer Wyll , apparently when he was still a captain in the Flaming Fist . During the encounter, Spike ended up plucking out Wyll's right eye, keeping it as a trophy for some time.</p>
<p>Some time later, Fezzerk and his band ventured over to Moonhaven . There they tortured the Baldurian deep gnome Barcus Wroot , by tying him to the arm of the village's windmill and laughed as they watched him spin around again and again.</p>
