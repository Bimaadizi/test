<p>The Axe of the Bear King was a unique greataxe of Rashemi make, created sometime long before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The iron weapon was crudely crafted but surrounded by an aura of powerful magic. Its ceremonial purpose was obvious from the fact that no bear telthor could actually wield an axe.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This greataxe was enhanced with a powerful +4 enchantment that dealt additional damage and guided the wielder's arm towards the foe. Despite its crude appearance, it was ensorcelled with the keen enchantment that kept the axe's blade sharp and deadly. Additionally, the axe of the Bear King discharged a burst of magical electricity with every successful attack.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The axe of the Bear King was a gift from the Witches of Rashemen to Okku , the great bear spirit. The weapon was stored within a burial burrow in Rashemen, north of the city of Mulsantir , where the great spirit Okku rested until the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR .</p>
