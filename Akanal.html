<p>The Akanal , also known as the Akanul and the Akanul Plains , was a stretch of land in southwestern Chessenta , famed as being among the most fertile farmland anywhere in the Realms .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Akanal comprised the peninsula between the Akanamere 's western and southern arms and the lands around the lake's southern shore. The east and south were bordered by the Hills of Maerth .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , the settlements of the Akanal paid tribute to the city-state of Akanax on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The Akanal boasted incredibly fertile and productive farmland, and was the best in Chessenta and the Old Empires and among the finest in all of Faerûn . The lands around the Akanamere were planted with cash crops in large plantations. Their produce was shipped to Akanax and Soorenar , and from there to Airspur , Cimbar , and Reth , and all in all provided more than half of Chessenta's food supply.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Akanal and surrounding foothills were the prehistoric homeland of the Turami people whilst they were still tribal hunter-gatherers.</p>
<p>Two decades after its founding around −5800 DR , the empire of Jhaamdath maintained outposts in the Akanal, marking its easternmost edge. After its southern and western expansion was halted in −5005 DR , Jhaamdath pushed east into the Akanal, meeting and absorbing the Turami there as an underclass of laborers and field hands.</p>
<p>In −1504 DR , the forces of Unther broke through Jhaamdath's Akana frontier and, by −1499 DR , they controlled the Akanal and the empire's eastern half. This continued until a Jhaamdathan counterattack in −1069 DR , and it remained a Jhaamdathan possession until the empire's collapse in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR .</p>
<p>By the mid–14 th century DR , the lands of the Akanal had been cultivated for hundreds of years, and they had been fought over just as long. In fact, a good number of the conflicts fought in Chessenta were actually waged over control of the Akanal and access to its produce.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>It was ringed by the towns of Gaj , Villon , and Oslin .</p>
