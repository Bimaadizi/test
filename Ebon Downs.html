<h2>History</h2>
<p>Historically, the Ebon Downs served as a burial site for the inhabitants of the village of Grimhollow .</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR , a Netherese necromancer known as Idris made pacts with a number of wights within the cemetery known as the Barrow Lords to form an army capable of striking against Thay and to lay siege to the Sword Coast . With the help of a powerful artifact called Deathknell , he raised many undead from this site that went on to overwhelm Grimhollow, adding more to their ranks.</p>
<p>News of the rising undead eventually reached Lord Neverember , who proceeded to dispatch a contingent of the Neverwinter Guard to counter the threat. That contingent flew the banner of Kelemvor and was led by a doomguide named Vesper Soulhearth . They fought bravely, but being ill-prepared the contingent ultimately fell at the hands of the Barrow Lords. Only Vesper managed to survive and flee to a nearby temple to Kelemvor for safety. Later Lord Neverember would task a group of adventurers to travel down to the Ebon Downs in search of Vesper and her lost contingent.</p>
<p>When those adventurers arrived, they found that the Barrow Lords were assaulting the temple of Kelemvor with a horde of bone golems and zombies .</p>
