<p>Silk was a rebellious drow leader of a famous all-female adventuring troupe of seven – the Company of the Swanmays , active in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Silk was a drow woman with her black skin tinted with purple and her black hair – streaked with silver. She was very young for an elf. Like other Swanmays, Silk bore the group's mark – the tattoo of a stylized swan on the back of the hand.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Silk had a commanding presence and called herself a rebel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Much of Silk's personal life and history before joining the Swanmays remained a mystery. Under her leadership, the adventuring company often adventured around Suzail , the Dalelands , and surrounding regions. When they earned their living by guarding and guiding trader caravans through Cormanthor , they often passed through Shadow Gap and stayed in the North Gate Inn . When seasons changed, they spent their winters in Shadowdale , enjoying the warm company and strong drinks with Jhaele Silvermane at the Old Skull Inn .</p>
<p>Even though Alias' false memories suggested the adventuring group to be long-disbanded, they were very much still active, as in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Silk and the Swanmays aided the adventuring party possessing the Azure Bonds to kill Dracandros , a Red Wizard who took over the village of Hap in Cormyr. Silk encountered the said group of adventurers in Hap and offered them a reward for slaying one of Dracandros's black dragons and acquiring a dragon's egg from a dracolich 's lair. Were the adventurers female, Silk would offer them a membership in the Swanmays. However, it was unknown if they accepted the offer.</p>
<p>A few years later, the Swanmays found themselves captured by a group of drow after they spent a night at Zhentil Keep . The drow occupied the city, holding hostage some of the citizens and all the Swanmays members but Silk. To the residents of Zhentil Keep's dismay, the drow were allowed to run amok as the leaders of the keep turned a blind eye to it all. The reason behind the abductions was that one of Bane 's three lieutenants, the marilith Kaliste , was using the abductees as sacrifices. Silk managed to recruit heroes from Phlan to aid her in the rescue mission into the depths of Manshoon 's dungeon. Silk and adventurers discovered that the goodly hostages were siphoned off of their life force to create the essence of pure light , used to transform giant spiders into grotesque and powerful pets of Kalistes . One of the missing party members of Silk's was Cynthia , who was forced into magical servitude by Kaliste.</p>
