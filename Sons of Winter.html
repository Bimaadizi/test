<p>The Sons of Winter was a primordial cult dedicated to Cirotralech that operated out of the Fimbrul in Laerakond .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1480 DR , the Sons of Winter were founded by the scholar Rathloff , who had been corrupted by Pyrultimus , in order to awaken the primordial Cirotralech.</p>
<p>To fulfill their goals, Rathloff and his followers raided the ruins of Darkturret in Gontal , searching for powerful magic items . This alerted Queen Imreera Hethkantan of their existence, and the Queen quickly assembled a group of adventurers to deal with the cultists.</p>
<p>The adventurers faced the Sons in Fimbrul, where they were conducting foul rituals to unleash Cirotralech, having previously released the Bride , Cirotralech's consort. The adventurers were able to stop the ritual and kill all the Sons, but is uncertain whether or not they could stop them unleashing Cirotralech.</p>
<h2>Membership</h2>
