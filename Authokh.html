<p>An authokh (OTH-awk ) was a coin minted in Chessenta and commonly used in the region of Faerûn that included the Border Kingdoms , Tashalar , the Vilhon Reach , and lands to the south of these. It was accepted at its full value (five gold pieces ) in places like Amn , Scornubel , and Westgate , but was not recognized in Cormyr , Sembia , the Dalelands , the Dragon Reach , the Moonsea , the Sword Coast , or Tethyr . In Waterdeep and Calimshan , it was worth one silver piece .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Early authokhs were square with a small hole in the center for stringing together on a leather lace or the like. The design on one side was twelve leaves arranged in a ring that surrounded the hole. The image on the reverse was twelve daggers arranged in a ring with tips pointing outward. After she became a war hero, the authokh was minted with a bust of Shala Karanok wearing a crown on the obverse, and the burning brand of House Luthcheq on the reverse.</p>
<p>The coin was stamped from "delmed" silver—an alloy of silver, copper and other bright metals in exact proportions, giving it a translucent green tint with a surface that would not take a polish like other metal coins.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This coin was originally minted long ago in a city somewhere in Chessenta, but the name of the city has been forgotten. Back then, it had a value of twelve gold pieces, but has since been revalued at five gold pieces. As of the reign of Shala Karanok, the Chessentan mint was in Luthcheq . The authokh and its sibling, the bebolt , were used instead of the platinum piece as a convenient trading currency by merchants who traveled extensively in the region.</p>
