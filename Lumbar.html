<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lumbar was wrapped in rags, his face hidden under a hood and a scarf. Lumbar's sickly yellow skin and stench of decay betrayed his undead zombie nature. Like other zombies, however, he was fully conscious and possessed undead fortitude and resistance to all types of physical damage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lumbar could be seen in an alleyway in the Lower City near the Basilisk Gate . The zombie made coin by allowing people to hit him. A single punch cost them 15 gold pieces.</p>
