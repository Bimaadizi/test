<p>The Church of Loviatar ( pronounced : / l oʊ ˈ v i ɑː t ɑːr / loh-VEE-a-tar ) was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of Loviatar , the Maiden of Pain. Limited in number, the Loviatans ( pronounced : / l aʊ ˈ v i ɑː t ɑː n s / low-VEE-a-tans ) nonetheless maintained a disproportionate amount of power and influence across Faerûn . The church was especially prevalent in the south-eastern nation of Dambrath —ruled by a high priestess of the faith—where the worship of Loviatar had long been the state religion.</p>
<p>Occasionally referred to in older sources as Lovites ( pronounced : /ˈ l oʊ v aɪt s / LOH-vites ), the priesthood was historically dominated by women of human or half-elven descent in both number and hierarchical standing. A disposition towards sadism and cruelty was characteristic of the clergy of Loviatar, who enjoyed inflicting pain upon others and subjecting themselves to it. Their violence was not indiscriminate, however, for the Faith of Pain was highly structured and organized, abiding by a system of strict rules.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The priesthood of Loviatar was regimented into a variety of roles, each of which influenced the duties they were assigned. Much of the quotidian work at an urban shrine or temple was assigned to clerics , who composed the majority within the ranks of the Loviatans. The punishment of transgressors, escorting of prisoners, and safety of the higher-ranked priestesses were instead the responsibility of the scourge maidens , themselves clerics of the Faith that had shown exceptional dedication.</p>
<p>Always the first to fight for the sake of their temples, these women tended to collaborate in groups alongside fellow scourge maidens, but they were also known to join adventuring companies or even depart on divine missions by themselves. Other clerics instead preferred the path of the painteacher , who behaved akin to an inquisitor. Distinguished by the sheer, black gauze they draped themselves in, these members of the clergy had nothing but contempt for weakness or fear.</p>
<p>Their duty was to purify, killing anyone they found wanting. This included those who reveled in pain without requiting it and those who were simply afraid of it, but the painteachers—and Loviatans as a whole—could leverage a grim respect for those who received pain unwaveringly, even if they were worshipers of other powers.</p>
<p>Functioning in a separate branch from the clerics were the specialty priests known as pains , as well as the maidens of pain , who lived itinerant lifestyles. Widely traveled, they were responsible for upholding and enacting the desires of the Willing Whip. Much like the painteachers, both could be given inquisitorial duties, but they were just as likely to be covert operatives or simple envoys.</p>
<p>Although their hierarchy divided them, the pains were regarded with high esteem by the clerical majority, for the former were often instruments of their goddess' punitive will. At any temple or shrine, one to three of these specialty priests could be convened by the clerics. The maidens of pain, on the other hand, were originally chosen from within the clergy's elite, being women so obsessed with spreading suffering that they became addicted to a drug known as agony .</p>
<p>Beyond these, the Church of Pain also had a place for mystics and monks . The former were usually seen alongside small companies of pains, but the latter group kept to themselves, living in an abbey or monastery occupied only by other monks. Nevertheless, these abbeys were part of the church hierarchy, which often attached them to a temple that they pledged their allegiance to.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>To make even clearer their hierarchy, the Loviatans also employed a number of different titles amongst each other. The lowest were known as "Kneeling Ones", referring to the laity or those who were still new to the faith, but many more were used to refer to confirmed members of the clergy. In ascending order, these were "Taystren", "Adept", "Sister" or "Brother", "Supremar", "Caressor", "Whiplass" or "Whiplar", "Paingiver", "Whipmistress" or "Whipmaster", and "High Whipmistress" or "High Whipmaster".</p>
<p>Some of these titles also had longer, more formal names, used rarely outside of official documentation, disciplinary hearings, or rituals . In such cases, an "Adept" was instead an "Adept in Pain", a "Sister" or "Brother" appended "in Torment" to their title, and a "Caressor" became a "Caressor of Terrors".</p>
<p>Two additional titles were reserved for those Loviatans who had distinguished themselves uniquely in their service to the Patroness of Torturers: "Branded" and "Truescar". Only the former had an extended rank in formal circumstances, becoming a "Branded of the God".</p>
<p>The first was used to refer to any members of the Faith of Pain who had reached the pinnacle of their local hierarchy, becoming the head of an abbey, monastery, or temple. The second was instead used for all Loviatans who had adopted a life of itinerancy—frequently heading or sponsoring companies of dark, like-minded adventurers —and spread suffering to extend Loviatar's influence across Faerûn.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In those degenerate cities that the Church of Loviatar flourished in, multiple nights and days were spent in debauched revelry, recruiting members from either extreme of society. Be they the lowest beggars, who starved for anything, or the bored rich, who starved for nothing, many were known to attend these events, indulging in the drugged wine on offer and the flesh of other pleasure seekers, both through dance and other, more carnal, activities.</p>
<p>One of the ways that Loviatans instilled a sense of discipline in their lesser members was by making them fulfill their tasks in a manner that was deliberately painful or unnecessarily arduous, inuring them to agonies that would have broken someone of weaker faith. Salt , by the handful, was often rubbed into the wounds inflicted or suffered by members of the clergy, and the faithful were often left heavily scarred by their worship, from past injuries they or their superiors dealt upon them.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, certain Loviatans, driven by their own restlessness or boredom, were known to enter taverns and intentionally provoke people into public, violent altercations. However, this was far from common behavior among the faithful. The clergy knew and feared that such overt disruptions, especially in civilized areas, could lead to the persecution of the faith's adherents or its outlawing—as well as the death of the Loviatan instigator.</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>Given their reputation and that of their goddess , Loviatans found that going out in public, even alone during the dark of night, could lead to conflict. Followers of other deities, those aligned with good , were known to ambush them, and even the occasional dock worker or sailor attempted to pull them into a drunken brawl. The faithful of Loviatar, for this reason, were warned to be vigilant, and they developed a habit of always praying for spells to use in battle each time they left their sanctuaries.</p>
<p>The Loviatans also observed a twice-daily ritual, wherein a single, deliberate strike of the whip upon themselves was followed by kneeling prayer. This simple process took place once in the morn, and once at night, but only during the first did they pray to receive their spells.</p>
<h2>Celebrations</h2>
<p>Some of the most common celebrations observed by the Faith of Pain were the Candle Rites . These traditional revels occurred every dozen nights, with the Loviatans circling lit candles in a dance, all the while chanting, praying, or singing. Throughout the rite, clergy were intended to repeatedly pass parts of their own bodies over or through the open flames, until the presiding priestess poured consecrated wine over her candle, extinguishing it.</p>
<h3>Seasonal</h3>
<p>Though not as frequently celebrated, the Rite of Pain and Purity was more sacred than the Candle Rite, and served as the Church of Pain's way to honor the four seasonal festivals. Given its greater importance, the former took precedence if ever the two celebrations fell on the same date. As part of the Rite, the laity were instructed to drum a rhythm accompanying the clergy's ringed dance, which they staged upon thorns, broken crystal, shattered glass, or even barbed wire . Much like the Candle Rite, the priesthood sang and chanted as they spun, but they were further encouraged by their more experienced fellows, whose duty it was to whip the dancers.</p>
<p>Over the course of the Rite of Pain and Purity, a crimson glow slowly rose over the ceremony, eventually gathering into an unsteady cloud above the circle. Notably, this served as a chance for the faithful to directly manifest the Maiden of Pain. For half of an hour, the celebration continued, during which time Loviatar could appear at the center of the cloud to express dissatisfaction, display her favor, or simply to pass on a mission of divine importance. Otherwise, if the time passed without her arrival, the celebration was ended, allowing the Loviatans the chance to heal and tend to their wounds.</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>In any fight, Loviatans were fearsome presences. Owing to the unyielding discipline instilled in them by their faith, they became so indifferent to pain that even the most severe of injuries—be they lost limbs or deathly wounds—had no effect on their composure or decision-making. Unshaken by fear of injury or disfigurements, the devotees of Loviatar faced their opponents with a fanatical ferocity, advancing boldly where other, more cautious, adversaries would have retreated.</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>In terms of magical abilities, none of the faithful of Loviatar were able to turn undead —though her clerics were, instead, bestowed the capacity to command such creatures . The Maiden of Pain further supplemented their stores of spells with a few unique ones, such as:</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Dambrath was the largest center of worship for the Loviatans, so much so that it came to be known as the Nation of Pain. However, beyond its borders, elsewhere in Faerûn, the Church of Loviatar most often based itself out of those cities that had grown decadent and overly large. These places, like Westgate and Waterdeep , Selgaunt and Saerloon —and even Telflamm , Mulmaster , Calimport , and Athkatla —were places where the clergy thrived, with tendrils reaching even into the dark, exotic reaches of Thay .</p>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>In such locales, many Loviatan temples were constructed of thick wood or stone , lending them the appearance of a penitentiary or an ascetic monastery, rather than a house of worship; they often went as far as adding barred windows to their clergy's rooms. Below most of these grim temples, vast dungeons could be found.</p>
<p>Notable temples of the Faith of Pain included:</p>
<p>Shrines to the Patroness of Torturers were also established, as of the mid–14th century DR , in the cities of Daerlun in Sembia Ordulin , and Tantras in the Vast.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<h3>Garments</h3>
<p>The clerical raiments of the Church of Pain were traditionally worn by adherents of any gender , and consisted of shoulder-length gloves, a choker gorget, and high boots—all of which were black. These were complimented by a robe , customarily slit along the sides. The garment itself could be an identical black or a stark white, but was always lined with a soft, red silk , producing glimpses of scarlet whenever the priest or priestess moved. Either atop or below their robes, the Loviatans also wore an audacious leather harness across their whole body.</p>
<p>If sent on an adventure, the clergy were not left entirely unprotected, but their light-weight armor was far from the best. It was pleated and made to resemble scale mail , but it offered less protection as it was intended to accentuate the wearer's body, prioritizing style over strength and coverage. Nonetheless, the faithful were proud of it, honored to wear such ceremonial attire.</p>
<p>Often, the Loviatans supplemented it with a breastplate covered in prongs and spikes, making their pleated armor slightly better—although even this did not make it as sturdy as the standard scale mail. This kind of breastplate was so jagged that a close hug from anyone wearing it could cause damage—an act referred to as the Embrace of Loviatar.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>The Faith of Pain often equipped itself with whips and serrated daggers , but their weaponry, and the magic items they had access to, increased in quality as they rose in the ranks. A lesser priest, for example, was not typically given access to anything enchanted , carrying only two daggers—one in a boot, another at their belt—and a barbed, 6-foot long whip. This changed if they ever became a full priest, reaching medium rank.</p>
<p>Then, the clergy member gained access to a poison -coated mace of black metal and a barbed, 4‑foot-long (1.2‑meter) cat-o'-nine-tails , with the former's handle being hollowed out and used as a container for sleeping poison . This poison was so powerful that it took effect even through the skin. Enough was reserved to last six strikes after the mace's first blow released the poison, and though it took anywhere from two minutes to five before activating, those who didn't resist it fell deeply asleep. Standard methods, such as cold water or a hard slap, were incapable of rousing the Loviatans' victims, who were put to sleep for forty minutes at least to nearly two hours at most.</p>
<p>The only ones typically allowed to make use of magic items were the highest members of the Church. While they were most often seen wearing multiple iron bands of Bilarro along their belt, a small number of them also utilized a unique form of the 4-foot-long cat-o'-nine-tails known as a wand of frost, fire, and fear . Constructed with a steel handle and electrum tails, such wands had a certain number of replenishable charges that were slowly drained with each blow. Functioning much like its constituent items, a wand of frost, fire, and fear appropriately racked its victims with heat, cold, or terror—though, if two lashes struck, the wand also unleashed a heinous combination. Of all its effects, only the fear-inducing one could be resisted.</p>
<p>Most exceptionally, a Loviatan was also blessed with a white wand , a godsend direct from the Patroness of Torturers herself. Given to those who had inflicted vast amounts of pain and torment, such a wand was most often bestowed upon dedicated, outstanding members of the Church of Pain. However—given Loviatar's abiding sadism—they were occasionally also given to good types, those who spread suffering without meaning to. In themselves, the white wands were mysterious instruments, acting of their own accord to absorb magic flung towards their wielders and, after consuming a certain number of spells, dissolving like melting ice.</p>
<h3>Holy Relics</h3>
<p>As a whole, the Loviatan clergy claimed a number of unique items under its purview. These included:</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Pain, in Loviatan doctrine, paved the path to many blessings. Only through its experience could genuine pleasure be attained, and only after accepting the sting—and persevering—was true strength found. The Maiden of Pain enlightened them to the fact that torment pervaded all of Toril . Therefore, the most sensible thing to do was to accept such suffering—and, when affronted, requite it as powerfully and painfully as possible.</p>
<p>Adherents were taught that discipline was at the heart of all punishment, not indiscriminate cruelty. They were to hurt not only those who desired the pain, but also those who would be worst tormented by it, or who deserved it. They also understood that pain could go beyond the physical, and were encouraged to appear enticing—even a measure of kindness, when administered unpredictably, could be a useful tool to the Loviatans. Though not a virtue in itself, its rare and sudden application instilled false hope, deepening the emotional torment suffered by their victims. The faithful believed that this heightened what they termed the Mystery of Loviatar's Mercy.</p>
<p>Loviatar's teachings declared pain from fire, from cold, and from whips as the most reliable forms of agony, but that any punishments, anywhere, were a chance to preach. To suffer pain was to be tested and strengthened. It was even said that Loviatar herself accompanied any whip, and that she, much like pain itself, was to be both yearned for and feared.</p>
<h3>Religious Art</h3>
<p>In the sacred imagery of her faithful, both the Maiden of Pain and her equipment were often depicted in deathly, monochromatic hues. They portrayed her as a slight and ghostly pale figure, bearing a wand the color of bone—or alternatively, a scourge or whip—and adorned in pleated, white armor.</p>
<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>All mystics and monks within the Faith of Pain were part of their respective orders: the mysterious Way of Transcendence for the former and the Disciples of the White Rod for the latter. The Disciples originated in an abbey near the western city of Calimport, capital of Calimshan . Besides these, however, the church had no orders of the typical, knightly sort within its ranks.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>The Church of Loviatar admitted many different sorts of people into its ranks, such as monks, mystics, and specialty priests, but its clerics were the most diverse. Often, they had additional training as wizards , most typically being illusionists or enchanters , as sorcerers , or even as proper fighters if they chose to master the use of their whips.</p>
<h3>Initiates</h3>
<p>These same clerics could also, with the right experience and desire, become initiates of Loviatar . This granted them access to some of the Church's most esoteric secrets, including the knowledge on how to cast fleshshiver , mystic lash , and Nybor's gentle reminder . Most notably, clerics who had been initiated were able to remain unshaken when others fell to fear and strike more boldly, but they were only capable of this after first suffering an amount of pain.</p>
<p>Initiation also served as one of the essential requirements for becoming a scourge maiden. This sect, which excluded all but women, was primarily—if not only—available to clerics or fighter-priestesses of the faith, as their skills and training were highly specialized. Though becoming a maiden of pain was similarly reserved only for female clergy, its requirements were not as stringent. A small number among them had prior training as assassins or rogues , but what mattered most was their excessive depravity, which set them apart from most other Loviatans.</p>
<h3>Crusaders</h3>
<p>The Church of Pain was also known to foster crusaders in the name of the Willing Whip. Little was demanded of these fanatics, beyond that they be skilled in the use of the scourge and lawful evil , but their specific training meant they lost the ability to access healing spells —nor were they able to turn undead , like the other Loviatans. What truly made a crusader of the Church unique, however, was their ability to generate a pain-inducing aura once a day. Those who fell victim to it were racked by such agonies that even the simplest actions, as well as attacks, became disorientated and fraught with pain.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Loviatans were amenable enough to align themselves with the clergy of other dark and evil powers, but it was not a common dynamic. As a whole, the Faith of Pain only made allegiances if they were first convenient, preferring its independence. In fact, their strongest bonds were ones of utter disdain.</p>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
<p>It was well known that the faithful reviled both the followers of Eldath and of Ilmater , for their peacewomen and painbearers were uniquely resistant to the Willing Whip's torment, but they especially hated the latter. Due to the Ilmatari's deepened devotion and cheerfulness, even in the face of pain, the Loviatans targeted Ilmat priests with added hostility, hunting and murdering them whenever possible.</p>
<p>In turn, many saw the priesthood of Loviatar as an enemy, but they rarely opposed the priesthood directly. The vengeance they brought upon anyone who offended their goddess or tarnished her name was infamous—as was the fact that death, in the eyes of the faithful, was only the most lenient form of retribution.</p>
<p>Despite this notoriety, some churches had members of their clergy dedicated entirely to combating the Church of Pain. The Companions of the Noble Heart , an order of Ilmatari paladins intent on eradicating the Loviatans, were one example, as were the assassins known as Scarlet Mummers , sent by the church of Lliira to avenge the murder of their goddess' lover .</p>
<p>Lesser foes of the faithful of Loviatar also included the followers of Gargauth , as well as those of Selûne and of Sharess . To the Faith of Pain, the former were saboteurs, trying to indoctrinate their worshipers—and those of other, dark powers—into the nascent following of the Hidden Lord, while the latter pair were the mysterious overseers of the Eyes of the Evening , a fellowship of werecats . Whenever the full moon rose, the felines pursued Loviatans and Sharrans alike—but, even so, the group's true motivations were unclear.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Rise of Lady Heartless</h3>
<p>One of the holiest relics of the Church of Loviatar came into public knowledge in the late 8th century, circa the Year of Awaiting Webs, 778 DR . Wielded by a woman known as Lady Heartless , she was a cruel and murderous mercenary of the Vilhon Reach who grew in infamy at the head of the Black Falcons of Fury , a company of adventuresses that steadily disturbed the local rulership.</p>
<p>Their worries only peaked when the Lady Heartless overthrew a petty realm in southern Sespech , installed herself in its castle, and bid renegades as far away as the Lake of Steam and Old Empires to join her. Soon, the fledgeling domain of Endrara found itself surrounded, beset by foreign armies. Calling to the Maiden of Pain, Lady Heartless offered a bold arrangement: the salvation of her realm—through delivered priestesses, torture-gargoyles , and spells—in exchange for the slow, tortured death of the previous ruler and the Church of Pain becoming Endrara's official religion.</p>
<p>Loviatar proved, ultimately, amenable. Her faithful arrived from across the whole of Faerûn to decimate the vastly superior armies, aided by divine, piercing magic that soared through the skies. Many thousands fell to the Loviatans in the conflict, which was later named the Great Slaughter . Lady Heartless, however, did not fight, and spent her time torturing her predecessor—a man known as the Jahorgan of Jahorga—by infesting him with parasites, dismembering him, and more.</p>
<p>These long sessions, during which she acquainted him to a unique whip, proved the first time that history would see and hear of the Lash of Loviatar . Even this holy weapon, however, could not protect the nation of Endrara from its next foe. Angered by Loviatar's direct intervention in the form of spells that appeared out of the sky, which he saw as an intrusion upon his portfolio , the god of natural destruction assaulted the domain with storms and floods until it and its people were utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>The Willing Whip, however, intervened once more; she plucked Lady Heartless from amidst Talos' wrath, rescuing her, and set the woman on a path to proselytize the Faith of Pain. Endreira Chathlass, as she was truly named, became the High Temptress of Loviatar far and wide. The goddess kept direct control over her, causing Endreira's behavior to slowly devolve into insanity , but she nevertheless preached, tireless and well-travelled, to the people of Faerûn—most especially, to young women.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the Loviatans first gained power in the nation of Dambrath. In the Year of the Deceptive Tongue, 831 DR , by betraying the ruling humans in favor of the invading drow , the Church was able to name the half-elven priestess Cathyr Shintar as queen. Despite her gradual successes, the High Temptress met her end less than two decades after, in the the Year of the Vigilant Familiar, 848 DR .</p>
<p>During the seventy years she spent dedicated to the Maiden of Pain, she kept the Lash of Loviatar close at hand. Its unique magic repeatedly proved instrumental when seeking converts, especially as her life became a string of near perpetual degeneracy and bloodshed. Even so, close to 6,000 new Loviatans were personally inducted by Lady Heartless before she was overwhelmed by her old age.</p>
<h3>The Death of Imshrara Vlengaun</h3>
<p>Unfortunately for the Church, their next leader would not prove to be nearly as long-lived. Ruling for only two years, Imshrara Vlengaun , the Chalice of the Faith, saw her possession of the Lash as proof of her authority; she believed it to be a direct gift from the Patroness of Torturers herself. Though she had lofty ambitions, marking the Lash as the faithful's holiest artifact, the Chalice Supreme was murdered—strangled to death—in her own quarters after only two years .</p>
<p>Though no one knew who had smuggled the creature inside, the mysterious culprit was a roper . Ishmara's Holy Guard, watchful as they were, only killed it after her own death, before presenting both her corpse and that of the roper to a group of high-ranking, hurriedly gathered priestesses. The pair went unburied, sealed in rooms where they slowly decayed—and, with them, went the Lash .</p>
<h3>The Search for the Lash</h3>
<p>For the Faith of Pain, the next dozen years were chaotic. Until one Kathlathtra Roultym finally took control in the Year of the Snow Rose, 862 DR , Imshara's subordinates vied for power amongst themselves constantly. The Sespechan woman, known also as Talons, put an end to the bloodshed and named herself High Holy Temptress of the Faith. She bid the remains of her predecessor be recovered, buried in a black catafalque made of stone, and respectfully buried in Undelos ' High House of Pain , to the south of Endrara's remnants.</p>
<p>The High Holy Temptress' trials, however, were far from over. During those twelve, turbulent years, another priestess had seemingly stolen the Lash of Loviatar from its place beside Imshara. A further eight were then spent searching for it, to no avail, as, by the will of the Maiden of Pain, neither her underlings nor any of their magic could locate the Lash .</p>
<p>Kathlathtra's search was ended in the Year of the Hooded Tracker, 870 DR —not due to the appearance of the holy weapon, however. It was due to her death at the hands of Imra , one of the woman's inferiors, who exploited Talons' weakness in her pursuit to torture the woman until she died, taking her Sacred Throne of Skulls and her title.</p>
<h3>Modern Years</h3>
<p>Much later, in 1150 DR , the Church of Pain saw an influx of worshipers on the Sword Coast , due to escalating raids by bands of both orcs and trolls , as well as a terrible plague. The Church of Loviatar gained an even vaster amount of popularity across Faerûn nearly a century later, during the aptly-named Year of Pain, 1245 DR . The construction of most of the faithful's northern temples also took place during that same year, and were still in use by the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<p>One of the clergy, the Sembite fighter-priest, Quinan Varnaed —alongside a yuan-ti ally of his—later established the Iron Ring slavers of Skullport in 1363 DR . He was also the one who constructed the Tower of Seven Woes, which became feared even in that cutthroat den of villainy.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>Worshipers of Loviatar were drawn from those who reveled in the suffering of others—the wicked , the torturers, and the sadists. Her following was not limited to humans alone, however; even certain creatures, particularly those who took monstrous pleasure in tormenting their own kind, revered the Willing Whip. These included:</p>
