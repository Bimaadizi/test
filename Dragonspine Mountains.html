<p>The Dragonspine Mountains , also referred to simply as the Dragonspines , was a range of peaks in the western Moonsea of North Faerûn , that divided the region into two separate halves.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While not the largest peaks of the Realms, the Dragonspines were a series of rough crags that were extremely difficult to traverse. They were wracked with frigid temperatures that turned away all but the most experienced travelers.</p>
<p>Those that dared to brave the peaks could find themselves with great rewards however, as they were rich with natural resources, including a wealth ore, such as black granite .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains were bordered on the northern side by the vast steppes known as the Ride , and to the west by the Border Forest . Nestled along its southern slopes were the Ticklebelly Hills , and beyond them the Grass Sea .</p>
<p>Two trails snaked through the mountains south from the Citadel of the Raven , the Teshpost Trail down to Teshwave , and the Zhentilar Trail all the way south to Zhentil Keep .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>Notable peaks in the range included mounts Launt , Ombaddor , Horgrymborr , Throndor , Tesh , and the caves of Skondarr beneath it, as well as Eastwall , the mountain that loomed over the entire Moonsea.</p>
<p>Situated among the higher altitudes of the Dragonspines was the Glacier of the Silver Blades . Runoff water in the mountain formed two major rivers in the mountains; the western Stoneshoulder Creek flowed north into Lake Maltorus , and the Stojanow river in the east ran southeast towards Phlan before emptying into the Moonsea lake.</p>
<p>The Lords of Zhentil Keep had mines in the western half of the range, while Melvaunt and Hillsfar had mines in the eastern half. Deep with the mounts was a network of caverns and subterranean passageways, remnants of the ancient dwarven realm of Sarphil . Located somewhere within the mountains was one of the Dragon's Claw portals , a portal network maintained by the dragon wizard Valraxaxath .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The eastern slopes of the Dragonspines held a passage to the Underdark , that facilitated slave trade between the Zhentarim and the drow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Treaty of the Ride was signed at a peace accord held within the foothills of the Dragonspines in the Year of the Plough, 906 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , the group of Zhentarim -hating freedom fighters known as the Knights of the North formed in the foothills of the mountains. For over a decade they led raids against Zhent forces until they grew to greater prominence.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the 14 th century, red , white , and at least one pair of copper dragons were known to lair in the higher peaks, along with other aerial creatures such as dire hawks , and hippogriffs .</p>
<p>Goblins , orcs , and giants filled the lower areas and valleys, that latter of which were occasionally enslaved by the dragons of the peaks.</p>
