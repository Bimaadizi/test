<p>Chimal was a general and later one of the Revered Counselors of the great Nexalan empire whose rule was characterized by establishing trade routes that brought prosperity over a hundred years before the arrival of the Golden Legion in 1361 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Under the rule of Chimal's father, the Revered Counselor Tenoch II , he served as the empire's general. Tenoch II oversaw a major road project that connected the nation of Nexal with its subjugated territory of Pezelac . The road construction was abandoned after Pezelac's rebellion. Chimal was put in charge of a mighty Nexala army and sent to quell the Pezels' unrest. Overzealous in his task, Chimal almost completely leveled a Pezelac city as an example of punishment for rebellion. But the cruel show of force subdued the unrest, and Pezelac resumed their tribute payments to Nexal. Chimal brought back a large number of slaves and goods that paid the war expenses off tenfold.</p>
<p>The Year of Ocean's Wrath, 1212 DR was marked by the death of the Revered Counselor Tenoch II and Chimal's ascension to Nexal's throne. The following eighteen years were calm and prosperous for the empire, apart from regular expeditions against the Kultakans . The most notable achievement of Chimal's was the expansion of trade. Nexal expanded its trade routes to all the cities of Pezelac, and some merchants traveled as far as the jungle lands of Payit . Trade agreements, albeit limited, were struck with the xenophobic Huacli city of Otomi .</p>
<p>Chimal's son, Totep , inherited the title of the Revered Counselor from his father in the Year of the Long Watch, 1230 DR ; however, his reign was short-lived, cut short by assassination six years later.</p>
