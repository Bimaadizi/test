<p>Nasnas were humanoid creatures created by evil priests or wizards in Zakhara . They were fanatically loyal to their creator and would defend them to the death.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were literally half-humanoid, possessing only a single arm and leg and half a face and torso.</p>
<p>Their skin had a gray tint and their eyes sparkled with insanity.</p>
<p>Nasnas hopped about on their single leg when they moved. Some nasnas had a small wing, though it did not make them capable of flight.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Their wilds hoots and screams could cause panic in their foes or paralyze them with fear.</p>
<p>They could only be harmed with weapons that were enchanted or made of iron .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Nasnas used weapons and wore armor. Their single arm was incredibly strong, adding ferocity to their attacks.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Nasnas lived short lives, often killing themselves before the age of thirty.</p>
<p>Their only purpose in life was to protect their creator.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>These creatures served as guardians in the strongholds of evil priests or wizards.</p>
<p>To create a nasnas a special potion was brewed that included a drop of the creatorâ€™s blood. The potion was injected into a piece of fruit which was sliced in half. If a woman ate the fruit she would conceive a nasnas and give birth nine months later. The creator would then arrive to claim the nasnas.</p>
