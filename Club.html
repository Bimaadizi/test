<p>Clubs were a simple, one-handed type of melee weapon and one of the oldest known weapons in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Clubs were typically stout, hardwood sticks that narrowed at one end for gripping and widened at the other. However, the appearance of clubs and the materials used to construct them widely varied. Blunt wooden sticks could be considered clubs just as much as table legs, large branches, or tree trunks (in the case of some giants and other large creatures).</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<h3>Enchantment</h3>
<p>Clubs could carry any enchantment typical to other weapons, with the only limitation being the enchanter 's power and the material of the club itself. Spells, such as Shillelagh , could either mimic a club's effects or create powerful magical weapons.</p>
