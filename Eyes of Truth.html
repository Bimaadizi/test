<p>The Eyes of Truth , also called the Helmet of Infravision , was a magical helm that granted enhanced sight. It was worn by several individuals in Faerûn , particularly around the border between the Sword Coast and Amn , during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The helm allowed the wielder to see with infravision for up to 120 feet (36.6 meters). It also protected them receiving serious injuries in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The helm was crafted by the scavenger dungeoneer Babette Maelestrom . While most considered her an eagle-eyed treasure hunter, she attributed her vast accumulation of wealth to her helm.</p>
<p>Some time before 1368 DR the Eyes of Truth came into the possession of a bounty hunter named Neira , who was hired by Sarevok Anchev to kill his fellow divine siblings of Bhaal . One of them, Gorion's Ward , may have taken it from her in the Nashkel mines. However, another may have been found by them in Jon Irenicus 's dungeon the following year .</p>
