<p>Davrick Fain was the lead cultist of Auril in Icewind Dale in 1484 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Davrick was a common merchant of Bremen until the winter of 1483 DR when the power of Auril truly manifested to him. Soon he started gathering in his city a small cult of Auril, also founding a small temple in a old verbeeg cave in Kelvin's Cairn . Davrick befriended Rycher at that time and thanks to him Davrick found an egg of a remorhaz , which he saw as Auril's sacred creature. He hoped to hatch it and send the monster against unbelievers.</p>
