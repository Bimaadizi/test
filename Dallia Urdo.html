<p>Dallia Urdo was a young and ambitious member of the merchant Urdo family of Westgate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dallia was a brash and unpredictable woman who often responded aggressively and defied common sense or good will.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Dallia Urdo resided in her family's estate facing the Market Triangle and personally recruited several talented gladiators to be her bodyguards from Westgate's own Quivering Thumb arena. The thuggish woman, part of a mercantile family, set her eyes on an upstart shop, Okuzo's Imports , when it began dealing in perfumes and spices from the eastern lands of Kara-Tur . Dallia Urdo sought to squash the competition to the Urdo family business before Okuzo could grow and become a threat. Dallia attempted to buy Okuzo's business out, but the Wanese merchant refused. Soon after, just a few days later, Dallia came to the store with her henchmen to intimidate Okuzo into selling. When Okuzo refused once again, she was backhanded with a ring -adorned hand of the thuggish Urdo scion, leaving the painful welt. The goons left but not before promising to return later to continue "negotiations."</p>
