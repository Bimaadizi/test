<p>Ubar khel Muhif was the Caliph of the Free City of Umara in north Zakhara in 1367Â DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ubar was the Khan of the Astok hill tribe of barbarians who inhabited the Furrowed Mountains near Umara. After becoming enlightened , Ubar offered his services to Umara's former Caliph. He staged a rebellion within the palace during a battle between Umara and Muluk , seizing the throne for himself and marrying Princess Maran ber Ubar to solidify his claim. Order was reestablished in Umara before troops from Qudra arrived, so Ubar was accepted as the new Caliph of Umara in order to prevent a prolonged siege of the city.</p>
