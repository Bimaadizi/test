<h2>History</h2>
<p>Peredus the Great was an adventuring hero and a caravan guard who became renowned for his selfless deeds and his enchanted sword. The legend claimed that he was traveling with a trade caravan as they were ambushed by villainous bandits just outside Daggerford in the place known as the Western Farmlands . Peredus fell defending the merchants, and his body was thrown into an old dried well.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Peredus returned to haunt the well after his final resting place was taken over by a young black dragon Sulfurus . The wyrm used the dead caravan guard's bones as a chewing toy, returning and chaining Peredus to the Prime Material plane as a restless spectre . Along with the dragon, undead Peredus was one more grave danger to anyone attempting to delve into the well searching for the hero's enchanted sword .</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , a roguish adventurer Burnas Tellrot learned of the location of the well and hoped to plunder the legendary hero's final resting place to finance his retirement. The halfling sent several would-be adventurers to their death as all of them were unsuccessful. Eventually, Burnas enroll the aid of the Hero of Daggerford . Once the adventurer descended into the well, they became trapped, with the only way out being the way through. Peredus the Great manifested himself, offering the hero a way out in exchange for release from the undead existence. The hero confronted the evil black dragon and recovered the bones of the fabled hero. The body was submerged into a magical pool nearby, sanctifying it and releasing the restless spirit of Peredus. Before his departure into the afterlife, Peredus told the Hero of an underwater way out - through a submerged cavern that led into the Wild Hills area outside of Daggerford.</p>
