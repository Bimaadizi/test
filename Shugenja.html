<p>Shugenja ( pronounced : / ʃ uː g ɛ n dʒ ɑː / shoo-gen-jah ) (also spelled shukenja ) were wielders of divine magic who controlled elemental forces. In Shou Lung , shugenja were called dang-ki ( pronounced : / d ɑː ŋ k i / dahng-kee ).</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Unlike sohei , shugenja were not bound to their monastery or temple, instead wandering the land. A new shugenja received training in a monastery. This training focused on meditation, ritual and self-defense. In Kara-Tur, shugenja performed a variety of services, including marriages, defeating evil spirits, funeral rites and purification rituals.</p>
<p>Shugenja lived by strict principles laid down by their religions. They took vows of poverty and had no connections to their family or clan or the caste systems found across Kara-Tur. They avoided violence and lived a life of discipline.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shugenja were skilled spell-casters. They had limited training in martial arts or use of weapons, using their divine magic abilities to defend themselves or others. A shugenja can use their ki to protect themselves from physical and mental attacks.</p>
