<p>House Chûmavh was the ruling drow house of the city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>Until 1372 DR, House Chûmavh resided within the impressive Castle Maerimydra , which overlooked the city of the same name. After the city's destruction, however, Tower Chûmavhraele became the new base for the House under the city of Ravens Bluff .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Rulers of Maerimydra</h3>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the Silence of Lolth rendered all the Lolth -worshipers in Maerimydra without their ability to cast divine spells. In the wake of this, many sought to overthrow the city, including the city's archmage . Although Archmage Duneth Wharreil and his demonic allies did not topple the defensive structure of Castle Maerimydra, another enemy did manage to defeat them. The aspiring cult of Kiaransalee , led by Irae T'sarran , sneaked into the Castle and slew all House Chûmavh's Lolth-worshipers. There ended the reign of House Chûmavh in Maerimydra.</p>
<h3>Beneath Raven's Bluff</h3>
<p>After the fall of Maermydra, the survivors relocated to Tower Chûmavhraele under the leadership of Marquise Dresimil Chûmavh . In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , House Chûmavh attempted to activate an ancient drow mythal , inadvertently releasing Jack Ravenwild in the process.</p>
