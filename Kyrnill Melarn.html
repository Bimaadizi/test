<p>Kyrnill Melarn (formerly known as Kyrnill Kenafin ) was formerly the matron mother of House Kenafin in Menzoberranzan and later the First Priestess of House Melarn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Starting before 1361 DR and lasting until 1383 DR , Kyrnill Kenafin served as the matron mother of House Kenafin. When House Kenafin and House Horlbar merged to form House Melarn, Kyrnill allowed Zhindia Horlbar to assume leadership of the house, expecting that Zhindia would die in a power struggle. Zhindia survived, however, and as First Priestess, Kyrnill found great pleasure in seeing Zhindia's power undermined.</p>
