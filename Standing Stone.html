<p>The Standing Stone was a large, imposing stone obelisk that served as a symbol of unity between the elves of Cormanthyr and the humans of the Dalelands . More specifically, the monument celebrated their alliance that grew out of the agreement known as the Dales Compact . It also marked the beginning of the use of Dale reckoning calendar, which gained widespread use throughout Faerûn . It was located just south of Myth Drannor within the forest of Cormanthor , at the junction between Rauthauvyr's Road and the Moonsea Ride , about halfway between Blackfeather Bridge and Hillsfar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dark, glossy-gray monolith stood 20' (6 m) tall and was covered in Elven runes that specified the terms of the treaty known as the Dales Compact. It was magically enchanted in such a way that any attempts to deface, or vandalize its surface rapidly repaired.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Located deep within the forest of Cormanthor, the Standing Stone was originally, after its construction, not accessible by humans. However, when Raythauvyr of Sembia demanded a road be built through the region, under threat of war, it was routed to pass within viewing distance of the monument. This gesture was meant to exemplify the lack of need for violence required from the allies of elves to achieve what they so desired.</p>
<p>In the 900s DR , the region around the Standing Stone succumbed to more frequent and vicious attacks by the bandit-lord Galath , led from a nearby overlook . He and his forces were thwarted by a group of mages assembled from merchants of the nearby, rapidly growing nation of Sembia.</p>
<p>In the 1360s DR , a glowing, floating scroll appeared at the Standing Stone. It read: "List of humble folk in Archendale" but was otherwise blank. This passive-aggressive note was put up in response to a 25- gp "bounty" set up by the captains of the Archenriders for information or other means to embarrass or humiliate Elminster of Shadowdale .</p>
<p>On Flamerule 21 1374 DR , the fey'ri of House Dlardrageth destroyed the Standing Stone after a decisive battle against the army of Hillsfar .</p>
<p>It was rebuilt just over 50 years later by the people of Ashabenford , the then-permanent home of the Dales Council , after reaffirming the Dales Compact with the restored city of Myth Drannor .</p>
