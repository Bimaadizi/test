<p>Druidhome was druidic settlement on the island of Ilighôn , off the coast of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Druidhome was situated about a mile away from the south-eastern shores of Springbrook Shallows , a large lake at the end of the Springbrook river that rushed down from the Elder Spires at the center of Ilighôn. Lake Bluesprings laid around 5 miles (8 kilometers) to Druidhome's east. The settlement itself was more of a small collection of groves than a traditional village. This strange settlement served as a home for old clerics , druids , and rangers who served Silvanus , Mielikki , and Eldath . All the inhabitants of Druidhome arrived there in their advanced twilight years to spend them in peace, serving the deities they devoted their lives to.</p>
<p>Most inhabitants of Druidhome preferred calm and seclusion to worldly affairs, but they readily took up weapons in defense of their forests and churches if the need arose.</p>
