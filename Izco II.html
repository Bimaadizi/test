<p>Izco II was the son of Izco the Elder and one of the Revered Counselors of the great Nexalan empire whose rule started less than 100 years before the arrival of the Golden Legion in 1361 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Izco's passing of power to his son, Izco II, was celebrated with a humble sacrifice of a thousand men and women, a humble number that angered the deity of Nexala. Zaltec the Bloody awoken Mount Zatal causing a disaster, and later, a large-scale Feathered War was organized to atone in the eyes of their god. After the cities of the Valley of Nexal carved ten thousand hearts, the bloodthirsty was was sated, and Izco II took the throne from his still-living predecessor.</p>
<p>The rule of Izco II was similar to his fathers, characterized by cultural and artistic growth of Nexal and continuous flow of tribute of goods and slaves from the subjugated territories.</p>
<p>With the death of Izco II, some less than 100 years before the arrival of Amnian colonists, Nexal picked its next ruler from among the military â€“ venerable general Pakli whose rule ended in the Year of the Trumpet, 1301 DR .</p>
