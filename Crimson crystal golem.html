<p>Crimson crystal golems were a unique variety of golems created to celebrate the Protector's Jubilee , an anniversary celebration of the city's rebirth, hosted in the late 15 th century DR in Neverwinter , the Jewel of the North.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Crimson crystal golems were, as it was evident from the name, carved of red crystal and resembled ceremonial armor sets created for the same celebration for the city's many adventurers .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These constructs were crafted purely for ceremonial use, to attend Neverwintran galas and banquets. However, they also had some limited use in battle. Their body could be shattered in battle, dealing devastating damage to the owner's enemies, and, when a crimson crystal golem was near, its owner received a boon of increased accuracy and increased chance of dodging attacks.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Crimson crystal golems' creation took place at the very end of the late 15 th century DR. By the order of Lord Neverember , Protector's Jubilee Parade and Festival goers were given an opportunity to purchase crimson crystal items and constructs.</p>
