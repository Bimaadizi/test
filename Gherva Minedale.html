<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gherva Minedale offered her family member, Stug Minedale the opportunity to join the Vigilant Knights order of lawful and goodly warriors on one condition â€“ Stug was to stop beating people up for the Guild , a notorious criminal power in Baldur's Gate. This posed a dilemma that the two discussed over a drink or ten at the Elfsong Tavern in the Lower City of the Gate. Stug insisted that he had already taken the money from Uktar for beating someone up, and going back on the agreement was akin to oath-breaking. Gherva, however, remained stern, stating that if he were to do that job for the Guild, Stug could kiss the Vigilant Knights membership goodbye. Eventually, Stug agreed to return Uktar's coin but was afraid that his own knees would be broken as a result.</p>
