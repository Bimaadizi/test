<p>The Thistledown family was a human farming family who lived in the Silver Marches in the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The family did honest work, living off the land. The three generations of the family lived in a secluded farm in the western outskirts of Maldobar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR , the renegade drow Drizzt Do'Urden had begun exploring the surface world. The human Thistledown family were the first good people he encountered since he escaped from the Underdark . He saw them as a peaceful and loving society, unlike his own family in Menzoberranzan . However, the family were under threat from the local gnolls , who'd tried to befriend Drizzt. But he saw their evil intentions and slaughtered them.</p>
<p>The gnolls had been sent by the barghest Ulgulu and when Ulgulu discovered his ploy was foiled by a drow , he hatched a plan to frame Drizzt for a massacre. He had his subordinate quickling Tephanis steal one of the drow's scimitars , shapeshifted in a form approximate to a drow and slayed as least two Thistledown humans, then left the scimitar under a bed, which led to the successful, albeit temporary, framing of Drizzt to the authorities. Drizzt's pursuers would come to realize his innocence and declared the Thistledowns avenged by the drow.</p>
