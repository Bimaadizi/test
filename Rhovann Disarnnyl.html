<p>Rhovann Disarnnyl was a powerful moon elf mage formerly of Myth Drannor who was active in the Moonsea in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He fought and lost a duel with Geran Hulmaster over a moon elf maiden and lost a hand in the battle. Geran was banished from Myth Drannor for his crime.</p>
<p>Later, Rhovann was banished himself for practicing forbidden dark magic.</p>
<p>Rhovann was driven by his desire for revenge against Geran, and, in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Rhovann sought out his old nemesis and helped to stage a coup in Hulburg that deposed the Hulmasters . Rhovann used spells to dominate the mind of the leader of the merchant council, Maroth Marstel , turning him into Rhovann's puppet. He then solidified his hold over Hulmaster by creating runehelm golems using his shadow magic.</p>
<p>Rhovann was slain by Geran Hulmaster in the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , at Griffonwatch Keep in Hulburg.</p>
