<p>The Acid Aerie was gorge located several days walk west of Blingdenstone .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Acid Aerie was several hundred-foot-wide and filled with foul-smelling acid, the result of a wizard's experiment long ago [ as of when? ] . Several crisscrossing stone walkways of various widths allowed land-bound creatures to traverse the cavern and leave via the many tunnels that lined the walls, several of which lead into simple side-corridors or into the Wormwrithings .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The 'Aerie' part of its name was gained from a flock of dire corbies that inhabited the area, which were killed by Drizzt Do'Urden , Belwar Dissengulp , Clacker , and the spirit wraith of Zaknafein Do'Urden .</p>
