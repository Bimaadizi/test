<p>Silverscales Street was a cobbled lakeside street in Suzail . It stretched from The Basin , the city's commercial deepwater harbor, to the edge of Bolliver's Wharf .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The street was a more or less straight line that began at the buildings constructed on Suzail's Basin, immediately crossed the southern end of Nerester's Run , and continued southeast, past the end of the Court Close , crossing the Dancing Druid Lane , moving along Bolliver's Wharf's eastern shore and ending at the ninety degree turn into another lakeside street.</p>
<p>The northern part of Silverscales Street was always decorated with many frames for drying fishing nets. The amount of drying nets was a telltale sigh of how abundant the day's catch was.</p>
