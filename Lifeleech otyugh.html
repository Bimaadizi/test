<p>A lifeleech otyugh was a type of powerful, magically -infused gulguthra that fed on the energy of healing spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These uncommon gulguthras were far superior to standard otyughs, and had four sets of monstrous tentacles instead of two. Lifeleech otyughs were considerably stronger than normal otyughs, with their strength matching that of stone giants . They appeared bloated, and had a tough hides that strangely twisted over their bodies. Like ordinary otyughs, each life leech otyughs had a 2‑foot-long (0.61‑meter) central eye stalk and their bodies were of 8 ft (2.4 m) diameter. Lifeleech otyughs weighed around 200 lb (91 kg) more than their more-ordinary cousins, but despite this, moved twice as fast.</p>
<p>These gulguthras were very good climbers, and naturally blended in with their murky environments.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Perverted by arcane experiments, lifeleech otyughs were often bent towards neutral evil alignment , unlike typical otyughs, which were usually neutral .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Lifeleech otyughs were challenging combatants, especially compared with ordinary otyughs. They could attack twice as often (due to having double the amount of tentacles), and deal more damage with each tentacle. Their bite was also more deadly. These twisted aberrations could last about thrice as long in combat as regular otyughs, and were much better naturally armored.</p>
<p>The most unique ability of these creatures was its lifeleech aura. Whenever healing spells were cast within 60 ft (18 m) of the creatures, they would sap the power of such spells, being healed in the process.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These dung-eaters lurked in disgusting refuse-filled pits, where they often covered themselves in their mess. They were, unsurprisingly, reported to inhabit the sewers of Waterdeep .</p>
