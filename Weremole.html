<p>A weremole was a type of lycanthrope that could take the form of a monstrous giant mole. This strain of lycanthropy was thought to only affect gnomes and it was caused by the bloodthirsty gnomish deity Urdlen , the Crawler Below, and weremoles were its savage servants.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Resembling their savage god, a weremole could shift into the form of a monstrous giant mole, some 3 feet (0.91 meters) in length. It was hairless with dead-white skin, and had an enormous pair of claws. This form was classed as a dire animal .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While in giant mole form, a weremole was completely blind, yet made up for it with extraordinary senses. When above ground, they were able to sense any creature in contact with the earth up to 50 feet (15 meters) away. Moreover, when below ground, they were able to sense any creature around them as well as they might see in full light, up to a distance of 90 feet (27 meters). Regardless, they remained oblivious to flying creatures, and were vulnerable to them.</p>
<p>They retained all the traditional abilities and powers of gnomes. In addition, weremoles could converse with any small burrowing creature to as big as an osquip . Furthermore, they had an innate ability to command them, similar to a suggestion spell , once a day. They could also call up a horde of burrowing creatures to obey them, similar to summon swarm , once a day.</p>
<p>As lycanthropes, they could only be harmed by silver or magical weapons.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In giant mole form, they attacked with their claws and bites.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The weremole infection was spread on the claws of Urdlen, the Evil One. Any gnome struck by its avatar risked becoming a weremole; there no purpose or preference to this, save that only gnomes could be infected.</p>
<p>Urdlen had weremoles among its burrowing servants. Most notorious and terrible of them were the Blood Screamers , a savage and bloodthirsty pack of weremole gnome bandits based in the Bandit Wastes of Lapaliiya in southwest Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR . They launched raids from the Nathaghal Mountains and all the way to the Nath in Halruaa and to the Rathgaunt Hills at the end of the Channath Vale in the Shaar . They terrorized and preyed upon all living creatures they caught in these lands, and had been an ever-present enemy of the gnomes who lived in the Nath and Rathgaunt Hills for decades up to the early 1370s DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Weremoles were first reported in the Realms after the avatar of Urdlen assaulted gnome communities in the countryside during the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR .</p>
