<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the publication of Volo's Guide to Monsters , Frestin was one of many hapless thrill-seekers who were intrigued and charmed by the author's description of the town of Phandalin . He made his way to the town and attempted to eat and drink at the quaint establishments detailed by Volo, and proceeded to get very drunk. In his stupor, he was robbed of both his purse and his mount, and somehow lost an ear. When he was discovered in the morning, he was face-down in a bed of sunflowers with little memory of the night before.</p>
