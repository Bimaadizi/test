<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Denver liked written contracts. All his employers had to sign a very wordy and complicated contract that guaranteed a term of service and specified the penalties to be incurred should the contract be broken; in truth, he used the contacts to scare his subordinates.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An outcast noble of Waterdeep , he tried a career in adventuring until he discovered his true vocation: restaurateur. Soon, Denver had opened a series of taverns all over the city, becoming very rich. In 1370 DR , he had to become the head cook of Traitor Picks , after the regular cook was fired and nobody wanted to stay in the position.</p>
