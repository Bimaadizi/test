<p>A telepath , also known as a telepathic psion , was a type of psion who specialized in the telepathy discipline of psionics , honing their skills in mental communication, mind reading, and manipulating other creatures. They were equivalent to the enchanters of arcane magic .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Like other forms of psion, telepaths could arise from almost any race, including blue goblins , changelings , eladrin , and gnomes . The path of the telepath was also particularly prevalent among mind flayers , ulitharids , and elder brains .</p>
<p>In the city of Skullport , telepaths were prevalent among the psions trained at the Hall of Mental Splendor to become cognition thieves .</p>
<p>Out of all psions, telepaths were particularly wary of undead , as their immunity to mental effects rendered most of a telepath's arsenal of abilities ineffective.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Telepaths almost exclusively utilized powers that fell within the purview of the telepathy discipline. Their specialization in this discipline allowed telepaths to unlock a suite of powers that were unknown to other psions, such as brain lock , psionic dominate , and mind seed . In the years following the Spellplague , almost all telepathic psions exhibited the powers distract and send thoughts .</p>
<p>Their discipline lent telepaths to influencing and manipulating the minds of others, though they could just as well deceive their senses or unleash devastating mental assaults to destroy an opponent's mind.</p>
<p>Telepaths were also skilled in the art of remote viewing , a psionic means of scrying .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>While traditionally psionics users such as telepathic psions didn't need any physical tools or weaponry to practice their discipline, following the Spellplague they began using implements to enhance their abilities. Typically these took the form of orbs and staves , through which they would channel their psionic energy into powers.</p>
