<p>Lureene was an innkeeper at the Rising Moon in Highmoon , Deepingdale , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was strong-willed and kind.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Her cooking was excellent, per Volo , who explicitly called out her butter tarts as amazing.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lureene remained part of the staff at the Rising Moon even after marrying Gorstag.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She was quite proud of Shandril Shessair , who had once been an inn maid like her. She also married Gorstag , the proprietor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1357Â DR , Lureene waited tables and flirted with people. She slept in Gorstag's loft with Shandril, save on nights when she had a man; she otherwise spent the nights telling Shandril what tales the travelers shared while waiting tables. Per Shandril, Lureene was constantly busy with the inn.</p>
<p>She was one of the waiters on the evening that the Company of the Bright Spear came to the Rising Moon, on Mirtul 6 . She consoled Gorstag after Shandril left with the company and, on the night that Shandril returned, he asked her to marry him; she agreed. As Shandril arrived, Lureene greeted her, and learned that too many mages were after the girl.</p>
<p>On the morning after, she kept watch over Shandril until she was fully rested. After Shandril left on Flamerule 9 , she bore witness to Korvan talking to a Cult of the Dragon mage, Thiszult ; after he attempted to slay her, she was protected by Gorstag, who slew him. Lureene looked for horses , only to find they were all dead.</p>
<p>Unknown to her, Shandril briefly scried on her while she was together with Gorstag, to no great consequence, shortly before their next contact: They received another contact from her later that month on Flamerule 27 , after Shandril destroyed the Wizards' Tower in the Citadel of the Raven , learning that Shandril was with child. Lureene advised her to stop at two kids.</p>
