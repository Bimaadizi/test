<p>Magen ( pronounced : /ˈ m eɪ dʒ ɛ n / MAY-jen ), were green-skinned constructs created by the create magen spell. There were at least three known varieties found on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While they appeared as humanoids with green skin, magen were not living beings but magical constructs. All of them had green skin and blood that appeared similar to liquid mercury .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While they all shared similar characteristics, the powers of each magen varied depending on their type. All magen had inherent protection against magical spells and similar effects, and their bodies combusted into innocuous flames upon their death.</p>
<p>While all magen were able to understand the language(s) spoken by their creator, they were not granted the ability of speech.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Magen were formed with a sense of perfect obedience. They protected their creators and catered to their needs without question or delay.</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>These magen were often outfitted with armor and weaponry, and relegated to the duties of guards and protectors.</p>
<p>Imbued with electric energy, galven magen could shock others with their touch and discharge bolts of lightning seemingly at will.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful of their kind, hypnos magen were granted telepathic and psychic powers, giving them the power to strike at the minds of others or command others with their thoughts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The arcanists of ancient Netheril used magen as servants in a variety of different roles, including laborers, bodyguards, and personal attendants.</p>
<p>A number of magen lived in the ruined Netherese enclave of Ythryn for over a millennium after the fall of Netheril , well into the 15 th century DR .</p>
