<p>Coggin's Rise was a trail that ran through the hills from Stagwick to Castle Hartwick . The hills in the region were covered with white-barked aspens . It took between a half hour and an hour to travel the full distance by horse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was off Coggin's Rise where Princess Brianna and her firbolg bodyguard Morten were ambushed by Ice Spire ogres led by Goboka in 1366 DR . The princess was kidnapped, because her father, King Camden had promised her to the tribe of ogres in exchange for their assistance in his war against his brother Dunstan years prior.</p>
