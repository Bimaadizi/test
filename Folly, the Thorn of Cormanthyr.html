<p>Folly, the Thorn of Cormanthyr was a powerful rapier found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Folly was an adamantine blade that could pierce through almost anything. It was filled with a burning fire that blasted those it struck, burning deeper and deeper each time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The blade was from old Myth Drannor before the Weeping War , and was lost with the city, embodying the follies that had led to its fall. It eventually emerged in a Cult of the Dragon base hidden in the ruins, taken over by a Red Wizards of Thay force that sought to enslave the dracolich Karliath . The blade may have then been found by the forces of the Cormanthor Elves when they attacked the Red Wizards.</p>
