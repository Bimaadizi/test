<p>Moondale was one of the largest and most prosperous of the Dalelands , located in the southeastern region deep within the expansive forest of Cormanthor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Moondale was one of the first dales founded after the raising of the Standing Stone in 1 DR . The dale enjoyed rapid growth and flourishing trade, particularly with the nearby nation of Sembia . This growing alliance culminated with the peaceful annexation of the people of the dale by Sembia sometime around 1070 DR . Eventually the merchant kingdom founded the city of Ordulin over the former dale, which quickly grew into a bustling metropolis and was declared Sembia's capital. Most of the dalesfolk saw this as a warning for events that might spread to their homes; the folk of Tasseldale viewed it as a plan of action.</p>
<h2>Geographical features</h2>
<p>Whereas the Ordulin of 14 th century was separated from the Elven Wood , Moondale existed in the age when the great forest stretched all the way east to the Sea of Fallen Stars . Deep in the forest, Moondale was nestled in a wide valley of grassland.</p>
