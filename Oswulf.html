<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early History</h3>
<p>Almost four centuries prior to the mid-14 th century DR , Oswulf and his brother, Eldamar built the Castle of the Twins. Not long later, the mining town of Verdigris was established just below their castle. Oswulf helped guide the town for a long time, and would hold meetings in Verdigris' great hall. After such a time, his brother became obsessed with becoming immortal. Oswulf, intrigued, discovered his brother's plan to become a lich , and he tried to persuade him not take this evil step.</p>
<h3>The Silver Blades</h3>
<p>On a winter's night, Oswulf became horrified when he realised his twin brother had turned into a lich. Oswulf swiftly left the Castle of the Twins and formed the Silver Blades , with the aim to contain his brother's evil.</p>
<p>Oswulf journeyed back to Verdigris, along with his Silver Blades. Here, they forced out the monsters that now inhabited the ruined town. Despite his brother's lichdom, Oswulf was still unwilling not to slay him. The casters of the Silver Blades researched a new spell to encase the valley in a glacier. Casting it, all within were frozen alive. In order to watch over the frozen valley and protect the Silver Blades, Oswulf sacrificed himself. From then on, he acted as a spirit guardian; only by his word could one enter or leave the castle gates.</p>
