<p>The Spotted Man was a retired treasure hunter living in the Mistshore neighborhood of Waterdeep in the late-15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This man's body was riddled in bloated blue spots that burst periodically, weeping a blue tinted blood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The man who would take on the alias "Spotted Man" was quite a successful treasure hunter until one of his adventures left him spellscarred . Just before he contracted the condition he had discovered the location of the wrecked ship Ardent Purveyor and was planning to launch an expedition to loot it. Following his spellscarring, the Spotted Man feared that taking to the open sea or diving underwater would worsen his condition.</p>
<p>In 1479 DR , a group of adventurers approached him that were in search of the Ardent Purveyor . After some convincing he informed the adventurers that the currents of Deepwater Harbor had placed the wreck not in Umberleeâ€™s Cache , but close to it, and provided a map with some reckoning points.</p>
