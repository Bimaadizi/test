<p>Titans , called voninjotunen in their own language, were the largest of the true giant races, standing even taller than cloud or storm giants . In the social order of giants, they were ranked highest on the Ordning , above all other giants, giant-kin , and ogres .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Titans resembled large, muscular humans who typically lacked facial hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Titans were typically some of the most intelligent of giants.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Many titans were capable spellcasters or psionicists . And they were the only race of giants not known to have runecasters .</p>
<p>They also had numerous spell-like abilities. Such as holy smite , meteor swarm , and chain lightning . Some were capable of becoming invisible at will, levitating , and becoming ethereal at least twice a day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Titans typically wielded a huge warhammer but also carried javelins to throw.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The titan race began with an individual by the name of Lanaxis , one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea .</p>
<p>Around −31,500 DR , a titan thane named Omo was engaged in combat with Zhoukoudien , leader of the Batrachi . Omo ended up slaying him and inciting war between their people. The titans would come to dominate the batrachi in this war and, according to Abeiran scholars, it would lead the latter to perform a powerful summoning ritual that culminated in the Tearfall .</p>
<p>When Annam founded the kingdom of Ostoria he ceded control of the plains to Lanaxis, who would found the dynasty of the titans, east of the Great Rift in the land of Eastern Shaar . The titans and storm giants would create some of Ostoria's greatest cities, featuring mechanical conveyances and galleries that would house artistic tributes to all giantkind.</p>
<p>The eventual disappearance of titans on Abeir-Toril was a matter of speculation. According to one myth popularized by the book , History of the Last March of the Giants , the titans grew so arrogant that they challenged the gods . They in turn cursed their monarch with fascination and his subjects with absolute devotion to him. They then sent a star crashing down to the planet and through their nation, causing widespread catastrophes and leaving a huge valley that became the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>Being cursed with curiosity, the then-king of the titans chased after the star and his dutiful subjects followed suit. They chased it all the way to the Great Sea and then dove in after it, never to be seen again. Another myth claimed that after Lanaxis had poisoned his mother Othea and was cursed by her, his progeny fled to the plane of Arborea .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>Following the fall of Ostoria, titans were primarily found on planes other than the Prime Material , such as Arborea and Warrior's Rest .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>As inhabitants of the Outer Planes , titans were often known to be capable of speaking the Abyssal and Celestial languages. Many were also known to speak Draconic , Common , and all six dialects of Giant .</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Out of all the giant races, titans were the most amicable towards storm giants due to their disposition.</p>
