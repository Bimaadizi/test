<p>Avnon Des was First Demarch of Mask in the Hall of Shadows in Elgrin Fau , a city from another world that was moved to the Plane of Shadow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When an exiled priest, Kesson Rel , moved the Hall of Shadows to the Plane of Shadow in order to capture the shadow dragon Furlinastis , Avnon Des chose to sacrifice himself and the remaining priests of the Hall of Shadows in order to release Furlinastis from the soul spell that Kesson Rel had put on the dragon. But Avnon and the other priests lived on as spirits.</p>
<p>When Erevis Cale 's party destroyed Kesson Rel, in gratitude Avnon and his fellows agreed to protect the Abbey of the Rose .</p>
<p>Finally, in the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , the Oracle released the spirits from their service and they went to serve Drasek Riven .</p>
