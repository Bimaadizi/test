<p>Final Word was a set of decorative enchanted throwing knives originating from the kingdom of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each throwing knife was engraved with the word "Enough!". They were masterfully crafted and were created in a distinctly Cormyrean style.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The daggers carried a +1 enchantment and had a chance of silencing a target upon a successful hit. Final Word was not a fierce weapon, but its magic allowed the knives to fly true and far with undiscovered maximum range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The design of these magic blades was evidence of their ornamental or ceremonial purpose in functioning of some fierce Cormyrean school of debate. Scholars believed that Final Word was used to signal the end of a debate or possibly to end a discourse by less civilized means. In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Final Word could be found in the besieged small logging village of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale .</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Final Word daggers ended up in the hands of Silvenius Crim , a dealer of magical items and an agent of the Arcane Brotherhood in the town of Targos.</p>
