<p>Laszik Silvermind was a renowned psion mystic and devotee of the god Auppenser who reformed the empire of Jhaamdath during the 6 th millennium before Dalereckoning .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −5730 DR , the Lord of Reason used Laszik Silvermind to speak to the Jhaamdathan people and reveal a grand plan by which the empire would grow and prosper. His first divine precept was the abolition of slavery, which was swiftly enacted all around the empire.</p>
<p>Laszik went on to fashion a new and powerful psionic artifact in −5725 DR . The udoxias , as it was called, permitted all psionic beings in mental contact with it to access one of the many psionic powers stored inside. Installed in the capital city, Naarkolyth , its effect reached for miles around, drawing people from far and wide to learn the novel mind magic.</p>
<p>As psionic training and knowledge flourished in Naarkolyth, Laszik established the Udoclian in −5710 DR . This university taught and promoted the Invisible Art.</p>
<p>In −5700 DR , in accordance with Auppenser's plan, Jhaamdath replaced its former oligarchy with a psiocratic system of government.</p>
<p>Finally, in −5690 DR , now of advanced years, Laszik Silvermind disappeared inexplicably. The faithful believed that the mystic had ascended in mind and body to serve the Lord of Reason directly by his side.</p>
