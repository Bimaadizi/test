<p>The Iceroot Forest lay in the far north of the Hordelands between the Shadowmount Peaks and the great Horse Plains .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Iceroot Forest was a dry forest consisting mostly of birch , elm , and larch trees. It teemed with life of all sorts, and where the trees made way for small clearings, willows , brush, and berry bushes sprung up from the fertile earth. Small rivers ran from the peaks down into the land, feeding a constant stream of nourishment into the land, until, at the very end of the woods, the waterways would run out and peter into the great plains.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The forest lay protected from the harsh storms of the Yal Tengri by the Shadowmount Peaks to the north, sheltering and nourishing this important source of lumber for the tribes.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>While no orcs lived in these woods, their bakemono and hobgoblin kin did, establishing raiding sites from which to launch out into the Horse Plains for plunder.</p>
<p>Likewise, both yu lung and chiang lung dragons lived in the rich waterways of the forest, living off the many types of beasts that inhabited this great forest, including monstrous centipedes and giant water spiders .</p>
<p>During wintertime, kala , giant lynxes , and winter wolves became active and roamed the woodlands.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
