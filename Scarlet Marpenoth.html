<p>The Scarlet Marpenoth was a submarine secretly owned by Jarlaxle Baenre . It was named for the month of Marpenoth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Scarlet Marpenoth was a red vehicle shaped like a manta ray .</p>
<p>The submarine had a top speed of 2 mph (3.2 km/h) and required a minimum crew of two in order to be properly piloted and kept. Its interior was always kept dark, so that its crew had to rely on darkvision . The ship was maintained by a crew of rock gnome engineers and run by a drow crew under Jarlaxle's command.</p>
<p>The ship's air supply circulated between all its chambers through a complex ventilation system powered by quasi-magical machinery. Its airtight doors were kept always locked.</p>
<p>The Scarlet Marpenoth's engine was a quasi-magical device that controlled the ship's depth, as well as the steering fins and rudder, and powered its propulsion system. It could be piloted from the ship's control room.</p>
<p>The ship had a defense system that allowed its outer hull to become electrified for a short period of time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to a commemorative plaque in the House of Inspired Hands , the submersible was launched in 1489 DR . The ship was designed and built in the island-nation of Lantan .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , one year before the arrival of the Sea Maidens Faire in Waterdeep , the submarine was acquired by Jarlaxle and was kept secret even to the crews of the Faire's sailing ships.</p>
