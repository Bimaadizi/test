<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Wearing splint mail in battle, Baerick fought with a black ice maul and light hammer .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baerick was a simple miner of Clan Battlehammer when he and his crew were recruited by Pallidor , a former member of the Arcane Brotherhood , to recover the corpse of Akar Kessell . However, Baerick was the first to discover the black ice, which drove him mad. Crazed, he killed all his fellows and afterward became subservient to Kessel, who had risen as a wight .</p>
<p>Under Kessel's orders, Baerick spread the black ice through the dale, corrupting many people. Meanwhile, back at Kelvin's Cairn , he questioned Stokely Silverstream 's leadership, resulting in a schism in the group. Similarly disaffected dwarves followed Baerick and departed. They established themselves in the Halls of Black Ice , where Baerick plotted to conquer all dwarves.</p>
