<p>Bitty Bitterbreath was the Chief Cook who lived in Purfbin Doogrick 's home burrow in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bitty Bitterbreath was in charge of the burrow's annual New Harvest Festival and its famous Harvest Stew and New Harvest Punch . One year, the ambitious young tinkerer Purfbin Doogrick persuaded the woman to publicly test out his new grand inventionâ€”the Shred-o-Matic 1000 . The machine was created to peel a mountain of potatoes that later were to go into the Harvest Stew. Something went awry, and the New Harvest Festival turned into a scene of carnage. Shred-o-Matic 1000 lost control, and gnomish screams could be heard for several miles. Fortunately, Purfbin Doogrick's reputation, Dame Edza 's prized wig, and Mayor Whimblesnort 's silk hat were the only fatalities.</p>
