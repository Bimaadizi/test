<p>Gruuman Xuluksh , also known as the Rage Mystic , was a veteran orc warrior in the service of the orcish god Gruumsh in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gruuman was known to have slain many enemies in honor of Gruumsh over his long career as a warrior, and he had become something of a spiritual leader among the orcs of Many-Arrows . His rages had been likened to an uncontrollable fire.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gruuman was getting old in the late 15 th century DR, but he still led the worship of Gruumsh among the Many-Arrows invaders of Neverwinter to ensure the god's continued support of their campaign. In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Gruuman became a target of Dyrl Godsword , a worshiper of Cyric , in his bid to weaken Gruumsh's influence in Neverwinter. Dyrl set about recruiting devoted clerics of good deities to hunt down Gruuman with claims that "the gods" were mad about the famous orc's presence in Neverwinter.</p>
