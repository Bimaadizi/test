<p>Corlaen Datharathi was a member of the Datharathi chaka of Durpar . He was present in the meeting which his third cousin Warian Datharathi attended in Tarsakh of 1374Â DR soon after returning to Vaelan . He rubbed his hands in unison with Sevaera Datharathi , Barden Datharathi , and Xaemar Datharathi at one point during the meeting, a gesture owed to the influence of Shaddon Datharathi .</p>
