<p>Guul Shatterneck was a bandit once active in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<p>Guul and his kin were bandits. They used the magical spears called black kumades to overwhelm their victims.</p>
<p>However, rather unwisely, they attacked members of the Gray Wolf Tribe and took them captive, not thinking to learn more about their victims first. Come the next full moon, the werewolves escaped and tore their captors apart. Thereafter, the black kumades circulated the North by 1372 DR .</p>
