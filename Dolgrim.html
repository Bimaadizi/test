<p>Dolgrims were a kind of aberration native to Eberron . They were created, reportedly through combining pairs of goblins , by the daelkyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, during a celebration of Dragondown , a group of dolgrims made an incursion into Toril . They participated in the chaos that the village of Skeefan got caught up in due to the bronze dragon Chotyn 's retaliation against what she believed to be the thieves of her egg. During this event, dolgrims could be found in Skeefan, the forest surrounding the village, the Tarlain family estate, part of the Trackless Sea coastline, and Chotyn's cavern lair.</p>
