<p>The Shrine of the Flaming Sword was an old shrine dedicated to Tempus , found within the village of Good Mead in the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The large structure was built with a distinct steeple atop its roof. It attracted large numbers of crows .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The inner walls of the shrine featured paintings that depicted Tempus wielding his flaming sword.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Brother Sharamod of the Tempuran clergy hoped to one day transform the shrine into a true and proper temple. Unfortuantely for him this would not come to pass.</p>
<p>By the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the shrine was largely empty and was only used as an occasional meeting place by the people of Good Mead. By that time, the temple only held services for Tempus during the god's holy days of the year.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Shrine of the Flaming Sword was built some time during or before the midâ€“14 th century DR. It became very popular among the Tempuran faithful during the years when Good Mead held a strong rivalry with nearby Dougan's Hole .</p>
