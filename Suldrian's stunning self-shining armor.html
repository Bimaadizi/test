<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This set of armor carried a dry rag in its right gauntlet with which it regularly polished itself, giving the set its astonishingly shiny look.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Suldrian's stunning self-shining armor possessed a single directive from its enchanter – to polish itself.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Suldrian's stunning self-shining armor was a commission by Duke Suldrian of Baldur's Gate in the Year of the Defiant Keep, 1244 DR . The duke's vanity demanded a set of armor that would project a grand and glorious image, the political believed he possessed. Inspired by the legendary hero Balduran 's image, Suldrian spared no coin in enchanting a set of worthy plate armor . As per the Duke's instructions, the armor was enchanted, animating it in a similar manner as regular animated armors were created to perform simple tasks for their masters or scare intruders away. The armor was given one direction – to polish itself once it suffered any sully, scratches, or scuffs, and the enchanted assured Suldrian that the animated armor could still be worn in public, and it was at every possible opportunitym during the city's functions and the Flaming Fist mercenary company's ceremonies, despite only holding an insignificant rank within it.</p>
<p>However, Suldrian's stunning self-shining armor had the opposite effect on the Duke's image. He became a laughing stock among some critics who liked to point out the difference between the illustrious magic armor and the unsightly man inside it. In the infamous Bread Riots of the Year of the Bold Knight, 1249 DR broke out in the Gate, Duke saw it as an opportunity to prove his critics wrong. Wielding a newly forged magic hammer , riding a massive grey stallion , and leading a squad of Flaming Fists, Duke fought the rioters in the event that would be remembered as Suldrian's Charge . It was an initial success as the third of the rioters fled at the mere sight of the shining knight. The tide quickly turned with someone launched a missile from the crowd at the armored Duke (the missile's nature was debated and also became a common tavern joke and a topic of many raunchy songs). One thing was known about the missile – it was unclean. Of course, the armor's only directive activated, and, to the wearer's protestations, the animated armor began polishing itself with the closest banner it could grab. Fighting against the armor's movements, Suldrian fell off his horse, and his erratic behavior scared the Flaming Fists away, thinking the leader was affected by some foul magic. Duke Suldrian was left alone with a rioting mob, and rioting mobs were not known for their mercy.</p>
<p>When the riots ended, Duke Suldrian's body was found, still encased in a spotlessly shone armor that was untouched by the mob. Historians speculated that the mob was scared off by the fact that, in their eyes, the Duke refused to die even after countless deadly wounds, continuing to move and shine his armor.</p>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Suldrian's stunning self-shining armor belonged to Mintassan the Magnificent, and was proudly displayed in his shop, Mintassan's Mysteries, on Westgate's Market Triangle .</p>
