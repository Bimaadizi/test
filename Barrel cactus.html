<h2>Description</h2>

Desert travelers and inhabitants knew to remove the barrel cactus pulp and mash it to extract drinkable water. Each cactus held several pints of water. Some travelers cut cactus flesh into small pieces to be sucked on. However, accidental swallowing of barrel cactus was inadvisable. The plant flesh caused serious stomach cramps if swallowed.</p>
