<p>Aphelda's vendor golem was a construct creature what was capable of functioning as a shopkeep on behalf of its creator.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A vendor golem performed all tasks that a real shopkeep did on a daily basis. They could purchase, sell, and haggle over the store's stock. Skilled wizard store keeps left these strange creatures in charge of their stores. Leomund's merchant elemental was a similar creature and a viable alternative. Some claimed that unlike Leomund 's elemental , Aphelda 's construct was a mercantile pushover.</p>
