While the caravan was halted the group managed to make camp, receiving stalwart protection from "Dusty" Yates , the sergeant of the caravan guard. They remained pinned down without supplies for a time, unable to send runners for aid due to the tracking skills of the Blackdagger gnoll trackers. Fortunately, Melkhor Goldseeker sought aid from a local adventurer that worked with Sergeant Yates to reverse their fates.</p>
