<p>The Startled Stag was a strange cursed stag statue created sometime before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Startled Stag was a 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms), two-and-a-half feet tall, bronze statue that depicted a terrified stag. The statue was hollowed on the inside and hid a bottle or a similar receptacle. The bottle's neck with the stopper could be accessed between the stag's shoulder blades.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If anyone were to remove the stopper from between the stag's shoulder blades, a clear, odorless gas escaped the bottle. The only evidence of the gas was its sulfurus taste of rotten eggs . The gas affected every breathing creature within ten to forty minutes, freezing them in place. This paralysis lasted for a period of time between one and twenty days.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Startled Stag was one of the more unique items available from the Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop in the Living City, Raven's Bluff , run by Misti Morgan , a proprietor of the establishment and a thief , in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
