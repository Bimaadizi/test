<p>The Shad'iar was a type of small warhorse that were native to the Land of the Lions . They were bred from Calimite and Lhesperan stock and named for the nomadic tribe of the same region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These compact horses were strong, hardy and extremely sure-footed. For generations, they had been trained for battle and were steadfast in combat.</p>
<p>They fed only on the tall grasses of their native land but enjoyed carrots , radishes and kohlrabi as treats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These noble horses were an intrinsic part the Shad'iar culture and were revered by the nomadic people. This relationship between riders and steed was entwined in the tribe's cultural history and lore. The horses were never sold to those outside the tribe but fetched a handsome sum, over 1000 gp , when sold between tribe members.</p>
