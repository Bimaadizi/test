<p>Oscray were a group of scro found on the Ravannah Savannah of the Malatran Plateau .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scro bore a resemblance to the average orc , but were larger and had greyish skin. They had tusks, which were often filed to a sharp point.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The minds of oscray were typically well suited to combat, being disciplined and having a type of cunning that was rooted in strategy and tactics. They always looked out for each other above all else.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Oscray were known to fight with the typical Malatran weaponry of daggers , handaxes , shortbows , long knives , long spears , and half-spears . They often made a point to insult their enemies. They forged chainmail and many weapons from brass .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The oscray were descended from a group of scro who had fled on spelljamming vessels from their far off war with the Elven Imperial Fleet .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The oscray engaged in some level of agriculture, though they primarily relied upon hunting. They were one of the few groups in Malatra known to work with brass and bronze , fashioning them from the land's rare deposits of copper , zinc , and casserite . Though a more complex process, the oscray also worked with meteoric iron . And they repurposed any gold or silver they found within ruins.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<p>All oscray lived within a village in the Ravannah Savannah of the Malatran Plateau , well to the north of the territory of the Wise Ones tribe of Nubari . They also operated a zinc mine within the Great Rift and a casserite mine close to their home, the latter of which they rendered into tin for the production of bronze.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>At first the oscray relied upon smelting down their own possessions and stripping down their spelljammers for brass, but eventually established trade relations with the aarakocra of the Forbidden Mountains . The aarakocra would scan the mountains for any raw copper ore they could find and once they collected 20 pounds (9,100 grams) worth of copper they would make the long trek to the oscray village. They traded this copper with the oscray in return for brass javelin heads, which were considered an item of prestige among the aarakocra of the Forbidden Mountains.</p>
