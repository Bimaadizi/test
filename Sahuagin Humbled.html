<p>The Walking Statue of Waterdeep known as the Sahuagin Humbled was originally the only Walking Statue visible in Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Walking Statue was a 90‑foot-tall (27‑meter) stone colossus. It was one of a set of eight such constructs in Waterdeep.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The statue was positioned on Gull Leap at the western end of Julthoon Street in Waterdeep by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun (the creator of the statue and most of its brethren ) to help defend the city.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After defending the city from a sahuagin invasion in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Khelben reshaped the statue into the image of a sahuagin, moved it to the base of Mount Waterdeep , and had it pose down on one knee showing reverence toward the House of Heroes on the far side of the Field of Triumph to the north.</p>
