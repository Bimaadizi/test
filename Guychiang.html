<p>The Guychiang were a nomadic tribe of humans living on the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands . They were among the tribes mistakenly called " Tuigan " by outsiders following the Horde Wars .</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>They made their home around the city of Peqqir in the taiga of the northern Plain of Horses, near the foot of the Chigidi Mountains and with the Anai River flowing past.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Although a minor tribe of the Plain of Horses, the Guychiang were expert farmers who employed advanced irrigation methods to grow grains , vegetables , cotton , and mulberry trees, the leaves of which were used in the production of silk . In addition, they mined iron and jade from the nearby Chigidi Mountains and manufactured weapons , quality jewelry, and leather products. They made Peqqir perhaps the most industrious settlement in all the Plain of Horses as of Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) and were jealously protective of it.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>They spoke the Chuchian tongue.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After he first appeared in the Plain of Horses around Shou Year 2592 (1342 DR) , the nomad lama Torgoja P'a stopped in Peqqir, where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful Guychiang offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a passed on it and continued on his way. He would become High Lama of Mount Or-Ghash around Shou Year 2597 (1347 DR) .</p>
