<p>A scholarly weretiger , referred to as a librarian , that was active in the Sword Coast in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his weretiger form the librarian wore a red tunic , a pair of spectacles , a belt around the waist that had books latched to it, footwraps, and a single leather bracer that had compartments for carrying three scrolls .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He considered his lycanthropy to be a blessing, rather than a curse , and would interject with this belief whenever anyone referred to it as being a curse.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime around the Year of the Purple Dragons, 1493 DR , this weretiger was living among a group of Beshaba worshiping lycanthropes that had taken over a ruined temple deep in the darkest reaches of the Neverwinter Woods , acting as the steward of the temple's library. The group went about afflicting the condition upon the locals, including Pavel Nonov .</p>
<p>One day a group of adventurers entered the Neverwinter Woods in search of a missing woman by the name Kara Bakovski . They encountered the hunter Randal Amberwood , who informed them that he had tracked beasts down to the abandoned temple. Once they made it to the temple the adventurers found Kara in the company of a werewolf and moved to attack it, but she yelled at them to stop and explained that the beast was her fiance. Introducing himself as Pavel Nonov, the werewolf expressed a desire to be cured of his lycanthropy. After expressing that they would need a scroll of remove curse , Pavel suggested the group might be able to find something in the temple's disorganized library. They rummaged through its shelves a bit, finding a copy of Volo's Guide to Lycanthropy , but once realizing that they weren't fellow lycanthropes the weretiger attacked them.</p>
<p>Having survived his encounter with the adventurers and with his group dismantled, the weretiger fled the Neverwinter Woods. He eventually made his way into the Arcane Chambers of Undermountain , seeking to research the lost lore held within books on that level. Unperturbed by the gibbering mouthers and nothics that inhabited the level, the weretiger continued his studies for well over a year.</p>
<p>Around the Year of Twelve Warnings, 1494 DR , a group of adventurers were traveling through the Arcane Chambers in search of Nihiloor and encountered several gibbering mouthers gathered around a bin of books. Their fighting garnered the attention of the weretiger librarian, irritated at the disturbance, and the two groups recognized each other from the temple back in Neverwinter Woods. The group pleaded that they had no quarrel with him, but having fallen under the sway of Undermountain's madness the weretiger lept into combat against the adventurers.</p>
