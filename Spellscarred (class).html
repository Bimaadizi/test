<p>A spellscar was a mark or scar on an individual who was exposed to the Spellplague . It was a mild form of plaguechange that had the potential to grant unique magical powers to the afflicted individual. Such individuals were referred to as spellscarred , and some among them trained to master their powers.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While spellscars could sometimes include physical abnormalities or injuries—such as blue scar tissue or strange runes on the skin —they were not necessarily accompanied by the types of bodily and mental deformities seen in other victims of the Spellplague. More commonly, they were invisible and intangible until activated, at which point they were characterized by a blue glow or blue flames. These flames might appear as jagged cracks on the skin, symbols or brands on the face, or even as halos or wings.</p>
<p>Spellscars were charged with powerful arcane energy. While there were some who strove to master their spellscars, activating them and using their power as they saw fit, others tried to conceal their scars and struggled to suppress unwanted activations, which might occur in times of stress. The activation of a spellscar could cause physical sensations ranging from itching to debilitating pain, although the blue flames of a spellscar did not burn or seriously injure the afflicted individual.</p>
<h3>Acquisition</h3>
<p>Acquiring a spellscar was the result of coming into contact with the Spellplague, most often in the form of an extended period of exposure to a plagueland . Only some plaguechanged individuals acquired a spellscar: they generally occurred in about one in ten individuals exposed to the Spellplague, and more commonly in those who had come into contact with less virulent versions of the Spellplague's energies and/or recovered from a severe case of a Spellplague-caused disease known as creeping madness . In some cases, a spellscar could manifest many years after an individual was exposed to the Spellplague, or even in people who had never come into direct contact with the Spellplague, although these were usually arcane spellcasters of some kind. Spellscars could also be inherited from a parent or ancestor, sometimes skipping one or more generations before reappearing.</p>
<p>The first appearance or emergence of a spellscar could be traumatizing. The event was sometimes accompanied by an eruption of plaguefire that disfigured the spellscarred individual and others nearby, or in some cases, caused the destruction of people and places in the immediate vicinity. Individuals who experienced such a catastrophic awakening of their spellscar were known as spellscarred harbingers , and were often feared and hated for the destruction that they had unintentionally caused.</p>
<p>While any creature could become spellscarred, humanoids were more likely than most to acquire one. They were also known to manifest in fey , giants , goblinoids , illithids , kobolds , lizardfolk , marine creatures , wyverns , and even undead . It was possible to acquire more than one spellscar.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Merely having a spellscar allowed afflicted individuals to sense the presence of the Spellplague nearby, but those spellscarred who wished to manifest more powerful, strange, and unique abilities had to train to do so. There were many ways to go about trying to wield or master a spellscar, and in many cases a spellscar's power would manifest in a way that was consistent or compatible with the afflicted individual's strengths. Many spellscarred individuals' lifespans were extended by one to two decades, and in rare cases, this longevity was inherited by their children.</p>
<p>While the powers bestowed by spellscars were generally beneficial to the afflicted individual, the use of a spellscar often came with a cost. Activation could be painful, and simply possessing a spellscar could attract the unwanted attention of abominations associated with the Spellplague, such as the Masters of Absolute Accord . Having a spellscar generally rendered the bearer more susceptible to the energies of the Spellplague, including the attacks of plaguechanged creatures and the powers of other spellscars. Even so, they also conferred protection against many of the most negative effects of Spellplague. Spellscarred individuals were not susceptible to the fatal consequences of prolonged exposure to a plagueland, they were immune to Halruaan Consumption , and they were wholly unappetizing to plaguechanged ghouls . Some spellscarred individuals suffered from disturbing dreams or bizarre visions which sometimes conveyed obscure secrets about the nature of magic. Activating a spellscar within the confines of a mythal caused that mythal to treat the spellscarred individual as an intruder within its field.</p>

Some could grant themselves additional powers by focusing their spellscar's energies, such as by funneling the blue flames to their eyes to see invisibility or gain 360-degree darkvision , to their feet to gain extra speed, to their hands to extend their reach, or to their weapons to augment their strikes. Others manifested abilities that could warp or deform reality in some way, sometimes similar to polymorph spells or perhaps allowing them to teleport short distances , turn invisible , bend probability to their advantage, or disrupt magic altogether.</p>
<p>With sufficient training, so-called spellscarred savants could overcome many of the inherent limitations of their spellscars, and even tap into spellfire to heal themselves and energize or vaporize others as they saw fit. While potent, spellscars did not generally confer the types of monstrous power seen in creatures that had been plaguechanged in more extreme fashion.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Spellscars first appeared in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , as a consequence of the Spellplague. The initial wave of the Spellplague often caused more extreme mutations than just spellscars, but in the following years, the scars became more common among those exposed to pockets of the Spellplague, and spellscarred individuals could be encountered all across Toril and Abeir . Spellscars were particularly common among the tribes of Elfharrow , in Samarach , near the Plaguewrought Land in the Vilhon Wilds , and in the Underdark , such as in Ch'Chitl , the Deep Wastes , and Earthroot .</p>
<p>Spellscarred and plaguechanged individuals were often viewed as abominations, and as harbingers of fear and madness. Thus, they were often treated as outcasts, regardless of their own attitude toward their spellscar. In the North , High Forest scouts were specially trained to eliminate spellscarred targets, while in the cities, the spellscarred were often quarantined in some fashion: Waterdeep preferred them to stay in Skullport or the slums of Mistshore , Baldur's Gate unofficially quarantined them to Scarred Alley outside the city walls, and Neverwinter held them first in a treatment center in the House of Knowledge before exiling them to Helm's Hold per the controversial " Protector's Law ". Helm's Hold was the closest thing to a safe haven for spellscarred individuals, but even there they were not allowed in some taverns and faced a growing movement to expel them because of their "impurity". Elsewhere across Faerûn , the spellscarred were seen as lesser members of society in Amn and as deformed in the Moonsea . In Impiltur , they were hunted by the mighty demonslayers , and in Turmish , the Emerald Enclave ruthlessly killed them, viewing their spellscars as blights against the natural order. Meanwhile, as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the wizards of Deep Imaskar were experimenting on spellscarred individuals, and their research had produced wards that prevented people with spellscars from entering their city without a password and had also led them to develop a way to remove spellscars entirely .</p>
<p>Still, there were those who were proud of their spellscars, or at least driven to stand up for themselves, such as the Heirs of Azure in Helm's Hold. Furthermore, there were ordinary people who actually desired spellscars for themselves. In the century between the Wailing Years and the Second Sundering , some sought to obtain spellscars through " Scar Pilgrimages ", in which they intentionally exposed themselves to a plagueland in hopes of acquiring a spellscar. These were often facilitated by the Order of Blue Flame , an organization with hidden motives that was outwardly dedicated to treating, educating, and caring for their fellow spellscarred and plaguechanged individuals.</p>
<p>With the return of Mystra in the late 15 th century DR , spellscars ceased to function as the Spellplague began to dissipate. Those who had visible scars or marks found that they now appeared as mundane but vivid tattoos , which in rare cases might glow when they cast arcane spells . In the years following the Second Sundering , many spellscars faded—and, in rare cases, even disappeared entirely—while others gained new magical properties.</p>
