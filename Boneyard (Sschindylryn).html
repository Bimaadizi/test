<p>The Boneyard was a charnel cave and killing field on the outskirts of the drow city of Sschindylryn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Boneyard was a large cavern, the floor of which was covered with the haphazardly-scattered remains of dead mortals, from the fresh and bloody to the ancient and dusty. It was used as a kind of graveyard by Sschindylryn, specifically a convenient place to dump the remains of fallen drowâ€” slaves , prisoners, and others who didn't warrant a proper burial. Its true purpose however was that of an outer line of defense for the city, as the massed bones and flesh made an ideal source of material for drow necromancers to animate on the spot and send at invaders. This was aided by the presence of at least one sacrificial altar used for more formal rituals.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The cavern was located near a primary portal that led directly into Sschindylryn, adjoining several more traditional drow fortifications that faced out into the wider Underdark .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>At any moment the Boneyard might be "home" to any amount of shambling zombies and skeletons , either left to their own devices or being led along by drow necromancers. During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , human undead joined the ranks of the defenders, drawn from the common folk of Eveningstar as well as Purple Dragons and War Wizards . Arch-Necromancer Phinrae Szind looked after the area, joined by a team of other grand necromancers and their minions.</p>
