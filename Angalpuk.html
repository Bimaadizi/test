<p>Angalpuk , also called the " Eastern Basin ", was one of the three regions of the Great Glacier .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Angalpuk was located in the eastern Great Glacier. It was a very flat land with a scattering of mountains and forests.</p>
<h2>Flora & Fauna</h2>
<p>Angalpuk had more vegetation than any other part of the Great Glacier, with small forests of birch , evergreens and willow . The trees rarely grew as tall as their southern cousins, usually topping out at 10 feet (3 meters) in height. . Caribou were plentiful in Angalpuk, numbering in the thousands. The black sled dog, also known as the okteff , was native to Angalpuk.</p>
<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>Average temperatures in Angalpuk ranged from −40​ to ​25 ℉ (−40​ to ​−3.9 ℃ ) from Mirtul to Kythorn . In the month of Flamerule , temperatures ranged from −10​ to ​40 ℉ (−23​ to ​4.4 ℃ ). During the months of Eleasis through Uktar , they ranged from −45​ to ​10 ℉ (−43​ to ​−12 ℃ ).</p>
<p>The winters were bitter and long. Temperatures fell as low as −85 ℉ (−65 ℃ ) from Nightal to Tarsakh and rarely rose any higher than −20 ℉ (−29 ℃ ). Strong winds could make them temperatures seem even colder. Angalpuk received the most precipitation of any other region in the Great Glacier.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Angalpuk was home to the Angulutiuns, a nomadic race of caribou-herders. The society of the Angulutiuns was intricately linked to their caribou herds. They relied on the caribou for food, milk, clothing, and other materials, and their year revolved around the migration patterns of the animals.</p>
<p>Most tribes had fewer than 200 members. The largest tribe in Angalpuk had 800 members. Every tribe maintained its own herd of caribou—from a few dozen to almost three thousand.</p>
<p>Larger tribes, with more than 200 individuals, would maintain permanent villages called skotuk . The term skotuk referred to both the people and the animals. They remained in these villages over winter, when the ground was too frozen for caribou to feed. The caribou remained in the forest during this time.</p>
<p>When the village migrated with their caribou, beginning in the spring, they were called iskotuk , while the weak, very young, and elderly left behind were called aiskotuk .</p>
<p>A full migration, one year, was called an ikili . During this time, a herd and its tribe would move slowly, wandering and feeding, covering between ten and twenty miles (16 to 32 kilometers). The herders would ensure the protection of the caribou from predators and guide them to the best feeding grounds where the ground was least frozen. They would also help with the birthing of calves in the summer months. New calves were branded with a wakiak by clipping patterns in the ears or cutting marks in the hooves. In the fall, they would journey home, where some caribous were selected for breeding purposes and others were slaughtered for meat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −1186 DR , a faction of Iulutiuns split off and migrated east to Angalpuk to become the Angulutiuns.</p>
<p>The fifty-year long Keryjek Wars began after an especially bitter winter in −963 DR left many Iulutiun villages hungry and suffering. In response, a number of them gathered together and formed a large raiding party. They crossed into Angulutiun territory and targeted the large caribou herds those tribes tended. This act started the war, which would result in fifty years of fighting between the two groups of Ulutiuns.</p>
<p>In 460 DR , a deadly plague was brought to Angalpuk by treasure hunters from Sossal . The disease decimated the Angulutiuns and caribou populations.</p>
