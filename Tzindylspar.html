<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountain that marked the location of the city was unremarkable, one of many in the western Nether Mountains northeast of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Halflings also dwelt here.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A rich corundum vein gave the city its name and brief prestige. A portal was created connecting Tzindylspar with Calimshan , and a thriving trade in rubies commenced, lasting until the fall of the Cajaan dynasty in -1428 DR . Ynamalik Nadim came through the portal with an army of monsters and conquered Tzindylspar in -1427 DR . Between -665 DR and 620 DR , three powerful earthquakes collapsed the tunnels leading to the surface, opened passages into the Fardrimm , and killed various forces occupying the city.</p>
