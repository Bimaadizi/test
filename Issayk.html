<p>Issayk was the most infamous forger in Skullport .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Issayk could forge the most perfect false documents in the Realms . Thanks to his web of contacts across Faer√ªn , he was always informed of coming changes in the bureaucracy of a particular kingdom. Issayk also obtained wax pressings of seals of the governments of Calimport , Luskan , Waterdeep , Cormyr , and Sembia . Obviously, his prices were very high but the true mystery was what happened to all the money Issayk earned, as nobody ever saw him with more than petty cash.</p>
