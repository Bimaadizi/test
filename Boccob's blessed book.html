<p>Boccob's blessed book was a well-made and highly prized variety of spellbooks , named for the Oerthian deity Boccob .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These books were quite durable and waterproof. They were bound with iron overlaid with silver and had locks. And they contained over a thousand pages.</p>
<p>A Boccob's blessed book was small in size, typically measuring 12 inches (30 centimeters) tall, 6​ to ​8 inches (15​ to ​20 centimeters) wide, and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) thick. Though some were a mere 6 inches (15 centimeters) in height.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Unlike a normal spellbook, Boccob's blessed book did not require the use of costly materials to inscribe spells upon its pages.</p>
<h2>Crafting</h2>
<p>Creating one of these books required knowledge of how to craft wondrous items and the spell secret page .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point prior to the 14 th century DR , an evil magic-user on Toril possessed one of these books and was slain in the caverns of Deepearth by demons . Years later, a group of adventurers would come across their mummified corpse and spectre , retrieving from it the Boccob's blessed book .</p>
