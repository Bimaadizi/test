<p>A guisarme ( pronounced : / g w i ˈ z ɑːr m / gwee-ZARM ) was a two-handed, martial, melee weapon of the pole arm family.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The basic guisarme was a weaponized pruning hook mounted on a long pole. It might or might not have a back spike. The convex edge (outside curve) was sharpened for slicing all the way up to the point of the hook.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>The guisarme was a pole arm so it required two hands to wield. Being a reach weapon, it was capable of striking targets as far away as 10 feet (3 meters). The hook might be used to attempt to trip an enemy or pull a rider off a mount. The back spike could be used for parrying or for a sideways swinging attack, but the guisarme was primarily an offensive slashing weapon. This weapon required training to use and was classified as a martial weapon.</p>
