<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of these ancient elven halberds made its way into the Halls of Light of Myth Drannor's Dwarven Dungeons following the centuries past the Weeping War . It was believed that a certain variant of a halberd of vigilance was tossed away because the magic weapon continued to shout distressfully "ALARM! POTENCY FILLS ME LIKE A SONG OF HOPE!" In 1369 DR , that halberd of vigilance was wielded by a spectre against the adventurers from Phlan known as the Veiled Ones . In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a halberd of vigilance belonged to Lann Tarv , an eloquent bugbear merchant and a member of the dreaded Cult of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers of the Western Heartlands .</p>
