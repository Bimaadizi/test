<p>Sonjar was an artificer , and a senior wizard in service to the Lord Artificer during the last days of Imaskar . Sonjar's Tower was his residence.</p>
<p>Per a sign on his abode, Sonjar called it the Amethyst Tower. His tower was built inside a geode; he was initially attracted to it by the concentration of earth power that it embodied.</p>
<p>Sonjar owned many slaves; after his death, four of them perished in the barracks and his favourite became a curst . His chief cook ran away to join the Mulhorandi uprising. He also kept a few monsters, which he prized. The artificer experimented on kidnapped priests; his last victim had been a Netherese priest of Moander . His trophy room included the bone of a dinosaur , the skull of a beholder , a complete elf skeleton, and the preserved head of some angelic creature.</p>
<p>Sonjar had created a demiplane , almost half a mile in diameter, to hold an orchard where he grew fruit trees such as apples and pears , and also kept honey bees .</p>
