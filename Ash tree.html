<p>Ash trees were seemingly sentient trees that attacked travelers in the Burning Woods of the Shadowfell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These trees appeared blackened and glowing with crackling, ever-burning fire. They were further suffused with harmful necromantic energy.</p>
<p>These trees were firmly rooted to the ground and could not be harmed by any fire -, necrotic-, or psychic -based magic , nor did poisons affect them. However, it was possible to temporarily stun an ash tree by causing it to become magically cold .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>They behaved as if sentient and angry, lashing out at any creature that came within range of their 15‑foot (4.6‑meter) flaming branches. Anything ensnared by the tree was pulled back toward the burning trunk.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Far from simply undead and burning trees, new ash trees could sprout as burning saplings and grow into full trees. As such, they could potentially be found not only throughout the Burning Wood, but inside the city of Evernight .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ash trees first appeared when the Burning Woods were created during the events of the Ruining in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR : when Mount Hotenow erupted on the Material Plane , its Shadowfell twin did as well, and never stopped.</p>
