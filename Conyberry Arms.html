Martin also specialized in cheap blacksmithing, like making shoddy horseshoes , or locks which could only be opened with crowbars . His best made items were actually crowbars.</p>

<p>As of 1367 DR , it was rumored Martin hired a low-level thief with a ring of invisibility to walk around stealing small items off the belts of customers in his shop.
