<p>Mormesk was a human mage and the last defending wizard against Uruth Ukrypt 's raid on the Wave Echo Cave . He was turned into a wraith that haunted the cavern for over half a millennium.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The human wizard was said to be a powerful spellcaster. He coveted treasure and wealth, both in life and in undeath . As well as general wealth, Mormesk desired magical equipment, such as spellbooks , but also longed for arcane knowledge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 951 DR , the mountain orcs of Uruth Ukrypt along with mercenary wizards laid waste to the village of Phandalin . They descended to the Wave Echo Cave, where Mormesk was currently staying. An explosive spell battle broke out, and many combatants on both sides were slain. Mormesk held out the longest, slinging spells at the incoming horde, but eventually fell.</p>
<p>After his fall, he was transformed into an evil ghostly apparition, a wraith. His hatred and anger fuelled this change, and Mormesk rose up to lead the undead of the cavern. He stayed in the quarters of the visiting wizards, wishing that the spectator lurking in the Forge of Spells would be dealt with. His undead units had been unable to gain victory over the beholderkin . The wraith was even willing to part with his coins and gems , and even let the party peruse his books, which he much favored. However, he would not give up his wooden and platinum pipe.</p>
