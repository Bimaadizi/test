<p>Tribal Warrior 5e 5th Edition Statistics Size Medium Type Humanoid Alignment Any Challenge rating 1/8 General Information Language(s) Any one language Tribal Warrior or savage warrior , was a broad term for a type of fighter or warrior that lived beyond "civilization", in societies that were considered "primitive" by some Faer√ªnian perspectives, the unifying factors being low technological progress and a lack of agriculture. For example, it would be extremely unlikely to encounter such warriors in the Dalelands or on the Rock of Bral . The term could also refer to warriors who originated from such cultures and maintained a connection to them whilst living in another land or culture.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Savage warriors were considered by some to be comparatively more technologically "primitive" than barbarians or berserkers , more distanced from civilization, and more in tuned with nature. This perceived "primitivism" of the savage warrior's tribal culture was not reflective of its moral, ethical, or alignment values. A "savage" tribe could easily be a peaceful people with a highly developed culture and sense of artistry.</p>
<p>The regions and cultures in the Realms where one could encounter those labeled as "savage warriors" included Evermeet among the most savage members of the green elves , some of the Chultans living within the wild jungles of Chult , some of the people of the Savage Frontier like the Uthgardt , and the Mazticans of Maztica .</p>
<p>While some warriors could be found in tribal societies, a savage warrior could also be someone who was raised by animals in the wilderness. The tribes that hosted savage warriors varied considerably, having in common only that they were less technologically advanced than other cultures in the Realms and generally did not engage in agriculture, instead subsisting upon foraging, fishing, and hunting. While some may not have taken to metallurgy, other societies could be users of bronze or iron . Some societies may have members that acted in accordance with the wishes of a ruling chief, who was either their greatest or oldest warrior or an individual who had been blessed by gods . Others may live along rivers, valuing the use of canoes , or be nomadic and value horseriding .</p>
<p>A savage warrior could be of nearly any sentient race, including humans and the various demihuman races. This type of warrior was particularly common among neanderthals .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They were highly versatile among the various types of warriors in the Realms, as survival in the wilderness necessitated being skilled in a wide range of disciplines. These skills usually fell within the purview of the arts of fishing, forestry, hunting, and trapping. Additionally, many were able to perform a spell -like ability, most commonly resembling either alarm , animal friendship , detect evil , or detect magic . This ability was not truly a form of magic and detect magic effects would not register it as such.</p>
<p>With the exception of detect evil , these abilities differed subtly from the spells they resembled. Alarm would merely alert the warrior of activity, not set off an actual alarm. Animal friendship required the warrior to get up close and personal with their target and needed two castings if an animal was angry with, or threatened by, the warrior. And detect magic could not determine the school of magic of detected magics.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The weaponry typically found in the hands of a savage warrior included the likes of blowguns (mainly in jungle environs), clubs , daggers , javelins , knives , longbows , shortbows , slings , spears , handaxes , throwing axes , and quarterstaves . Depending on the culture a warrior came from their weapons could be made out of bone, stone, bronze, or iron. In terms of clothing and armor , they often garbed themselves in what was common among the culture they came from, such as hide armor . The garments of "civilized" societies were perceived to be cumbersome and uncomfortable to savage warriors, negatively impacting their ability to concentrate in the heat of battle.</p>
