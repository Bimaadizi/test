<p>A forge chant was a kind of cooperative spell used only by dwarves .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Forge chants were long and difficult to use in combat, but were all cooperative spells that could be bolstered by the singing of dwarves.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p>There were two kinds of dwarves who could employ forge chants. Forge priests were one kind, and they could use any such spell; other dwarves could still access forge chants, but they needed to be quite skilled at singing. Those dwarves who were skilled at singing could only access the least of all chants, basically just hammer and miner's chant , on their own. However, through the hammer chant, up to seven singers could combine their powers, accessing a variety of forge chants. These spells were never useable by nondwarves.</p>
