<p>Rhylfang was a gargantuan , demonic spider said to be a spawn of Lolth .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Due to the fiendish magic infused within them, the webs spun by Rhylfang were too sturdy to be cut through or burned away by means of fire or acid . Rhylfang was also capable of spawning spiders of many different species, such as giant spiders and phase spiders .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some centuries prior to the 15 th century DR , Rhylfang was trapped deep within a keep in the bogs of the Evermoors . She laid dormant there for so long that she had become a mere myth among the elves that still knew of her.</p>
<p>In 1490 DR , Tasyllys Ch'fyr and his group of drow cultists entered that keep in hopes of gaining access to its fabled portal to the Forlorn Cliffs . In the process they awakened Rhylfang from its ancient slumber, who went on to spawn dozens of spiders that went out and terrorized the surrounding land of the Evermoors.</p>
<p>Soon after a group of adventurers tracking down Tasyllys were tasked by a woman named Andra with gathering ingredients necessary to brew an acid strong enough to melt through the webs encasing its keep. Afterwards they discovered that she was a Ghaunadaur worshiper seeking to put an end to Rhylfang herself. After defeating both her and many of Tasyllys's cultists, the adventurers confronted Rhylfang and put an end to her.</p>
