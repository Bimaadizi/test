<p>Brigganocks were a species of tiny fey whose spirits manifested outside of their bodies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brigganocks were about the size of mice . They always had a bulb of pale light—their spirit—nearby their body.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Brigganocks were frantic but inoffensive creatures, and were generally benevolent towards others.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like other fey, brigganocks were difficult to charm and impossible to render asleep via magic . However, they lacked the typical low-light vision or darkvision because their surroundings were always lit by their spirit-light, which illuminated 10 feet (3 meters) with bright light, and which they could move with a thought up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) away for short periods of time. The brigganock could not dim nor hide their spirit-light, and it faded away when the brigganock died.</p>
<p>Brigganocks had an unusual ability to accelerate time around themselves, allowing them to accomplish one hour's worth of work in a matter of seconds. However, this ability took a toll on them, requiring them to rest between each usage, and the whole of the activity had to happen within a 10‑foot (3‑meter) cube of space.</p>
<p>Brigganocks could naturally cast minor illusion and spare the dying at will, and animal friendship , faerie fire , meld into stone , and silence each once per day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When they had to fight, brigganocks relied on their natural spellcasting ability and their pickaxes .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Brigganocks spent most of their time seeking out the wish-stones that formed underground in the Feywild . They refined these stones into gems that they used to decorate their buildings and items, or traded them to other fey for food or favors. Brigganocks only kept wish-stones formed from good intentions; they discarded those formed from malevolent wishes. Brigganocks preferred to eat lettuce , cheese , and other soft foods; they ate a considerable amount of food compared to their small size.</p>
