<p>Orlsfall was a mining town turned ghost town in northern Amn .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Orlsfall sat below the eastern Cloud Peaks on the north side of the Ridge , not far northwest of the Giants' Dance . It was about two days travel northeast of Amnwater , and an equal distance northwest from Keczulla .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The town was named after a heroic miner who saved seven fellow miners before himself being killed in a cave-in. The town grew rapidly in a rush to exploit the mine, and was then abandoned when the mine ran dry. It remained uninhabited until just before 1370 DR , when opportunistic bandits led by Timok the Tusk moved in. Although not quite notorious enough to warrant an assault from nearby Citadel Rashturl , their raids on the nearby Greenfields and growing numbers meant that this was likely to change.</p>
