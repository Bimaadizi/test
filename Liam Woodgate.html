<p>Liam Woodgate was the best fighter in Auckney and a trusted worker of Lord Feringal Auck in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Liam was a grey-bearded gnome with great fighting skill. The gnome was highly respected by his lord and was assigned important tasks, which no others in the lord's residence were included in. He was incredibly confident, rarely being bested in combat, and believed he could beat the gargantuan barbarian , Wulfgar , in fair one-on-one combat, despite his small stature.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , the gnome fighter was given the important task of transporting Meralda Ganderlay , Lord Feringal's wife-to-be, from the village of Auckney to the noble's residence, Castle Auck . The area between them was a few miles in breadth and was populated by beasts and highwaymen.</p>
<p>On one of his later trips, the loyal carriage driver was intercepted by Morik the Rogue and Wulfgar, two men down on their luck after being forced out of Luskan . The pair, who had resulted to brigandage, spotted the carriage. Wulfgar immediately realized Liam was a veteran fighter and thus the barbarian set up a trap, which ended in the coach being toppled over and Meralda and coin being taken. The gnome was knocked unconscious and, as a result, the brigands took Meralda with them to give them time to escape, and then released her back to Liam. He believed he had failed his lord, but there was nothing else he could do in such a situation.</p>
<p>Later, Meralda falsely accused Wulfgar of rape but claimed not to remember his face. Lord Feringal sent out a wizard to capture the barbarian, who returned him to the castle. Liam explained that this man was definitely the brigand who'd captured Meralda, and Lord Feringal Auck sentenced Wulfgar to torture, castration, and death. However, Meralda freed the barbarian from prison.</p>
<p>When Wulfgar and Morik returned to vouch for Meralda's innocence, Liam challenged the barbarian in combat. Liam drew his sword , and attacked, thrust and feigned. He was bested by Wulfgar but revealed no information to the huge man, claiming he'd rather die.</p>
