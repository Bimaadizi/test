<p>The Think Easy was a social club attached to the Gehirn Cibus restaurant deep in the Underdark , owned and operated by the mind flayer entrepreneur Brikhalna "Dutch" Ipprszhen .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Think Easy served as a select club for Dutch's friends, business partners, and other trusted associates. Because his social circle was made up of gangsters and crime-lords, he enforced the civility of his patrons by the threat of an elite team of drow assassins. This ensured that the Think Easy was kept a safe neutral ground, and high-stakes business deals could be conducted peacefully at his tables.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After earning great wealth as an independent businessman, Dutch became part-owner of the Gehirn Cibus restaurant, already a famed and popular Underdark location. Later, he opened up the attached Think Easy as a way of expanding his business.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Aside from Dutch himself, prominent clients of the Think Easy included drow matriarch Felyndiira "Mad Money" Shi'narrvha , the hit man beholder Vikhrumn "100 Gold" Coll , the deep gnome fence Gnormahlenvaey "Squeaky" Catoneriehn , and the assassin Gray'shivnarien "the Fiddler" Taliain . The Fidder was fond of taking the stage at the club and taking requests from the audienceâ€”a disquieting experience given that was also how she opened her assassinations.</p>
<p>Naturally, law-enforcement types like Sir Elliot of Kness were not welcome at Dutch's establishment.</p>
