<p>Namirrha was a necromancer and a member of the Cult of the Dragon during the mid–14 th century DR . He acted as the representative and negotiator for Malygris , the Blue Suzerain following his transformation to lichdom .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was an older man, with wrinkled skin and balding hair.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Namirrha wore an amulet of draconic might , which granted him direct control over Malygris.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>While Namirrha spent years courting Malygris for membership into the cult's ranks, in the end he treated the powerful undead dragon as little more than an oversized undead minion.</p>
<p>He and his fellow Dragon Cult members held enmity towards the Zhentarim and desired that they be driven from the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , Namirrha appeared before Malygris and appeased him with a collection of sapphires and new spells with which the old blue dragon was not familiar. They formed a bargain that Malygris would assail any caravan that did not pay the cult's tolls for crossing their territory in the desert.</p>
<p>After a terrible battle with the dragon Sussethilasis in the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , Malygris finally agreed to receive the "Mightiest of Treasures"—that is transformation into a dracolich—from Namirrha and his fellow cultists. With the aid of Namirrha and the cult, Malygris emerged as the ruler of much of Anauroch's blue dragons over the course of the next five years.</p>
<p>Later in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Namirrha ordered Malygris and his mate Verianthraxa to assault the Citadel of the Raven in response to Zhentarim raids on the cult's holdings in Sembia . The ill-conceived raid was a failure. While Malygris survived and returned to Anauroch, the recently-transformed Verianthraxa was destroyed. Malygris was not the same after the death of his queen.</p>
<p>On Mirtul 9 in the 1372 DR , Malygris received a visit at his mountaintop lair from Brennus and Clariburnus Tanthul of Thultanthar . Namirrha arrived shortly after the Princes of Shade , investigating reports of lightning bolts being discharged from up high. The two princes sought an alliance with the Blue Suzerain and made an initial offering to appease him. They killed Namirrha for insulting the mighty blue dracolich by presuming to control him with what they viewed as some mere trinket.</p>
