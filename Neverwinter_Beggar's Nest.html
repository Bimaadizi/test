<p>The Beggar's Nest was one of the districts of Neverwinter in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Beggar's Nest comprised the southeast quadrant of the city. It was named for the district's inhabitants, the poorest of Neverwinter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Plague</h3>
<p>During the city's struggle with the Wailing Death in 1372 DR , the Beggar's Nest was the most afflicted, as the plague first appeared there. The district was soon overrun by undead , as many of the inhabitants of the district died to the plague and a yuan-ti named Gulnan took advantage of the chaos to raise an army of undead. Eventually, the Hero of Neverwinter defeated the yuan-ti, disrupting her necromantic rituals and putting an end to the undead nightmare.</p>
<h3>Eruption</h3>
<p>When Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR , bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the Beggar's Nest was completely destroyed by the earthquakes that followed the cataclysm. A huge, canyon-like chasm replaced most of the district.</p>
