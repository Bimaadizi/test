<p>Halonya was the teenaged prophetess of Tchazzar and his high priestess. Although she was Tchazzar's proclaimed high priestess, she was incapable of casting divine magic.</p>
<p>Halonya was jealous of Jhesrhi Coldcreek and often whispered derogatory comments to Tchazzar behind Jhesrhi's back. After Tchazzar was slain during the Battle of Luthcheq , Halonya went to the building used as Tchazzar's temple and attempted to convince the priests to leave with her. Instead, the priests killed Halonya.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>Halonya was very thin and had an acne-scarred face. After her elevation to high priestess of the Cult of Tchazzar , she began wearing ridiculously elaborate red robes.</p>
