<p>The Lake of Salt , also known as Azulduth , was a shallow body of water in the Beastlands that was fed by the River of Swords . It was surrounded by partially-looted Sauroid ruins, many of which extended deep under the earth and was primarily inhabited by Yuan-ti .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ruined tower of the powerful wizard Nezram lay on the lake's far northeastern shore.</p>
<p>Deep beneath the lake was a large, complex system of pumps called the Pumps of Pyraddin , believed to be named for a dwarven engineer responsible for their construction. These pumps continually drained the welling springs around the lake and filtered their water through lakes of charcoal and chalk , as well as air jet bubble-rakes. Finally, it pumped the water down into the Deep Lands where it formed a river that eventually flowed up into the Aerilpar Forest .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The shallow waters of the lake was home to clans of sarrukh , wereserpents , and werecrocodiles .</p>
