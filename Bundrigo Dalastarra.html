<p>Bundrigo Dalastarra was a halfling man of the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast . In the mid–14th century DR , he held the civic official position of the Regent of City Works and the heraldic office of The Ravencoat , but proved rampantly corrupt.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Bundrigo was cheerful and good-natured, though also considered sly.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Bundrigo Dalastarra held the position of Regent of City Works in Ravens Bluff for a number of years. In that position, he operated a huge and well-oiled system of bribery, kickbacks, and informers, the greatest ever known in Ravens Bluff. He paid his hardworking officials well, though some believed the money ultimately came from pirates.</p>
<p>Bundrigo died during Ravens Bluff's war with Myrkyssa Jelan in the summer of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , though he was nowhere near the fighting. An unknown killer hacked him multiple times with a heavy bladed weapon, then left his body as a heap of smoldering ashes.</p>
<p>Scandal erupted as all Bundrigo's crimes were uncovered, with all his closest aides and associates implicated in his misdeeds. Lord Chancellor Arvin Kothonos had a difficult time finding anyone in the Regency with any experience who wasn't tainted by Bundrigo's web of corruption. Finally, Kothonos appointed the low-ranking but honest Lastraeya Indomurr as Acting Regent. She soon overhauled the Regency and left not even a whiff of corruption.</p>
