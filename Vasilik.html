<p>Vasilik was one of the Blades of the Old Man as of 1374 DR . He was tall, the only one who could look Sauk eye to eye, though he was not as robust otherwise. Pale and long-haired, he had a barbarian's look, but he had been just muscle for a guild from Waterdeep before Alaodin took him in. He took a vigil on the night of Tarsakh 19 on the orders of the Old Man of the Mountain at the Garden of Winged Horses in Sentinelspire . By the next day, his remains were found on the Star Fountain . Identification was not completely conclusive, but he wasn't seen again.</p>
