<p>Ukthet was a dragonborn member of the Inquest , and one of the elders that once ruled over the Abeiran city of Xorvintroth . After their deaths, their consciousnesses were preserved by magical means, while aspects of their personas lingered in the Astral Plane as a spectral echoes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Like their fellow elders, Ukthet wore a set of robes with astral and arcane imagery embroidered upon it along with a large metallic medallion set upon a necklace.</p>
<p>While in the Astral Plane, Ukthet and the other Inquest elders wore crowns of viridian crystals that protected them from detection from astral dreadnoughts .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in life, Uthket died and their consciousness was transferred to a brain in a jar . While researching the forces of the Far Realm , the consciousnesses of the Inquest elders became trapped in the Astral Plane. The dragonborn arranged for their dead bodies and still-living brains to be transported elsewhere in their city.</p>
<p>After some time the entity known as the Emissary of the Nine Eyes , showed them a green planet that would be an ideal new home for their people. The Inquest set to work on the bridge of stars , a means by which they could travel to that planet and be free from constant warfare.</p>
<p>Their work would remain incomplete however. Some time during or around the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the living brains of Ukthet, Lirith , and Krektesh were discovered within the remains of Xorvintroth. They were quite startled and bewildered after being stirred from such an prolonged stasis.</p>
