<p>Kachiko was a female warrior from the eastern lands of Kara-Tur who lived sometime before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little was recorded about eastern warrior named Kachiko. Despite her being a mystery, her sword, aptly named Kachiko's wakizashi ensured that at least the warrior's name was remembered. At some point after the weapon left her hands, the wakizashi traveled to the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale , and from there, was brought to the city of Athkatla in Amn in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR to be sold to some wealthy adventurers.</p>
