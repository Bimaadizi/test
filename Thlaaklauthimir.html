<p>Thlaaklauthimir , most commonly known as Freezefire , was an ancient white dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ancient white was at least several hundreds of years old, and prior to 1358 DR , had not been sighted for many centuries.</p>
<p>He was highly resistant to magic , and totally immune to cold, death magic , and all poisons . Thlaaklauthimir caused his foes to flee in fear.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Freezefire had a gargantuan hoard of treasure, almost filling his entire lair. Piles of gold, gems, and trinkets littered his home. The ancient white was also in possession of a huge, multifaceted gem imbued with powerful magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , the Heroes of Ascore ascended the Ice Peak . Almost immediately, their eyes were drawn to the iridescent gem, which was in the grasp of Freezefire's claw. The dragon appeared dead, and the famed heroes reached out towards the gem, influenced by the ancient power of the sparkling stone. With the gem in hands, the heroes believed they had completed their task, but it was then that Thlaaklauthimir returned to life.</p>
<p>After a fierce battle, fending off both their enemies and the dragon, the heroes were victorious. Freezefire lay dead, and his great horde was distributed to those of the North .</p>
