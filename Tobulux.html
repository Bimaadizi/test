<p>Tobulux was an outcast beholder ranger and cavelord who roamed the Lowerdark of the Underdark with his partner, the illithid Ralayn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>For holding perverted philosophical views that ran counter to the common morality and ethics of beholder society—he was good —Tobulux was driven out of his community and persecuted by his kind. However, he escaped and found a friend: Ralayn, an illithid who'd been outcast for similar reasons. Working together, they learned to survive and even made something of a home in the Underdark, in the Lowerdark where few could harass them.</p>
<p>Even so, circa 1372 DR , the beholder Jessek made moves to hunt down and slay Tobulux for being an abomination (he had nothing against Ralayn except that the illithid was in the way). However, Jessek first sought to capture an annihilator for the task.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>This odd couple lived and traveled together in a rare and unusual partnership.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tobulux and Ralayn survived as best they could together, for they had enemies everywhere and only each other as friends. They faced persecution and shunning from their own kinds; fear and disgust from other subterranean societies; and being attacked on sight by scared surface-dwellers. They were forced to move often as other races and creatures of the Underdark migrated through where they dwelled, and they kept no more than they could carry.</p>
