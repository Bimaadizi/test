<p>Burgher Xarod was the original boss of the land that later became the Xiousing district in Marsember .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Xarod controlled some of the neighborhoods around Xiousing and when the Sea of Fallen Stars retreated, he assumed control of the newly exposed land. In 1419 DR , King Azoun V granted the Shou Duc-Sum Li regency over the Xiousing district, which infuriated Xarod. Even in his extreme old age, he plotted to regain the land he believed to be rightfully his.</p>
