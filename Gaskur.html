<p>Gaskur was a bodyguard and servant to Marlin Stormserpent in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was quite nondescript.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was not one to second-guess his master.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Gaskur was not known to own any property.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Gaskur did all that Marlin required of him, and being a bodyguard was only a small part of his service.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He worked for Marlin Stormserpent . He was no stranger to kicks from nobles who found him not obsequious enough. As far as Marlin knew, he had no kin nor family in Suzail , but actually he had nieces, and these nieces had cats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1479 DR , Gaskur had served Marlin Stormserpent for six or seven seasons.</p>
<p>Gaskur accompanied Marlin Stormserpent in his foray to Dragonskull Chamber of Castle Obarskyr , where he stayed out the door while Marlin experimented with the control of Blueflame ghosts using the Wyverntongue Chalice and Flying Blade . Later, he ushered in the lords Delasko Sornstern , Broryn Windstag , and Kathkote Dawntard when they were looking to see Marlin Stormserpent after their murder of the officer of the Crown, Delnor , while drunken in the Dragonriders Club . Gaskur was attending to Marlin right up until the moment where the latter was approached by the two Blueflame Ghosts, Relve Langral and Treth Halonter , after completing their appointed task: slaying Seszgar Huntcrown and fetching his head. Marlin resolved to tell Gaskur to clean up after them, and to rake the corpse's bones out of the furnace.</p>
<p>Unknwon to anyone, the evil archmage Manshoon had resolved to slay Gaskur for one of his intrigues: he was going to send Talane to murder him. Gaskur's body was brought to Marlin afterwards; according to the watch, he was murdered on a roof, and the word " talane " scrawled on that same roof with his blood before he was kicked onto the floor.</p>
