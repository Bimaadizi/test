<p>Garden was the seventh planet orbiting the sun of Realmspace . Rarely seen from Toril , it appeared like a tiny green sparkle. It was one of the Five Wanderers , the five superior planets of the Torilian solar system. According to the planetary scholars of Shou Lung , Garden was an example of a rare live world .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Garden was actually a cluster of earth bodies linked together by a plant of incredible size called Yggdrasil's Child . All asteroids shared the same atmosphere. At least some of these asteroids were large enough for towns and even small rivers. The distance between these asteroids varied, but most were sufficiently far apart to allow a careful spelljammer ship to pass between them.</p>
<p>It was not known whether Yggdrasil's Child was sentient or not. The plant was extraordinarily resilient and long-lived and followed Garden's seasons in its own cycle of growth. Its main trunk was formed by hundreds of smaller trunks woven together, each over 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter. It was so massive that it took a person walking around the trunk about 6 hours to complete a lap. Only the roots of the plant existed in the Prime Material plane . To observers, Garden appeared something like the roots of a young potato plant full of tubers, extracted from the soil.</p>
<p>Because of the strange shape of Garden, sunset and sunrise happened abruptly; dusk and dawn were almost instantaneous.</p>
<h3>Moons</h3>
<p>Garden was orbited by 12 small moons, each with unique characteristics.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Garden was inhabited by a pirate cove led by Orion of Calimshan , who took the pseudonym Clive the Fearsome after his predecessor retired. The group consisted of 100 pirates commanding 12 small spelljamming ships.</p>
<p>The Chainmen , a human group of slavers, supposedly had a base somewhere in Garden.</p>
