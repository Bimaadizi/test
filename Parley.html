<p>Parley was a young adventuring druid from Vaasa , active in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Parley was a quiet, polite, delicate, and pretty young elven lass. Despite being in Waterdeep , away from her forest home, Parley showed no discomfort common among other members of their profession.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Kythorn of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the City of Splendors became once again endangered by the drow menace from the Undermountain . The Masked Lords determined that the danger was coming from Undermountain , and Durnan , the proprietor of the Yawning Portal , put out a call for adventurers willing to traverse the mega-dungeon and route the evil within.</p>
<p>Parley was among the heroes who answered the call. She left her solitary forest life in Vaasa after meeting an adventuring fighter named Faragati . The half-elven adventurer came across meditating Parley by a secluded forest brook. She invited him to join. Afterward, Faragati shared his adverting story and told her about the wonders of the world. He persuaded Parley to travel to "civilized" lands. Parley decided to follow her dreams of grand adventures and hoped to have tales of her deeds retold by many. She was present at the Yawning Portal, sipping wine and mingling with fellow adventurers when the inn became flooded by drow assassins sent by "queen" Valsharess . The dark elves slaughtered many of the gathered adventurers, including Parley. Survivors chased the assassins down into the Undermountain, while those killed were resurrected by the city's clergy. Being brought back from the dead left Parley shaken and willing to give up her adventuring life.</p>
