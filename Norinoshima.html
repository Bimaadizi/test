<p>In Kozakuran Year 1421 (1347 DR) , Hojo Todahiro convened his fleet at Norinoshima, utilizing the island as a gathering point to regroup and reorganize his allied armies following a series of inconclusive land and sea skirmishes. However, before the combined forces could fully assemble for a decisive campaign, they were taken by surprise when Takenaka Sugawara led a fleet of ships and men against them.
