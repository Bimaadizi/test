<p>A rod of flailing was a magic item that could be used as a weapon in combat.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These items gave off a hint of alteration magic under scrutiny from a detect magic spell .</p>
<p>When the command word was uttered the rod would transform into an enchanted double-headed flail . The flail would be an appropriate size for the wielder's current surroundings. Each of the flail's heads could be used to attack a target at the same time, effectively doubling the amount of potential harm from an attack. The heads could be used twice on a single target, or once each for two targets standing side by side.</p>
<p>Regardless of if the item was in rod or flail form, the wielder could expend a single charge to make it more difficult for opponents to strike them in combat. This magical effect lasted for ten minutes once activated.</p>
