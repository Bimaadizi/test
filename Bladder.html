<p>Bladders were animal bladders that could be inflated to be enjoyed as children's toys, employed as bardic props, or used as spell components .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While they could vary in size, the most popular bladders for entertainment purposes were from pigs , and could be inflated to the size of a human head. Bladders could be inflated with air or water. With air, they could be tied to a string, released to splutteringly fly around, or popped to produce a loud noise. With water, there was little more that could be done save for throwing them, although children could reliably devise more mischievous uses.</p>
<p>Bladders were useful for causing diversions or distractions.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , bladders were sold as bardic equipment from Aurora's Emporium , where they cost 1 gold piece per five pig bladders. The Emporium also carried smaller animal bladders for 5 copper pieces apiece, which were sold as material components for priest spells such as deep breath or steal breath . Around the same time, inflated odd-sound-making goat bladders were available for same from a magical curio shop called The Tricky Thief in the hamlet of Skull Crag in Cormyr .</p>
