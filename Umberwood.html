<p>The ' Umberwood' was a forest nestled at the eastern base of the Glittering Spires in the northern Hordelands .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Umberwood lay protected from the frozen winds blowing off the Yal Tengri . It was watered by the snowmelt that ran eastwards from the mountains and was a dry forest, unlike the swampy Ama Basin . The rivers quickly faded into the steppe, making the woods a narrow band between mountain and steppe.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The Umberwood covered the lower slopes of the mountainside, occupying deep-sided valleys. The rivers rushed down, cutting sharp narrow valleys into the land, separating the rivers themselves with knifelike ridges.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>Birch , elm , and larch were abundant, and their trunks were often covered in fungi and mosses . Brush, willows , and berry bushes stood in thick patches wherever an opening was made in the dense woods.</p>
<p>Monstrous centipedes , huge spiders , giant vultures , and ki-rin were to be found roaming the forest.</p>
<p>Small tribes of bakemono and hobgoblins lived in the Umberwood, fighting amongst themselves for food and land while raiding out into the steppes.</p>
<p>Yu lungs could be found in the rivers and lakes of the forest, while chiang lungs were a rarer inhabitant of the Umberwood.</p>
<p>During winter season, earth kala and yuki-on-na were to be found in the forest, disappearing as spring came to the land.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Delmyr , a remote and little-known kingdom of hin , lay in the Umberwood and on the eastern slopes of the Glittering Spires.</p>
