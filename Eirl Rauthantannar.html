<p>Eirl Rauthantannar , known as The Whisperer in Shadows and Old Eirl , was the Magister from 249 DR to 256 DR . He eventually became Greentree Haven .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>His nickname came from his hoarse voice. It thinned as he aged; by the end, he sounded like he was always whispering.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a kindly, wary man, slow and careful. He dreamed of a day when there would be too many mages for any one wizard or ruler to mistreat or dominate all of them. Eventually, the death of many wizards that he aided began to weigh on him; by the end of his life, melancholic sadness was taking the last of his energy.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Before becoming the Magister, Eirl had made a career of hiding in shadows and adopting demeaning disguises. After becoming the Magister, Eirl saw to the growth of mages everywhere, giving lore without thought to personal reward for the first time in the history of Magisters since Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler . He gave magelings a slow progression of spells as they advanced in the art. He also steered them into lives of study, safety, and low profiles.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At one point before becoming the Magister, Eirl Rauthantannar had spent the better part of a month pretending to be a dung carter in Zazesspur .</p>
<p>He slew a wizard who had polymorphed himself into a lizard man at the Magefair where Talana Brakuularn was killed, thereby becoming the Magister. He was not a young man upon assuming the office; as Magister, he gave magic to many students of magic. He would often loom out of the darkness and delivered a word of advice or a short sentence, gaining eventually the nickname of "whisperer".</p>
<p>As he aged, he grew wracked with diseases; eventually, he decided to give up life as a man and become Greentree Haven .</p>
