<p>Dredging claw was an enchanted halberd from the city of Targos in Icewind Dale .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dredging claw's design was a clue of its previous use. The halberd's shaft had a solid iron core, and despite it, it was significantly more lightweight than other similar weapons. The hook at the top of the halberd's head was used to latch onto ships and keep them close for boarding. Dredging claw showed little wear and tear from being used as a weapon. Despite its naval use, the halberd was perfect for skewering goblins from a distance.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The weapons possessed a simple +1 enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , dredging claw could be found among weapons sold by Deirdre Gallaway in the Gallaway Trade Depot in Targos.</p>
