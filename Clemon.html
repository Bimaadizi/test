<p>Clemon was a relatively prosperous sheep herder in the village of Volkumburgh in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , his sheep herd was hit three times within two weeks by the gargoyle minions of Flashfire , which he referred to as "demons," who would carry of his sheep to their master. Despite the fact that the village's tribute to the red dragon had already been made.</p>
<p>Around that time a group of adventurers from Suzail , seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas , overheard residents gossiping about this incident while in the Crimson Wyrm . With the gossip noting that recently those "demons" had grabbed two of his sheep and flew south with them. The adventurers came to Clemon's aid, fighting off the gargoyles the next time they attacked.</p>
