<p>Pagis Rhee was a member of the Harpers and the High Harper of the Cloakwood Chapter in the Cloakwood on the Sword Coast in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Pagis Rhee was well acquainted with the High Harper of the nearby Baldur's Gate chapter, Jaheira , as well as her wards. When Jaheira, alongside a group of Harpers, took off to the dreaded Shadow-cursed Lands , aiming to stop the recently returned enemy General Ketheric Thorm , the entire group seemingly disappeared without a word. Rion , Jaheira's older high half-elven adoptive daughter, reached out to Pagis Rhee seeking an update or a comforting word. The High Harper of Cloakwood Chapter expressed utmost confidence in Jaheira and comforted Rion, saying her mother would be fine.</p>
