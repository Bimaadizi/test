<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Palace of Loss was a tower with neither windows nor doors. Only Shar's petitioners and servants knew the way to enter or exit the tower.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>When the Great Wheel cosmology was the dominant view of the planes, the Palace of Loss was located in Niflheim , the second layer of Hades , before it was relocated in the Plane of Shadow of the World Tree cosmology .</p>
<p>After the Spellplague, the Palace of Loss was destroyed, leaving behind a gaping dark hole, much like an inverted tower, called the Foundation of Loss . The hole formed a magical portal to her new home in the Towers of Night in the Astral Sea . The Foundation was surrounded by a sense of sorrow so strong it could be felt, and the area attracted many evil beings of darkness from the Shadowfell .</p>
