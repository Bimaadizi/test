<p>A sacaanti was a type of creature that came about as a result of magical creation. It quite quite similar to an imp or a quasit , appearing as an amalgamation of the two. They were made by wizards of the Zhentarim to be utilized as familiars .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sacaanti very much resembled small fiends . They had leathery, bat -like wings and their body was noticeably tailless.</p>
<p>Unlike either of their progenitor species, Sacaanti were entirely devoted to their master-creators. Each pair of master and familiar enjoyed a strong telepathic link and emotional bond with one another. If either of them were to die, the other would be devastated.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They possessed a number of innate powers such as regeneration , the ability to "become ethereal" whenever they chose, as well as the capability to perform spellcasting.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Sacaanti most readily attacked others using their claws or venomous bite. While they were known to cast spells in battle, Sacaanti possessed a unique characteristic: their masters could cast spells through them, using their senses and position.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>In order to create a sacaanti, a mage needed to gather both an imp and a quasit in the same room. Several spells were involved in the creature's formation, including two castings of polymorph and a specifically-worded version of the wish spell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first specimens were created in Zhentarim laboratories some time during the 13 th century DR .</p>
