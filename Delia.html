<p>Delia was a Netherese enclave ruled by Lady Polaris .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Originally, Delia was an island crafted carefully by druids and was altered once it became an enclave under the care of Lady Polaris. Its treetop city architecture was soon expanded by more conventional means to support the wide array of magical research and city services that Lady Polaris demanded.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Lady Polaris later became tired of managing the city and turned it over to two of her students, Candlemas and Sysquemalyn during the Age of Discovery .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city of Delia was elevated in 2458 NY (−1401 DR) by Lady Polaris.</p>
<p>Delia was the only known Netherese enclave known for druidic and elven ways, though it soon became like the other enclaves. This caused the druids and elves who founded the city to leave for more ground-based surroundings.</p>
