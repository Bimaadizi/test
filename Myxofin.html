In preparation for his retirement, and trying to cover his success, in 1479 DR he had sent his agents to negotiate with the ambassadors of Aglarond , Chessenta , High Imaskar , and Netheril , in the hopes of buying some real estate in one of these countries and to go live there after retirement.</p>
