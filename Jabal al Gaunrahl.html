<p>Jabal al Gaunrahl was a jewel thief in Calimport and a member of the Knights of the Shield in 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jabal was the son of an elven slave and a struggling gem cutter in the Mj√¥m Sabban of the Jewel Ward of Calimport. His mother died in childbirth, and Jabal lived with his father until he was killed during the Darkstalker Wars . Jabal lived as a pickpocket for many years until he found a job as a guard in the Four Bezels , the Guildhall of the Society of Diligent Gemcutters , but he earned the ire of a pasha , who falsely accused him of thievery and sold him into slavery. Jabal, however, was rescued by the Knights, who had been fellows of his father, and they gave to him his father's holdings and his position in the Knights. Afterward, he became a nearly unstoppable gem thief for the Knights. Jabal gained his namesake from the theft of a priceless double-star sapphire intended for the syl-pasha . The Shadow Thieves even offered him a place among their number after this exploit.</p>
