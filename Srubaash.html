<p>King Srubaash was the goblin ruler of the Neidlig tribe in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Srubaash led his tribe with cunning and diplomacy, forming alliances with other communities and avoiding warfare whenever possible. His ultimate intent was to build a realm similar to Hlundadim , unifying goblins, orcs , and other humanoids . Thanks to his successes and belief in his grand destiny, he styled himself King, rather than Chieftain of his tribe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Srubaash claimed to have been visited by a mysterious spirit that urged him to rebuild the ancient realm of Hlundadim. Following this experience, he began assembling an increasingly expansive multi-racial realm, making Neidlig the largest and most powerful force in the Goblin Marches by the 1360s DR.</p>
