<p>Kurth Tower was a fortified castle that served as the headquarters of the High Captain of Ship Kurth in Luskan .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower dominated Closeguard Island in the mouth of the River Mirar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>It was a large building with a grand fa√ßade. The structure comprised a squat, thick-walled keep and a tall command tower that afforded a view of incoming ships .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The fortress was one of the most secure locations in Luskan, and served as the residence for the High Captain of Ship Kurth. The second-highest level of the tower was a large, circular room that served as the captain's bedchamber. Visitors were entertained in a room with an eastward-facing balcony that boasted an impressive view of Luskan and its docks.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Anyone who had no affiliation with either Ship Kurth or the Arcane Brotherhood was not even allowed on Closeguard Island, much less near Kurth Tower. As of the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , the tower was patrolled by two shifts of twenty guards each, all of whom were equipped with chainmail and armed with spears , broadswords , hand crossbows , and daggers . In addition, the tower had magical defenses installed during that time by Archmage Arcane Arklem Greeth , including protections against most forms of magical intrusion (although it did not stop the powers of psionicists ).</p>
<p>The door to the High Captain's bedchamber was locked and trapped. It required three separate keys to open safely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , a group of pirates attempted to deliver the Sword of Icewind Dale to High Captain Kurth, but they were intercepted at Kurth Tower by the Heroes of Ascore .</p>
<p>In the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Kurth Tower was assailed by a horde of gnolls as part of House Margaster 's invasion of Luskan.</p>
