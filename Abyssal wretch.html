<p>Abyssal wretches were a type of fiend created by mutating a humanoid.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The body of an abyssal wretch was a disfigured version of its original body.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Abyssal wretches attacked a target with whatever weapon they could wield.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Abyssal wretches were immune to all types of poison . They were also hardened against cold-, fire-, or lightning-based attacks. An abyssal wretch could not be charmed or frightened .</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Abyssal wretches were the unfortunate humanoid victims of rutterkins and sibriex . A humanoid bitten by a rutterkin slowly succumbed to a terrible disease, poisoning the victim with the corruption of the Abyss. If left untreated, the victim died and was then transformed into an abyssal wretch.</p>
<p>A sibriex transformed a humanoid into an abyssal wretch in a similar fashion. Instead of physical contact, a sibriex was capable of poisoning a target from up to 120 feet (37 meters) away. When the target died of the vile disease, they were transformed into an abyssal wretch, under the control of the sibriex.</p>
<p>The only way to reverse the transformation was via a wish spell.</p>
