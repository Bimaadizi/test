<p>Beorunna's Well was a large settlement of the barbarians of the Black Lion Tribe .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Members of the tribe lived in modest houses around the deep pit that once contained the ancestral mound. At the bottom of the pit dwelt Underdark monsters that the barbarians feared.</p>
<p>The Black Lion tribe forsook their nomadic habits and settled in a small, roughly built town surrounded by a stockade, where they traded timber, furs, and smoked meat. The Red Tigers held a different opinion about living like the southern folk and often resolved their disputes in duels to the death. Traders and merchants were welcome, though the journey there was full of dangers.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The town often traded with the dwarves of Citadel Felbarr , to whom they were connected by a trade route.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the time of High Netheril the Bey led refugees west from the failing city of Runlatha in the Netheril (region) but was hunted by three former prisoners of the city; Zukothoth a Nalfeshnee , the rakshasa Ickshar, and the mind flayer X’ss’a of Ellyn’taal. In the battle that followed the Bey collapsed a cavern, sending Zukothoth back to the abyss and trapping the other two deep beneath the well with a horde of Netherese treasures.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR , the Uthgardt tribes of Black Lion and Red Tiger both considered Beorunna's Well their ancestral mound.</p>
<h3>Legends and Rumors</h3>
<p>Legend says that Beorunna , the father of Uthgar , defeated the demon Zukothoth at the ancestral mound, causing it to sink into the earth.</p>
