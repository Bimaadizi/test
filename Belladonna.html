<p>Belladonna , also known as wolfsbane , monkshood , or deadly nightshade , was a type of poisonous herb found in the Realms that was related to horseradish .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Being a type of flowering plant, belladonnas produced delicate purple bell-shaped flowers and black glossy berries. Its leaves and roots contained substance called atropine . If one were to cast speak with plants on some belladonnas, the plants would typically speak to the caster about lycanthropy and werewolves .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Belladonna were most famous for their ability to cure lycanthropy. However, they were also toxic - anyone eating them was likely to find themselves weakened physically. Consumption of their flowers was capable of inducing state of death-like sleep. Some claimed even the plant's touch was toxic and required protective gloves to harvest.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Belladonna was known to grow in parts of the High Forest , in Bloodbark Grove in the High Moor , as well as on the small Isle of Balduran , in the Trackless Sea</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , belladonna could be found in both the Feywild and parts of the Domains of Dread .</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>If a victim bitten by a lycanthrope ate a sprig of belladonna within an hour of the bite, they had a chance of not contracting the disease. The belladonna, however, had to be relatively fresh, not picked any later than a week ago. Though consumption of belladonna worked equally as well for giants and giant-kin infected with lycanthropy, they needed to consume much larger amounts than the smaller humanoid races. Beyond its use with lycanthropy, it could be used to make a sedative.</p>
<h3>Magic</h3>
<p>Belladonna was used as a material component for a variety of charms, potions , spells , and obscure necromantic rituals. Because of this they were frequently harvested by hags and witches .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , during a full moon Ryld Argith consumed a belladonna and its three leaves from a branch he received from Yarno's grandfather after the former boy bit the drow on the wrist in his werewolf state that same evening. Belladonna prevented his first lycanthropic transformation.</p>
