<p>Holdensword was a hamlet in Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Fairly isolated, Holdensword was located on the southeastern edge of Turmish, between Gildenglade and Jathrin's Jump .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hamlet sprung up around the namesake stronghold known as The Hold of the Sword . This was the base of a mercenary company, The Riders of the Sword , who were active in the earliest days of human settlement on the northern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
<p>By 1370 DR , however, the Riders were long gone and the place was but a humble farming community.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The people here were cattle ranchers who kept their herds in the rolling uplands to the east and the south. They were known to be a stern and hardworking folk.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The old stronghold stood on a spur of rock in the southeast of the hamlet. Built of stone with massive walls and well fortified, it was a castle said to be as big and as imposing as anything found in Thay or Chessenta . Within the outcrop beneath it was a web of tunnels used for granaries and burial catacombs, and in former times as a long defensive gauntlet for defenders to retreat through.</p>
<p>Somewhere within either the castle or the tunnels were a series of secret rooms that were the quarters and workplace of the wizard Olonther , a high-ranking member of The Riders of the Sword. He built dozens of battle horrors to defend the castle.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It was thought possible that some of Olonther's battle horrors remained hidden within the castle or the tunnels, waiting to be reactivated. Furthermore, it was speculated that Olonther's spellbooks , magic items , and treasure might be with them too, and even the old mage himself in some state.</p>
