<p>Songfarla was an ancient and hidden rock gnome realm located in the eastern spur of the Sunrise Mountains .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Songfarla was located in the eastern Sunrise Mountains at the source of the most northwestern tributary of the River Murghol , which was approximately equidistant from the ruins of Delhumide and the Lake of Mists .</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>To maintain their hidden existence, the gnomes of Songfarla traded their goods quietly, utilizing merchants who claimed no affiliation with any realm. These merchants operated in Almorel , Murghyr , and Duirtanal for things that the gnomes could not make themselves—they were otherwise completely self-sufficient.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Songfarla's greatest defense was its anonymity. Not even the Thayan Zulkir of Divination knew of its existence. Practically all passages into and around Songfarla were hidden by powerful illusion magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>A settlement in the Sunrise Mountains was founded by escaped slaves from Netheril . In −3149 DR , it became the kingdom of Songfarla when its population exploded with an influx of more refugees.</p>
<p>The kingdom was later caught up in the wars between Raumathar and Narfell , when conjured demons attacked in −555 DR . Afterwards, the gnomes cloaked their realm in illusions to avoid future detection and attack.</p>
<p>In the Year of Imparted Riches, −469 DR , the population of Songfarla was dwindling until four svirfneblin clans migrated there, the Covarrkar , Fungusfoot , Glasszhorm , and Longstepper clans.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Gnomish tales tell of the purchase of Songfarla's lands for a massive piece of fool's gold, though whom the lands were bought from and even if it was fool's gold that was used (another common tale says gilded granite ) could change with the teller.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The Gilded Nugget was a vast cavern within the mountains located in the thickest part of a massive gold vein that was somehow naturally studded with gemstones. The Nugget was a center of both government and worship (it was considered one of Garl Glittergold 's greatest temples) as well as a community hub for other activities, including commerce and the arts.</p>
