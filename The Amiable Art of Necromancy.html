<p>The Amiable Art of Necromancy was a book dedicated to the arcane arts of necromancy and their practical usages, penned by Cherish Hollow sometime in or before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The book's author recorded her musings and views on the art of necromancy and her attitudes toward outer people's opinions on the subject. Even though many frowned on necromancy, Cherish Hollow claimed that it was a "social magic." She then continued making that point by walking about her zombie servant – the creature that once was Nascent Owens . Cherish stated that the zombie remembered naught of its former life and that it found pleasure in serving his mistress tea , performing foul-smelling yet relaxing backrubs, or attacking her enemies and consuming their brains. Cherish stated that the discarded body – a husk, was given direction and purpose in the most economic sense as well as in the metaphysical sense. The author concluded by stating that necromancy was is useful to those who sought to challenge the cultural notions of death and to those who were lonely.</p>
