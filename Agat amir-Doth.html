<h2>Personality</h2>

One of Agat's favorite forms of entertainment was eliminating an attractive female target's family members one at a time until she had no other option but to join the harim . Because of this veils were used more often in Jumlat in an attempt to mask beauty from Agat's predatory eyes.</p>
