<p>Frothwater was an ancient Netherese city during the time of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city was built at the confluence of the upper Hungry River , near the Desertsmouth Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Frothwater was founded in 2714 NY (−1145 DR) by Samual Frothwater , a ranger who led a group of homesteaders and ranchers away from the settled lands of Netheril. The settlers wished to escape the decadence and tyranny of archwizards who ruled Netheril, and built a fairer society on their own terms. With this as a goal, they managed to build a city that had good governance and fair taxation.</p>
<p>The city came under the gaze of the red dragon Embercoat in 2714 NY (−1145 DR) . Without the aid of the powerful arcanists of Netheril, the Frothwater fended for itself for twenty years as the dragon raided it twice a season. The dragon was tracked down and attacked by adventurers in 2734 NY (−1125 DR) , who managed to greatly wound her at the cost of their own lives. The sole survivor Reliaz Justmarch prepared for the dragon to return, and slew her the next year when Embercoat attacked in the spring.</p>
<p>The city survived Karsus's Folly , but the expansion of the Anauroch caused its eventual abandonment in 3650 NY (−209 DR) , and the refugees joined with the three Lost Kingdoms .</p>
