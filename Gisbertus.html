<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Hammer of 1370 DR , master chef Thundaerl returned to Tethyr and offered his services to the queen. This caused a conflict with Gisbertus, who did not want to give up his kitchens. In the end, Thundaerl became the chef of the Great Hall while Gisbertus remained the head chef for the palace of Faerntarn itself.</p>
