<p>The Fundamental Planes were infinite planes of existence which existed above and below the Prime Material Plane . The Astral Sea was considered a realm of spirituality, pure thought and ethos. The Elemental Chaos was the domain of raw elemental matter and energy. These planes were levels of reality in which countless specific locales existed like finite islands adrift in the infiniteâ€”the various Astral dominions and Elemental realms .</p>
<p>The fundamental planes were not simply other planes, but dimensions formed and governed by spiritual concepts and elemental principles alien to the concepts of the Prime.</p>
<p>Although the fundamental planes were infinite, the known astral dominions and elemental realms to scholars of Toril lay within a finite distance of each other. If a traveler was to journey through a fundamental plane into the trackless reaches outside the known dominions and realms, sooner or later he or she would arrive to divine dominions or elemental kingdoms of different universes. Such a journey would by unthinkably long, however.</p>
