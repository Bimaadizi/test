<p>A madcap was a redcap that soaked its hat in demon ichor rather than the customary blood. These fey exhibited a more extreme version of their more common counterparts' temperament.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Rather than falling unconscious, when a madcap was damaged to the point of no longer being able to fight, it died in a burst of fire that rendered all but its boots and weapon into ash.</p>
<h2>Notable Madcaps</h2>
<p>The Knucklebones Gang , an Avernian gang led by Mad Maggie , counted 30 madcaps among its members.</p>
