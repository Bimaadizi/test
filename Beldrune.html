<h2>History</h2>
<p>Beldrune had once acted in a performance of "The Stormy Knight", where he played the Second Undergardener. According to Tabarast, he'd probably never been on an adventure, though Tabarast had known adventure. The two of them had been to Ripplestones at some point prior to 767 DR .</p>
<p>As of the Year of Laughter, 761 DR , Beldrune and Tabarast had been in Moonshorn Tower for some time, studying the texts there. They had agreed not to broach the subject of Chosen of Mystra , but did so anyway, speculating idly as to the signs claimed by the priests of Mystra's Mantle in Haramettur that Elminster Aumar was once again walking the lands. They had been at this task for years.</p>
<p>By the spring of that year, Tabarast and Beldrune noticed a stranger walking into Moonshorn; unknown to them, this was the Elminster they'd heard about. Though they turned away from the stranger until he left, there were burning letters left in the documents he read; they took those as a sign of Mystra 's direct intervention, and decided to pursue Elminster, and be witnesses in his wake. They rode after him on mules . On the way, they were soon passed by Ilbryn Starym , who was also in pursuit of Elminster.</p>
<p>They reached the Castle of the Lady , where Elminster Aumar apprenticed under the sorceress Dasumia at some point before the Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , by which point they were already observing the comings and goings of the two mages from one or more hidden positions near the castle. They continued to spy on the castle until Beldrune scried on Nethra , guided by a dream that he considered an omen of Mystra, learning of the coronation of Dasumia and Elminster's new position as the Court Mage almost as soon as that event happened. Before they left, they clashed with Ilbryn Starym and Tabarast humbled him in spell-battle, but they did share with him the whereabouts of Elminster. They remained in Nethra afterwards; during the last day that Dasumia and Elminster remained in town, they were at the Goblet of Shadows , a local tavern. They drank a lot there.</p>
<p>By 767 DR , they had abandoned their Elminster search, and had settled somewhere near Starmantle . There, one day, Tabarast came across a rejuvenation spell in an empty page of his spellbook ; Beldrune attested to feeling rejuvenated by it. The two of them had been teachers, for quite some time at that point, until they were commissioned by a Harper , secretly the god Azuth , to hunt after Elminster, whom he was seeking.</p>
<p>They made a short stop for food at the Fair Maid , a tavern in Ripplestones , town where they nearly rode down Baerdagh , a local elderly man, and then were joined by Caladaster Daermree , another local elderly man and former wizard, who agreed to guide them to nearby ruins where he was almost certain Elminster would turn up. The man led them to Karsus' Keep , where they came across Elminster just as the Slayer, the ghost of the Netherese sorceress Saeraede Lyonora , was beginning to feed on him. The Harper revealed himself to be Azuth, and hurled deadly spells at Elminster in an effort to dislodge Saeraede from him. Just as Azuth warned him that if she stayed on him, he'd be doomed, five Dreadspells of Shar blasted the chamber with a cavalcade of deadly staves from a hole in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Azuth protected the three wizards from the destruction that ensued. Then, upon the death of Saeraede, who was struck down by Ilbryn Starym after he had burst from hiding to attack, Azuth held back the explosion that resulted from Saeraede's death throes. Azuth then vanished together with Elminster, leaving the three mages awed and briefly bewildered. They rambled shortly, and then found among the rubble three gowns that Saeraede had stolen previously.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they headed for the Fair Maid, where they had some drinks, showed around the dresses, and talked about their latest adventure. Beldrune embellished heavily, claiming that it was their spells that had saved the day and that Azuth had told them so. Tabarast added that Azuth had told them they'd earned the magical robes they were showing off, though Azuth had said nothing of the sort. Sharindala , a local undead sorceress, later joined them at the tavern briefly, before departing with Caladaster, but said everything they'd said about Azuth was true.</p>
