<p>The Upstream Span was a bridge across the River Mirar in the city of Luskan .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Of the three bridges that crossed the River Mirar within Luskan (the other two being Dalath's Span and the Harbor Cross ), the Upstream Span was—appropriately—the furthest upstream and therefore the northernmost. At its north end was the North Gate —the northern entrance to the walled city—thus the bridge provided quick access from the city's South Bank directly to this gate. Baliver's House of Horses was situated at the south end of this bridge.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the Spellplague in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , the Upstream Span was nearly destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river. In the decades that followed, local gangs would occasionally try to make repairs to the bridge—sometimes by simply fashioning a makeshift crossing out of ropes —in hopes of charging tolls. The bridge remained impassable through the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , but was usable by the Year of the Tasked Weasel, 1483 DR , albeit crumbing, treacherous, and controlled by Ship Rethnor , who demanded tolls for its use. By the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the Upstream Span had been fully restored.</p>
