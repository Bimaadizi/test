<p>The Crowns of Whispers , also known as the bridal crowns of Aliia , were a pair of matching, enchanted circlets that imbued the wearer with greater charisma.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Each circlet was made of gold and was decorated with three star rubies on the front. Three points adorned the top, one raising above each of the wearer's temples and the third raising from the center of the forehead. They were said to look magnificent.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone who wore a Crown of Whispers instantly became a better negotiator, both becoming more diplomatic and better able to intuit the concerns and thoughts of others. Additionally, once per day the wearer was able to further enhance their powers of persuasion or any magic intended to charm someone.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The matching Crowns were crafted in the Year of the Fearless Peasant, 926 DR for the coronation of Princess Aliia of Impiltur . One was for her while its twin was for her fiancée and consort, Prince Rhiigard Obarskyr of Cormyr . The union would cement a powerful bond between Impiltur and Cormyr, and the Crowns were crafted to signify the dual role that the two kingdoms would have in each others' rule.</p>
<p>However, the Crowns were lost beneath the Inner Sea when the ship transporting them to the wedding, Nadyra's Glory , sank mysteriously about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off-course. Also lost in the shipwreck was Aliia's life as well as two other storied magic items : the Greatsword of Impiltur and Kimeltaar , the "Demonsbane Shield".</p>
<p>By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , both Crowns along with the Greatsword of Impiltur had been recovered from the wreck by the succubus demon lord Soneillon , the so-called "Queen of Whispers", who kept them in the Giantspire Mountains . It was under her ownership that the two crowns came to be known as the Crowns of Whispers .</p>
<p>When the Spellplague struck in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR , Soneillon was torn away from Toril , leaving behind the Crowns and the Greatsword to be claimed by her former minions, the hobgoblins of the Giantspires. By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , one of the Crowns as well as the Greatsword had come into the possession of Maaqua , the queen of the Razor Heart tribe, while the other Crown was owned by Aruugan , the chief of the Black Wolf clan.</p>
