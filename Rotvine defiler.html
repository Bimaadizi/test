<p>A rotvine defiler was an abomination born from a divinity of fertility.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were described as a morass of tendrils, vines, rotting animals, and mud. In one particular case, a rotvine defiler resembled a treelike, ovoid creature made of indistinct flesh, with four flat legs and a single horn akin to that of a unicorn ; the horn measured 15 feet (4.6 meters), while the creature was twice that on a side.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Their intentions were generally limited to the destruction of all life.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The despoiled morass of a rotvine defiler caused an aura that extended to about 20 feet (6.1 meters) away; anyone standing within would be slowed by it. All their attacks caused bodily withering to any living creature they struck. They generally attacked with lashing tendrils, which made it nigh-impossible to move anywhere for those they managed to strike. Sometimes, their tendrils struck out with rot, becoming a hazard for anyone standing close; those who became restrained by the tentacles of rot were soon struck with earthly maws that continued to break down the bodies of those who had yet to free themselves.</p>
<p>In response to severe damage, rotvine defilers released an explosion of vile vapors that caused even more intense, deadly withering to anyone within 50 feet (15 meters). Those who actually managed to defeat the defiler would induce another such burst.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Rotvine defilers were sometimes accompanied by blood fiends , when they allowed other creatures to accompany them at all. They generally remained encysted until a sacrifice released their seals.</p>
<p>In one particular case, a rotvine defiler was bred by the Rotting Man , a Talonite patriarch of the Unapproachable East . The creature remained encysted until commanded to reveal itself by him in 1373 DR.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , the Rotting Man of Dun-Tharos attempted to strike down Araluen , an aspect of Lurue , with a creature born of the corrupted majority of her essence that he'd stolen a decade prior: a rotvine defiler named simply the Step-Daughter of Talona . Unfortunately for him, Araluen was able to assimilate this essence again and proceeded to run him out of his stronghold with it.</p>
