<p>Valem was a Talonite troll active in the Trollbark Forest during the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After losing his clan to tribal battles and sickness, and eating his own dead tribemates, Valem received a vision from Talona . She pretended that she was the one who gave trolls their strength, toughness and regenerative abilities, and announced that she had picked Valem as her speaker among the trolls—an unrefined lie, but good enough to fool a dumb troll anyway.</p>
<p>After having part of his mind awakened by the goddess and being taught her dogma, Valem roamed the Troll Hills and the Trollbark Forest, trying to convert existing tribes to his newfound faith. This endeavor turned out to be fruitless as most trolls didn't care about religion, and the few tribes containing an adept were reluctant to changing their chosen deity. Talona didn't care, though: in her eyes Valem was a simple experiment, and a clever way to annoy Vaprak .</p>
<p>Valem tried to spread diseases among the tribes he visited, with the hope that curing them afterwards would help bring them to his side. Unfortunately the wake of diseases following him convinced most tribes that he was bad luck.</p>
<p>During the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Valem crossed the path of a priest in possession of a copy of the " Treasure of the Golden Hills ", a gnomish holy book . He killed and ate the priest, and despite being unable to read he choose to keep the book as he liked its pretty pictures.</p>
