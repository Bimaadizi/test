<p>A Chijiriki ( pronounced : / tʃ i dʒ i r i k i / chee-jee-ree-kee ) was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A chijiriki was a standard spear between 7​ to ​10 feet (2.1​ to ​3 meters) in length that has been augmented with a length of weighted chain attached to its butt end. It offered the versatility of being used as a regular spear for thrusting and striking, while the weighted chain on the opposite end allowed for tripping attacks. By swinging the butt end, the weapon entangled an opponent, providing a means of immobilization or control during combat.</p>
