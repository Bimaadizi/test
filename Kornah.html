<p>Kornah "The Crazy" was a member of the Harpers who posed as a crazed guide of Zhentil Keep . She had a pet crow named Shalla with whom Kornah shared a weak mental-link.</p>
<h2>Home</h2>
<p>Kornah's house, in keeping with her disguise, is a disheveled mess. This is all for appearances, though, as it in actuality serves as a safehouse for any Harpers in the region. Shalla would mostly stay in the home and would warn Kornah of any intruders attempting to break in while she was out for the day. Her home was located near the center of the Foreign Quarter just off of Zhent Avenue .</p>
