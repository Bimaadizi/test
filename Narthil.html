<p>Narthil was a town near Athalantar in the Western Heartlands in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Narthil was outside Athalantar proper, save for a short period in the Year of Bloodflowers, 234 DR . There were grazing fields northeast, and past them, rolling hills. Past the hills, there was at least one river, almost certainly the Delimbiyr River .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The town's lord steward was Aunsiber .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>At that time, Narthil was equipped with a swing-gate and garrisoned by a number of armsmen of Athalantar, as the town had recently been seized as part of that kingdom. There was a keep in the city, Narthil Keep, but it was barely a stone pile with a gate of its own. In that year, Prince Gartos rode overnight from the east to reach Narthil, strongly implying that there was a fortress within a night's ride.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 234 DR, Narthil was briefly taken over by forces from Athalantar. Upon her arrival, the priestess Elmara, secretly Prince Elminster Aumar , was interrogated by guardsmen, whom she struck with an illusion that made them feel as though swords had been driven through their bellies. They fled, and she went to a local inn, Myrkiel's Rest , where she was in turn accosted by magelings. She slew one of them and the others fled; out in the streets, she drew the attention of the town's lord steward. Frightening him by pretending to cast a spell , Elmara staked a position and he fled east, looking for reinforcements.</p>
<p>These reinforcements arrived by next morning, consisting of sixty riders, Prince Gartos, and Magelord Eth Junster bolstering him; they'd come after learning that all of Seldinor Stormcloak 's apprentices had been slain at the Unicorn's Horn inn west of Narthil. She slew them the same, and then fled the town.</p>
