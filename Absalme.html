<p>Absalme was a henchman, or perhaps pet, to the Talontar blightlord Damanda in 1373 DR . She was 'elf thin', wore a gown of white leather, and played a flute of fused humanoid bones. After she tried to grab Araluen and lift the child by her hair, the infant brushed her wrist; she was instantly annihilated by blinding light.</p>
