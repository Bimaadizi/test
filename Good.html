<p>Good was the opposite of evil , and was generally associated with honesty, charity, and sincerity.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As with evil, good was subjective and was defined differently by different societies and inhabitants. However, generally, those who were good often worried about their errors and would try to repair damage, if they had caused any. Inhabitants who focused on the pursuit of good, especially helping others, with no particular regard for law or chaos were known as neutral good . Those who strived for the greater good, even if it meant being unorganized or radical, were known as chaotic good . Good inhabitants who swore by law and order, particularly paladins, were known as lawful good .</p>
<p>Some interpreted good inhabitants as those who practiced altruism, protection of life, and personal sacrifice. Others interpreted good people as those who believed that protecting and helping those in need, or those who are too weak to act for themselves, was the right thing to do.</p>
