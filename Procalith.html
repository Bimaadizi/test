<p>Procalith was a city in the Chultan Peninsula . It had become a ruin by the 14 th century DR . Technically it was still considered a part of Lapaliiya .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Procalith was founded in 16 DR . It was ruled through most of its duration by a succession of kings appointed by the Shoon Imperium or by the oligarchies of Tashalar .</p>
<p>In 293 DR , the princess Nasana Melnuthquel was offered the position of Magister by Azuth , and installed her lover a puppet ruler, leaving the city to carry out her Magisterial duties. She returned in 297 DR , having become an indiscriminate killer of mages; she slew her ruler's consort, Osalra , who was a mage of minor power, and died of heartstop on the spot. A courtier, Sabral Faryre , finished off her body and claimed the mantle of the Magister; he immediately slew the then-king, a number of other people at the court, and commanded he be brought a number of people of magical talent he knew of in the city. Once brought to him, they were named his Council of Lords and Ladies , which he meant to rule Procalith with. He was killed within seven days, with his body pierced by a harpoon that went straight through him and the throne too. Though one of his council, Lady Mimré , used a spell to burn his body, she was not awarded the mantle of the Magister; instead, she disappeared, as did the throne, which wouldn't be found until two decades later, discarded in an underground chamber of the palace.</p>
<p>The city was destroyed in 1142 DR , during the Rage of Wizards , by a sorcery-driven storm.</p>
