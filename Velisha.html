During that time, Velisha offered comfort to a disgraced murderous paladin of Lathander named Mantides . She was trying to convert the man to the worship of Shar, the Lady of Loss. She preyed on the man's sense of injustice and offered him a clean slate after all the acts of vengeance and murder he committed.
