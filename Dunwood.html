<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Settlement by Elves</h3>
<p>Clan Sethomiir dark elves constructed Narathmault in -10400 DR beneath what would become Dun-Tharos. Sun elves and moon elves from Shantel Othreier settled the forest as part of Lethyr in -9750 DR .</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Narfell</h3>
<p>In -1020 DR , raids by the Nars caused the elves of Lethyr to abandon the portion of the Riildath that became the Rawlinswood and an arm of the Great Glacier began separating it from the Forest of Lethyr. In -970 DR , the Nentyarch built Dun-Tharos near the Soleine River headwaters and began uniting the Nar kingdoms. The Great Conflagration between Narfell and Raumathar took place in the area from -160 DR to -150 DR . The Great Druid of Leth , claiming the title Nentyarch, raised a living tree-fortress over Dun-Tharos in 722 DR .</p>
<h3>Conflicts with Impiltur</h3>
<p>In 726 DR , demons of the Scaled Horde from the western Rawlinswood and Forest of Lethyr overran Impiltur. Impiltur slew and dispersed the western Rawlinswood's demon survivors of the Fiend Wars and the Battle of Moaning Gorge in the Scouring in 850 DR , driving the remainder to Narfell. Soneillon took refuge in abandoned gnome mining tunnels beneath the Rawlinswood circa 940 DR and began recruiting hobgoblins in the Giantspire Mountains who used the tunnels to attack Impiltur in 1095 DR .</p>
