<p>The bonethriven was a wind instrument that could be found in mind flayer communities.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The instrument consisted of a resonance chamber that was surrounded by an enormous assembly of tubes that were carved from the bones of thralls. It was played through an illithid blowing into the mouth piece while it used its tentacles and fingers in conjunction to open and close a dozen stops. A thrivenist that became skilled enough to master the instrument was able elicit sounds so horrible that non-illithids who heard the "music" were affected negatively by it until it stopped.</p>
<p>A bonethriven was regularly played at the Spinal Tap tavern in Oryndoll .</p>
