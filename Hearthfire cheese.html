<p>The so-called Hearthfire cheese , or simply Korontaun cheese , was a variety of cheese made with the milk of korontaun , or mountain korrun sheep native to the Giantspire , Icerim , and Sunrise Mountains , notably domesticated by the Nar humans .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hearthfire was a sharply-flavored cheese with a crumbly texture and a light amber color. It was often smoked alongside slabs of korontaun meat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the 15 th century DR , Korontaun cheese was produced everywhere these sheep were domesticated: Narfell , Rashemen , Thesk , and in recent years, the Great Dale and Murghôm . The smoked variety of that cheese reached Impiltur in the late 15 th century DR and quickly became a table staple in the areas where korontaun sheep were present.</p>
