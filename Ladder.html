<p>Ladders were handy (but bulky) tools that allowed people to climb up walls.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A ladder was basically two parallel wooden poles connected by a series of evenly-spaced rungs. It was used by leaning it against a wall, and once in place it allowed the user to reach the higher vantage point. A ladder could also be set horizontally across a gap, creating a simple bridge, though they did not bear the weight as easily then.</p>
<p>Exceptionally large ladders used for scaling castle walls were known as siege ladders . Though a simple and direct solution, siege ladders were highly dependent on the defenders being taken by surprise or otherwise distracted, often in conjunction with other siege engines .</p>
<p>Rope ladders were flexible and able to be bundled up, while spider poles were a collection of metal rods that could be assembled into a climbing frame. The ladder of Elminster was a performer's piece that could stand up without support.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of ladders for the discerning climber which could support 500 pounds (230 kilograms) vertically and 400 pounds (180 kilograms) horizontally. They were made of duskwood and came in 2‑foot (0.61‑meter) (7 sp ), 6‑foot (1.8‑meter) 3 gp , 10‑foot (3‑meter) (5 gp), and 20‑foot (6.1‑meter) (10 gp) lengths. For an addition gold piece, the 10" and 20" ladders could be fitted with hooks that allowed them to be connected to each other or hung from windows and roofs.</p>
<h2>Magic</h2>
<p>If one was unable to procure a ladder, then the ladder , smoke ladder , or force ladder spells would allow an ambitious spellcaster to imitate their power.</p>
