<p>Namji was a famous spell inventor and reckless battlemage from Thesk in Northeast Faerûn , active long before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Namji made his name by being an overhasty battle wizard who delighted in tossing destructive spells at his opponents. He also created a unique and powerful enchanted robe that offered little spell resistance but regenerated any battle damage Namji sustained. However, his most famous invention was Namji's burning hands , a more powerful adaptation of the regular burning hands spell .</p>
<p>The wizard's final fate remained unknown; however, Namji's robe was aboard an old shipwreck. It was found on the island of an undead white dragon Icasaracht , on Lac Dinneshere in Icewind Dale . The discovery took place in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
