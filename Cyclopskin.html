<p>A cyclopskin ( pronounced : /ˈ s aɪ k l oʊ p s k ɪ n / SY-klops-kin listen ) was a smaller version of a cyclops .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The typical cyclopskin stood around 7 feet and 5 inches (2.3 meters) and weighed around 350 lb (160 kg). These one-eyed monsters had poor depth perception. Cyclopskin of both sexes gradually lost their hair as they got older, generally becoming fully bald by the age of 25. It was also unheard of for cyclopskin to grow any sort of facial hair. When a cyclopskin had hair, it was generally seen in an unkempt state, long and shaggy, riddled with all manner of lice and fleas.</p>
<p>They typically dressed in dirty garments that were made of animal hide.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, most cyclopskin preferred to use bardiches , clubs , over-sized slings , and spears . The latter two were only used when needing to attack from afar or when out hunting. Because of their poor depth perceptions, cyclopskin were not good with did not use missile weapons. Thus, unlike other giant-kin , they were not skilled with throwing boulders.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>All cyclopskin believed they descended from the strong line of Annam , but most giants suspected these runts came from one of Othea 's affairs.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>

<p>Cyclopskin generally lived alone or traveled in small bands looking for prey and suitable captives.</p>
<h3>Lycanthropy</h3>
<p>Cyclopskin were known to be susceptible to all forms of lycanthropy and retained their distinctive single eye regardless of which form they took.</p>
