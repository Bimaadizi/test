<p>Fimbrul devils were soldiers of the Nine Hells that were said to sap the very life from the flesh of the living.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fimbrul devils resembled thin humanoids with blue skin and craggy, ice-like spikes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fimbrul devils spreads winter wherever they went, turning the air in the areas they occupied bitterly cold and dry and freezing water solid. They had a natural control over ice, resisted it (as well as fire) and could move on it without difficulty. It was said that a person who survived battling a fimbrul devil would feel chills for years.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In combat, fimbrul devils would attack with their claws and breathe out icy exhalations to slow down opponents, or otherwise freeze their enemies from afar. They remained on icy ground and generally avoided the biggest threats. They coordinated in battle to slow the enemy down as much as possible in hopes of immobilizing them and letting the cold air of their environment finish them off. Victims of their attacks could be found frozen solid and encased in a rime of blue ice.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Fimbrul devils were native to the Nine Hells , where they lived in the layers of Cania and Nessus .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late years of the 15 th century DR , the Ashmadai cells of Neverwinter were known to employ the services of fimbrul devils.</p>
<p>Just after the start of the War of the Silver Marches in 1484 DR , shortly after the city of Blingdenstone sent out the first shipments of its new trade treaty with Gracklstugh , a group of fimbrul devils caused the Darklake to freeze over, forcing Blingdenstone to shut down its harbor and causing the deaths of more than a few svirfneblin . A group of adventurers, guided by Harbormaster Ginnertow , would stumble upon the devils and put an end to their terror.</p>
