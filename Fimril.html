<p>Fimril of Westgate was a mageling of the Zhentarim in the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He had dark eyes and wore a black robe.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>To Sarhthor , like most magelings of the Zhentarim , Fimril was dark-hearted and ambitious. Though he bore a spark of self-doubt, he was brave, arrogant, and indeed ambitious, believing himself capable of rising to the top of the Zhentarim, and considering that people who talked back to him in a way he disapproved of could be done without.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fimril was able to use a slaying spell that consumed a crushed black pearl as its material component , almost certainly death spell . His version of the spell, however, was strong enough to kill him and his comrades too. He had also devised a unique spell that took him an entire year to construct, which created a moving barrier of all-devouring darkness, a spell powerful enough to counter spellfire .</p>
<p>Another strange power of Fimril was a very draining spell that called up images from the ashes of a fire, allowing a mage to see what had transcurred while it was burning.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He'd been either trained or tested by Sarhthor. Lyrkon , Glondar , and Duthspurn were both part of the squad to which he was assigned.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to 1357 DR , Fimril was Fimril of Westgate , strongly implying he'd spent a significant amount of time in that city. He'd spent at least one year, per his own recollection, developing a spell that created an all-devouring shield of darkness, capable of stopping most spells and disintegrating most material that it went through.</p>
<p>He was part of a meeting in late 1357 DR , in which Sarhthor offered several magelings of the Zhentarim the assignment to hunt down Shandril Shessair for her spellfire. He caught up with her at Hullack Forest , where he was able to magically examine a campfire and scry on what she'd done. During their confrontation, he used a novel spell that created an all-disintegrating screen of darkness; by moving it, he kept his forces protected from spellfire, and then used the screen to threaten Delg Hammerhand 's life, successfully getting Shandril to surrender.</p>
<p>Though he captured Shandril Shessair, he used a killing spell on Mirt when the latter turned up to rescue her; the spell was reflected, slaying him.</p>
