<p>Hardcheese was a prosperous halfling family from the city of Daggerford that operated the Happy Cow tavern and a dairy farm in the farmlands outside of the city, where they are producers of a quality sharpcrumble cheese and almond -flavored beer , in the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR, Fulbar Hardcheese was being paid close attention to by the Lords' Alliance , the Harpers , and the Zhentarim , despite him actively trying to keep a low profile and being a "quiet power" in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, a shape-changed bronze dragon named Zirazylym , or "Zira," became the tavern's patron. She grew quite fond of the Hardcheese clan but chose not to meddle in their affairs. However, she would protect the hin if they were to come to a direct conflict with the Zhentarim, the clan's main competitor in the moneylending business.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Apart from the land, farm, and the Happy Cow tavern, the Hardcheeses also owed a home in Daggerford. Fulbar Hardcheese's Residence was a building nestled between the Happy Cow and the home of Maelwyn , a baron's son. A little known fact was that Fulbar and the Hardcheeses owned a large number of properties in Neverwinter as well as Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fulbar Hardcheese was an adventuring hin thief , who retired to run the Happy Cow in Daggerford some years before the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR and was ashamed of his past. His favorite clients were farmers and Daggerford townsfolk. Fulbar's tavern was financed by a dragon 's hoard he scored in his adventuring days, which was buried underneath the tavern—a secret to all but the elders of the Hardcheese clan. Fulbar was the full owner and manager of the tavern. However, by the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Demetira Landscraper was hired as a manager and a bookkeeper. Another property owned by the family was a dairy farm just outside of the city, managed by Fulbar's son, Dickon Hardcheese . It was also rumored that Fulbar Hardcheese tutored halflings in the rogue and thieving skills, however, that was never confirmed.</p>
<p>The halfling family still ran the Happy Cow and was known as kind and generous folk in the late 15 th century DR. They also retained the dairy farm and expanded their farming lands to a number of fields outside of town, some of which were rented out. Those friendly with the clan were also allowed to borrow coin from the Hardcheeses, which included many of the local farmers. In the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , Curran Corvalin , a hin devote of Tymora , convinced the halfling family to provide food to the refugees that were granted accommodations at Lizard's Gizzard . Curran partially financed the meals alongside the Hardcheeses.</p>
<p>By the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , moneylending had become the main business for the Hardcheese family, with the Zhentarim being their main competitor. Koggin and Lily Hardcheese ran the family business during that period of time and employed three brothers and three sisters of Koggin's, as well as a dozen nieces and nephews and a gaggle of distant relatives.</p>
