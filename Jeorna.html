<p>Jeorna was a druid member of the Emerald Grove during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Jeorna was a strong willed individual that firmly believed in the use of force to protect that which nature held most dear. While perhaps quick to anger, she was not unreasonable and abided by the hierarchy of authority within her druidic circle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Archdruid Halsin allowed a group of tieflings that were exiled from Elturel to temporarily take up residence within the Emerald Grove. Tensions rose among the druids of the grove, but reached a breaking point after Halsin took it upon himself to venture out into the Sword Coast to investigate strange events associated with mind flayers and the dark locale of Moonrise Towers .</p>
<p>When the druid Kagha took over temporary leadership, the strained circumstances made worse when she called to expel the tiefling refugees out into the world once more. A tiefling child Arabella stole the idol of Silvanus from the grove's sacred pool, preventing Kagha and those agreeable to her cause from performing the Rite of Thorns to shield their home from outsiders. A nerve-wracking standoff broke out as Jeorna and two of her fellow druids were forced to hold back Arabella's parents from entering the grove's inner sanctum, while Kagha questioned the young tiefling with the "assistance" of her viper Teela .</p>
