<p>A rod of alertness was a magic item that helped the wielder pierce illusions .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These rods resembled footman's maces with eight flanges on their head.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When used as a weapon, a rod of alertness made it slightly easier for the wielder to strike and harm their enemy, while also making them more alert to surprise attacks.</p>
<p>The rod enabled the wielder to detect alignment , evil , good , illusion , lies , magic , and invisibility when gripped tightly. If planted into the ground, the rod could sense any dangerous creatures within a 120 ft (37 m) radius. Each flange on the rod's head would emit light to a range of 60 ft (18 m) while protecting the wielder with a prayer in a 20 ft (6.1 m) radius. Lastly, the rod could animate up to 16 objects selected by the wielder that were placed around the rod.</p>
