<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Rian dreamt of visiting the lands of Rashemen , home of the mysterious Wychlaran and mighty Rashemaar berserkers .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in their life, Rian embarked upon their journey to the lands of the Unapproachable East , with the ultimate goal of visiting Rashemen.</p>
<p>Rian's journey took them to the lands of Thesk , a land of profound tolerance that acted as a great melting pot of contrasting cultures. They continued along the famed Golden Way , where they witnessed goods and peoples from the distant Hordelands and far off continent of Kara-Tur . Ignorant of those lands and their people, Rian was truly impressed, and wondered if their original dream was om fact rather ordinary.</p>
<p>While camping near the great Golden Way, Rian was approached by a traveler, who invited the author to sit with the Council of Zulkirs in the nation of Thay . Rian could hardly refuse such a kind offer, and agreed to put off their visit to Rashemen just a bit longer, and head first to nearby Thay.</p>
