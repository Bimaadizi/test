<p>Dhamir Ercals was the high priest of Cyric in Darkhold and one of the Zhentarim leaders of the fortress in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dhamir led the Second Banedeath in Darkhold, purging all non-Cyric followers. Impressed, Sememmon offered Dhamir command of the keep, which he quickly accepted, becoming the leader of the Cyricist Zhents there. But Dhamir's aims were greater: he wanted to assume control of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse and use them to advance in the Zhent hierarchy. He also started plotting an evil crusade against eastern powers like Mulhorand and Iyachtu Xvim .</p>
