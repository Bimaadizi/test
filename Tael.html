<p>The tael was the second-highest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur .</p>
<p>The tael took the form of a silver coin with a hole through the center, similar to the fen . One tael was worth 100 fen, 20 yuan , or 1 ch'ao , while 10 tael equaled 1 ch'ien . If transported to Faer√ªn circa 1357 DR , 1 tael would be treated as worth 2 to 12 silver pieces , though its actual value would be 10 silver pieces.</p>
<p>Thanks to their holes, collections of tael were threaded on strings, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.</p>
