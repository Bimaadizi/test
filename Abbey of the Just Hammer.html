<p>The Abbey of the Just Hammer was an abbey in Tasseldale , in the Dalelands , dedicated to Tyr . It was positioned close to the River Ashaba . The abbey's focus was upon the justice element of Tyr's portfolio and provided legal education for free. As of 1372 DR , the Abbey lacked numbers due to the drow threat in the north. On 22 Mirtul 1373 DR , the Abbey was attacked by the green dragon Sirvinhandra , who was defeated by Lord High Justiciar High Avenger Deren Eriach .</p>
