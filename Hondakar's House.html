<p>Hondakar's House was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<p>This big inn stood in the middle of the city's High District, and its high prices and high quality reflected that.</p>
<p>As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Hondakar's House was expressly an inn.</p>
