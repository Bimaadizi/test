<p>Therlon was a War Wizard of Cormyr in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Per Storm Silverhand 's inside information on the War Wizards, he was a good sort and not quick to resort to dangerous spells.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Therlon was good on his local knowledge of the Hullack Forest and the zone around Tethgard . He personally knew some tracking and identifying spells, though they were not powerful enough to work in Tethgard after the Spellplague .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Therlon carried out reconnaissance for a band of War Wizards sent to kill or capture Elminster Aumar and the Simbul in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , after the first stole the Royal Gorget of Battle and the latter destroyed a village in a bout of madness. The group attempted to ambush the two of them at Tethgard in the Hullack Forest, where they'd taken refuge, but were outmaneuvered and then caught in a large explosion. Therlon was not amongst the named survivors later.</p>
