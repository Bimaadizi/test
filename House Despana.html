<p>House Despana was a drow noble house which was spread across many drow cities. One was located in the Vhaeraun -dominated Rilauven in the north, another was based in the devoutly Lolth -worshiping Ust Natha further to the south. A third section of the family was a minor house of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>House Despana was a powerful noble House, with their members and branches scattered throughout the Underdark. They mainly resided in Rilauven and Ust Natha . Because of their religious preference and philosophies of life, the house was mainly split in two.</p>
<h3>Rilauven branch</h3>
<p>The most influential member of this branch was Malavon Despana , who was also a talented wizard and archmage of Rilauven . Unlike most drow, many of this branch believed in egalitarianism.</p>
<h3>Ust Natha branch</h3>
<p>This branch was headed by Matron Mother Ardulace , a powerful drow cleric. The Ust Natha branch employed the typical drow philosophy of female dominance and worship of Lolth . This branch was known for forming an alliance with Irenicus , who planned on attacking Suldanessellar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some members of the House turned against the typical matriarchal society of dark elves, and assumed power in a coup. After this, many of them went on to worship Vhaeraun instead of Lolth .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Rilhauven and Ust Natha branch were related to each other by blood, and had a dark past.</p>
