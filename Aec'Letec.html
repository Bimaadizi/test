<p>Aec'Letec was a powerful nabassu from the Abyss that was worshiped by a group of cultists from the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>While on the Prime Material Plane , Aec'Letec was capable of "resurrecting" himself in a manner, so long as one of the cultists involved with his resurrection was still alive.</p>
<p>He was completely impervious to both fire and lightning. His gaze was capable of holding an individual in place and transforming them into a ghoul after a short period of time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Centuries before the Era of Upheaval , Aec'Letec was freed from the Abyss and released onto Toril by cultists that worshiped him as a god. He was defeated shortly thereafter, by Durlag Trollkiller and Arlo of Clan Stoneblade . While the latter wound up dying from wounds he incurred in this battle, together they managed to imprison the tanar'ri 's "essence" within the artifact known as the Soultaker dagger . The dagger was then lost to time within Durlag's Tower .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Tracea Carol and their fellow cultists sought the Soultaker dagger to free Aec'Letec from his imprisonment and let him loose upon Faer√ªn in Ulgoth's Beard . Hurgan Stoneblade went searching after the dagger as well, in order to put a stop to their plan.</p>
