<p>Ironwood maces were a variety of enchanted dire mace created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , but their design was traced back to the legendary King Ethos from the Song of King Ethos bardic ballad.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of the ironwood mace weapon; each possessed a +1 , +3 , or +8 enchantments that made the mace's bludgeons deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions were ensorcelled to weigh only a portion of the material used in the creation. However, the strongest version of the weapon what was said to belong to King Ethos and possessed a magical ability to leave grievous festering wounds on the enemy.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>An ironwood mace could be created from an enchanted dire mace and a slab of ironwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the ballad penned by Duss Dorien , a good king once battled a powerful black dragon . In the fierce combat, the king lost his spear when it lodged in the wyrm's thick hide. Desperate, Ethos called out to the deity Torm for aid, and a dire mace materialized in his hands – the powerful enchanted ironwood mace . The king won by bringing the dire mace on the dragon's head with a satisfying crunch.</p>
<p>More prosaic versions of ironwood maces with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop of Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
