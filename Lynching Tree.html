<p>The Lynching Tree , also known as the Tree of Souls to followers of Kelemvor , was a massive, gnarled tree located in the Pauper's Section of Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter . Amidst its roots was the site of a mass grave for violent criminals.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After years of being the preferred place to bury accused criminals—ranging from truly despicable bandits to falsely accused innocents—the tree came to be suffused with evil energy. This resulted in such a profound twisting of the natural magic in the area that it attracted the attention of evil fey .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1479 DR , Thayan wizards in service to Valindra Shadowmantle began to tap into the tree's dark spiritual power to fuel their rituals as part of their ongoing occupation of the Neverdeath Graveyard. In response, Acolyte Mina Neyman of the Eternal Order of Kelemvor set out to cleanse the tree with the aid of adventurers .</p>
<p>Later, when the Cloaked Ascendancy conspired against Neverwinter, Archdruid Morningdawn recognized the tree as the only place in Neverwinter where she could perform a ritual to summon the twisted fey patron of Nostura , one of the Ascendancy's leaders. The ritual succeeded, summoning the hag known as Auntie Margath Bale-eye , and allowing Morningdawn to banish her with the aid of the Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge .</p>
