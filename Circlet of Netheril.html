<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The circlet appeared as a simple but elegant golden band. It was not decorated with any gems and would be considered to be too plain to be a piece of Netherese regalia. It was inscribed with obscure symbols that appeared to be arcane in origin.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The inherent powers of the circlet were hidden away upon first inspection, but could be released when it was combined with a certain kind of ioun stone .</p>
<p>When a skilled smith combined the circlet of Netheril with a bronze ioun stone , the former could grant the wearer increased intellectual capacity to retain the specifics of two powerful spells each day, beyond their normal capabilities.</p>
<p>Additionally, it bolstered the wearer's inherent vitality making them more difficult to down or slay in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Only one circlet of Netheril was known to remain in existence as of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
