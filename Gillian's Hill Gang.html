<p>Gillian's Hill Gang was a bandit group that briefly plagues the hamlet of Gillian's Hill and the adjacent patch of the Trade Way in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gillian's Hill Gang was a makeshift group of bandits assembled in the ruined tower of Gillian Cantilar on the summit of Gillian's Hill, turning it into a flophouse. They started robbing travelers and caravans that traveled along the Trade Way. Eventually, they adopted the name of Gillian's Hill Gang and became a big nuisance for Sejellus Krimp , the owner of a distribution company that operated out of the hamlet. He posted a bounty on the gang in the city of Daggerford and eventually, the individual known as the Hero of Daggerford claimed the 500 gold coins after disbanding and possibly killing the gang members.</p>
