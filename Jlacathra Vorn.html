<p>Jlacathra Vorn was a powerful sorceress in ancient Myth Drannor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jlacathra was one of the most powerful mages of the city before its fall. However, during the Weeping War , believing it impossible that some fiends could cause the ruination of the city, she disappeared from the war. Instead, she focused on creating a very powerful spell together with the Circle of the Flame cabal. At the moment of the Myth Drannor's fall, Jlacathra was planewalking and nobody saw her again.</p>
<p>However, some time after the city's fall, the Circle of Swords became operative. The magic was kept in the custody of a unique magical construct , the Floating Face .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , somehow the magic activated, calling to it some adventurers via their dreams.</p>
