<p>Nobu Chuya was a wakadoshiyori inspector in Wa around 1357 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chuya was an administrator of the Karo in Jasuga but his math skills so impressed the shogun that he was promoted to the wakadoshiyori council despite his young age. In time, he became the chief inspector of public works. However, Chuya was a corrupt individual, always accepting bribes and he had a lucrative business as a loan shark. Usually he spent all his free time in Semmishi where no vice was too indecent for his enjoyment.</p>
