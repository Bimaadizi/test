<p>Bitterroot Clan was a duergar clan of the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>According to the report of Disciple Z'rell called Beheading the Bitterroots , in the early 1490s DR, the Bitterroot Clan held Grymforge and were ruled by King Guerdon . The members of the clan were few in number but regarded as fierce opponents in combat.</p>
<p>During the Absolute crisis , the clan was a threat to the plans of the Cult of the Absolute , making it difficult to use the Underdark routes connecting the Moonrise Towers and the Shattered Sanctum . It was decided to use a squad of Orin 's doppelgangers to get rid of the clan's king. Additionally, the squad should have been tasked with throwing King Guerdon's crown into the Fathomless Depths , thus preventing the clan from crowning a new king. The "beheaded" clan would fall apart, letting the cultists bring the duergar under their control.</p>
<p>Although the details of the actual downfall of Clan Bitterroot remain unknown, by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Grymforge was under control of the Cult of the Absolute and Clan Flameshade was hired to help excavate the ruins.</p>
