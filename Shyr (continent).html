<p>Shyr was a continent on the planet of Abeir . It was the equivalent in that world to the Torilian continent of Faer没n .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The only country of this continent known to the sages of Faer没n was the realm of Shyr, of which Akan没l was once part of, until it was exchanged with parts of the lands of Chondath and western Chessenta , which in turn became part of that Abeiran continent.</p>
<p>For a time, the lands of Unther were also part of this continent.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Its known inhabitants were genasi and Primordials , such as Karshimis , who was the last known ruler of the continent before the Spellplague transported Akan没l to Toril .</p>
<p>For a time, the second incarnation of Gilgeam was also an inhabitant of Shyr.</p>
