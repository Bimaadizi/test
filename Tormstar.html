<p>Tormstar the Scarred was an assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR and a deep-cover Harper spy.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Tormstar was a ranger living peacefully in Battledale , in the Dalelands , with his wife until a werewolf started terrorizing the dale. Tormstar pursued and tracked the beast and, after a furious fight, destroyed the werewolf, only to discover that the beast was in fact his wife.</p>
<p>Scarred both in mind and body, he abandoned his ranger career and volunteered to join the Night Masks as a deep-cover spy for the Harpers, a suicide mission. He joined the Masks but, to everyone's surprise, he not only survived but also rose through the ranks, finding himself to be a very good assassin. His superiors in Those Who Harp wondered if Tormstar might not enjoy his life in Westgate too much, although he infrequently sent reports to them.</p>
