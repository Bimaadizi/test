<p>The Roving Rune was a well-known inn, tavern, and brewery in Teshburl .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was located in an old minaret , a former wizard 's tower with four levels.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Residual magic resided in this place, most noticeably, the ever-morphing tiled mosaics covering the walls on every floor, which only moved when one was not looking. In addition, on rare occasions, a magical, bluish-green rune appeared on the tiles. Touching the rune immersed one in turquoise fairie fire .</p>
<h3>Fourth Floor</h3>
<p>This level contained the residence of the innkeeper and his family. In 1370 DR , it was occupied by Atiq el Catahras and his wife and daughter.</p>
<h3>Second and Third Floors</h3>
<p>These floors contained the guest rooms, which could be rented by the night or by the hour for a moderate fee.</p>
<h3>First Floor</h3>
<p>The ground floor contained a brewery for the tavern below.</p>
<h3>Basement</h3>
<p>The basement cellar was the largest room, the inn's taproom and tavern.</p>
<h3>Sub-basement</h3>
<p>A hidden level existed in the minaret below the basement tavernâ€”a magical room. In 1370 DR , it was used by the innkeeper's daughter, Oma , for her magical studies, taught by her mother, Raisa .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Roving Rune offered a rare (for Teshburl) non-nautical theme. It provided some of the best food and entertainment around.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Atiq el Catahras inherited the tower from his uncle, who was a wizard, but he was unaware of all of the tower's secrets.</p>
<h2>Rumors and Legends</h2>
<p>Touching the roving rune was apparently a very pleasant experience, which was in part why the tavern maintained such a popularity. Those who were sad found their spirits brightened. For these reasons, many planned to say their goodbyes in the inn, hoping the rune would be spotted.</p>
