<p>Malune Nalonkrivar was the Magister from 977 DR to 983 DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>He was tall and handsome, with a beard, icy blue eyes, and sharp features.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Malune was described as a master of intrigues, and a smooth-tongued man.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As the Magister, Malune employed little beyond his own spellbook and a ring of flying . The remainder of his wealth was cached throughout Faerûn, with his possessions previous to becoming the Magister in particular being in a ruined castle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before his tenure, Malune had been an ambassador to Thay , Tharsult , Mulhorand , and Tethyr ; however, he was not seen as adequate, because of his reluctance to bluster and threaten. On the day he was offered the position of the Magister , Malune was the target of an assassination attempt; Azuth carried the two of them away from the assassins, up over the night sky of Calimport , through a ceiling that turned to gas temporarily. Malune, viewing his previous life as forfeit, accepted.</p>
<p>As the Magister, Malune traveled extensively, stopping only to aid mages and experience local delights; his acumen with business ensured he never had any trouble with money, while his power was sufficient to casually win duels. He died in the Tunland , after the winter snows of 983 DR swelled the swamps; on stopping to rest, he accidentally wandered into a black dragon 's ambush. The dragon, Constulgrael , decapitated him with a single bite before he could do anything.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>It is said many of the mages Malune stopped to aid were young, comely women; Malune judged this was so, and viewed it as a sign of Mystra 's favor, for she brought such delights close by.</p>
