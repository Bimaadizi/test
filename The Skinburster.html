<p>The Skinburster was an enchanted halberd that allowed the wielder to accumulate force energy, created sometime before the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Skinburster 's enchantments made the weapon emit a gentle yellow light in which its curved blade resembled an unnerving smile. The weapon also possessed a simple +1 enchantment that made its blade more deadly, and it guided the wielder's aim towards the target. Lastly, the weapon's skinburster force magic imbued the wielder with a charge of magical force energy upon a successful strike, making them a force conduit for twelve seconds. By itself, this enchantment had little utility but could be synergized with other magic items that allowed for the release of the accumulated force.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , The Skinburster belonged to Inquisitor W'wargaz of Crèche Y'llek . The weapon was stored in W'wargaz's quarters in the ruined Rosymorn Monastery, in the chamber that once hid relics of the monastery.</p>
