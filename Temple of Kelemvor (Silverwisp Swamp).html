<p>The temple of Kelemvor in the Silverwisp Swamp was a holy fortification dedicated to Kelemvor the Lord of the Dead, that came into use throughout the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The temple was situated nearby the ruined village of Grimhollow within the Silverwisp Swamp, along the Sword Coast region of the North .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The wood-and-stone temple was heavily damaged, but enough of the structure remained to offer protection from the undead and vicious creatures beyond.</p>
<p>Statues of robed, skeletal figures adorned its main entrance, flanked by banners depicting Kelemvor's holy symbol . A large brazier and several sconces illuminated by blue fire provided light amid the encroaching fog that permeated the swamp.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Defense of the temple was minimal, lone sentries stood at the temple's perimeter monitoring for any emergent threats.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during or before the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Silverwisp swamp became overrun by undead under the command of a powerful Netherese spellcaster called Idris . After the threat of the undead became apparent, Lord Dagult Neverember directed a force of the Neverwinter Guard and doomguides of Kelemvor led by Vesper Soulhearth to defeat Idris and her undead minions. The expedition was an abject failure. Soulhearth remained the sole survivor of the assault forces and retreated back to the temple within the swamp. Joined by a handful of others, Soulhearth did all he could to hold the undead at bay and prevent them from overwhelming the surrounding lands.</p>
<p>Some time later, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge reopened lines of communication with Soulhearth and his allies. Working together, the pair and their allies successfully defended the temple against an assault from the Barrow Lords , then struck out against them in their own lairs. The hero then ventured into Royal Rise to dismantle the direhelm forge used by Idris and her shadar-kai allies, and finally destroyed the Netherese lich once and for all.</p>
