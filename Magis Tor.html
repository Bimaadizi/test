<h2>History</h2>
<p>Magis Tor served as the base for a group of adventuring mages of Tethyr known as Magis Mir . Before the Year of the Bright Blade, 1347 DR and the Ten Black Days of Eleint , members of Magis Mir were opponents of all malevolent undead creatures and the infamous Twisted Rune . Magis Mir went missing seven months after they defeated Runecount Tuvos Akasi during the Ten Black Days. As of the late 14 th century DR , the adventuring band had not been seen nor heard from since their disappearance. It was believed that Magis Tor could only be entered by the individuals wearing a special ring . Each member of Magis Mir had one such ring in their possessions.</p>
