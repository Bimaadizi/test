<p>Takosh-Re was a pharaoh from the dynasty of Mo-Pelar and the father of Amun-Re .</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Per the Book of Amun-Re , Amun-Re's father told him of the power of the waters of Athis , which they considered the very gift of Isis , while Amun-Re was young. Upon his death, Takosh-Re was buried in the manner of other pharaohs, being succeeded by his son, Amun-Re.</p>
<p>When the younger pharaoh heard that his father's tomb may have been looted, he headed there alone. He became enraged and horrified by the desecration; this made Amun-Re vow that his tomb would be theft-proof, so that he could not be cheated of his place in Heaven Westward.</p>
