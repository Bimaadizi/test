<p>Krashos Morueme was a blue dragon of the legendary Morueme dragon clan. He resided in Ched Nasad under the alias of Quevven Jusztiirn , professing to be a venerable drow mage .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>In addition to the formidable abilities that other blue dragons of his age can muster. Krashos Morueme was a skilled spellcaster, able to hide his true form under the guise of a drow with his magic for over 50 years.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>A few decades after the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR , Krashos' mother was driven from the rest of the clan when she reached maturity.</p>
<p>Krashos began visiting Ched Nasad in the 1320's DR to search for Netherese artifacts but quickly became enamoured with city of shimmering webs, so much so that he remained there. Adopting the alias of Quevven Jusztriin, an elderly drow , Krashos professed to have fled the sectarian unrest in Eryndlyn .</p>
<h3>The Fall of Ched Nasad</h3>
<p>On 3 Uktar 1372 DR , Ched Nasad was destroyed by the Stonefire bombs of the Duergar of Gracklstugh . During the collapse, Krashos was on the bottomost layer of the city and was subsequently buried by the falling ruins. Lacking the magic to escape, Krashos' only option was to return to his true form and burrow out, escaping the city.</p>
<p>Slaying most other slaves who had followed him out of the wreckage, Krashos spared a fire genasi known as Hurnoj Rikrekts to use as his agent. With Hurnoj acting as his eyes and hands in the collapsed city, Krashos had his agent sift through the rubble to look for any of his missing hoard and to even keep an eye for some items of others that he coveted.</p>
