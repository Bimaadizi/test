<p>A Docent was a kind of sentient magical object that could be used by warforged as an augmentation to their form. Though native to the isolated world of Eberron , similar artifacts were not unknown in the lands of Faerûn , either.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Docents were typically embedded inside the body of a warforged, most often inside the chest. Eberronian Docents were usually made of metal, but objects that functioned similarly to them could also be made from gemstones , wood, stone, or dragonscales .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Docents could be made to impart almost any sort of magical effect, but most improved the bearer's resistance to physical and magical harm, acting not too differently in utility from a variety of other defensive magical items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As warforged were not known to Faerûn, Docents were likewise an unknown concept. However, when some adventurers from Eberron arrived in the mid-1480s DR , various local magical artifacts were identified as similar enough to Docents as to be considered interchangeable.</p>
