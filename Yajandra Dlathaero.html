<p>Later, Yajandra went on a spell-trading trip to Amn . She disappeared for some years studying dragons . She resurfaced visiting Candlekeep and later in Zazesspur where she studied with the sage Cthethros , a great dragon expert.</p>
<p>Later Yajandra wandered Amn together with the disguised gold dragon Sandro until a Harper told her about the Well of Dragons .</p>
<p>Yajandra bought a house in the nearby village of Ladydove and hers was the only house to survive an attack from the Dire Dragon . So Yajandra transformed the house into an inn and continued her dragon studies with the profits of the inn.</p>
