<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ernest had delicate features and long silky brown hair. She wore a minstrel 's garb and a large beret, topped with a large decorative feather. She was depicted playing a lute , yet appearing disconsolately bored.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a portrait of Ernest Tillerturn painted by Oskar Fevras was kept in the attic of the Jannath estate of Baldur's Gate. That year, it became possessed by wailing poltergeist unwittingly summoned by the painter. Other copies of the same lute-playing depiction were seen across the city of Baldur's Gate.</p>
