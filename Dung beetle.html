<p>After Volothamp Geddarm 's work, Volo's Guide to All Things Magical , was published circa 1369 DR , he angered a great number of wizards . Snilloc threatened Volo with spending the eternity as a dung beetle.</p>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , Purfbin Doogrick , a rogueish adventurer from Waterdeep was stuck in Lady Spitalsmore 's basement, as the noblewoman came back home earlier than anticipated. The ingenious gnome used a handful of Modovian dung beetle‎s to fashion a trap for lizards and then used lizards to scare the old woman out of her home, allowing the little thief to escape with a handful of food from the Waterdhavian noble's pantry.</p>
