<p>Vuerthyl was an artificially-created oasis in Anauroch , that was created by the Zhentarim , and was a stop along the Black Road .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The oasis comprised a number of fruit trees that grew atop an underground reservoir. Like many of the Zhentarim-made oases, Vuerthyl was formed using a decanter of endless water .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Vuerthyl was located in the northwestern region of the Sword , north of the Jackal Hills .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The oasis outpost was manned by seven journeyman Zhentarim wizards and a contingent of 20 veteran Zhentilar soldiers.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, the Zhents at Vuerthyl discovered a great wealth of naturally-occurring beryl and emeralds hidden away in the reservoir beneath the oasis. While digging beneath the ground they unwittingly released a mind flayer that had been imprisoned beneath the sands, a being that was since out on the loose.</p>
