<p>Barze was a Netherese arcanist and later a sorcerer-king of his self-titled Kingdom of Barze .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Hostile Badgers, −457 DR , the war-weary Barze and his followers fled persecution in Netheril. They left the Negarath Enclave and traveled east for many months. At the start of winter, they discovered a fertile dale, and it was there that Barze founded his kingdom.</p>
<p>The sorcerer-king was happy until the Year of Sycophants, −357 DR , when the threat of Maram of the Great Spear prompted Barze to pledge his wizards to an alliance led by the Dark Three . However, they would betray him within a year. An assassin killed him stealthily and without a fight, leaving his kingdom to fall to the Twisted Ones .</p>
<p>Barze's tale would be remembered in part within texts later deemed to be heretical by followers of the Dead Three . As of the late 15 th century DR , he was the subject of a chapter in a book called The Great Diaspora of Netheril .</p>
