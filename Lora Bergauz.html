<p>Lora Bergauz was a retired sailor and a patron of the Blushing Mermaid in the city of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lora was a human woman with freckled bronze skin, blue eyes, and red hair. She wore a commoner's garb and carried a quarterstaff .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Lora was a cleric who followed a deity of the light domain . As a priest, she had access to such spells as guiding bolt , sacred flame , and spirit guardians . As a cleric of light, she could channel divinity into a radiance of the dawn .</p>
<h2>Posessions</h2>
<p>Lora's small home was located in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate, not far from the Blushing Mermaid and the docks. Apart from a quarterstaff, Lora owned a unique and powerful rapier she received from her famed mother – Duellist's Prerogative . She also wore a potent enchanted amulet – the amulet of Windrider .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lora's mother was Lenore the Fleet , a duelist and a sailor, whose name came from her legwork in battle and not from her naval skills. Lora's daughter was Vanra Bergauz , still a child in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<p>Tim Twofingers was Lora's friend with whom she sailed aboard the Liberty , sometime before helming her own vessel. She maintained the friendship with Tim after settling on land and Tim, in turn, loved his old comrade and her daughter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lora Bergauz retired to the city of Baldur's Gate with her daughter after selling her ship – Starborn , a three-masted gaff , a Valor-class vessel, five-gun sixth rate. Despite its damaged condition, with two of the five guns broken, Lora received a bid of 10,000 gold pieces from an anonymous buyer.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , during the time Captain Grisly was replaced by the green hag Auntie Ethel as the owner of the Blushing Mermaid, Lora's seven-year-old daughter mysteriously disappeared during an evening of drinks there. When she came to her senses, Vanra was missing, and everyone at the Mermaid seemed to believe that the girl never existed and Lora was there alone, meeting and drinking with friends. Distraught and desperate, Lora tried to threaten the bar staff with a dagger , but no one believed her story. She eventually attempted to report the disappearance to Liara Portyr at the Basilisk Gate barracks. The Flaming Fist Blaze's investigation uncovered a lead. Still, when Lora arrived at the barracks, Liara Portyr seemed unable to focus on the problem and talked in circles, not willing nor able to comprehend the crime, as if some mind-magics afflicted her. She may have gotten lucky coming across the group called the Absolute Adversaries , who offered to help the distraught mother.</p>
<p>Vanra Bergauz, still a child, was captured by Captain Grisly, or more precisely, Auntie Ethel, and consumed as a grim act of hag procreation. The heroes could've decided to save the child and, by using the hag's bane potion , extracted the child alive and unharmed from the hag's belly. By other accords, Vanra was rescued, but the adventurers failed to save the child's life, breaking Lora's heart. And the last possibility was the "heroes" taking a grim or cruelly utilitarian approach and allowing the hag to gestate the child into a new hag in exchange for Auntie Ethel's help in defense of the Gate during the War with the Absolute .</p>
