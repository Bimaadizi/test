<p>Maddgoth's Castle was the seventh level of Undermountain . It was named after a miniature, 1:12-scale fortress in one of its caverns. The castle served as a base of operations for a serial killer called Maddgoth , who specialized in bringing home wizards and killing them. He was known to be very old, although it was unclear if he was an archmage who had prolonged his life with potions of longevity or a lich . Anyone who entered the castle shrank to one-twelfth their normal size.</p>
