<p>Of Style and Grace was a magic shop in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 th century DR that specialized in spell components . The shop's name was a play on words of the owner's name, Grace Stiles .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This shop was located roughly within the Gowntown neighborhood of the city's Temple District , standing along Fire Lane .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>This shop stood within a fairly good-sized stone building with six pillars that stood outside. It was only a single story, but the building was quite tall. A wooden sign hung above its entrance that read "Of Style and Grace" in jagged Common lettering and beneath that had a pentagram burnt into it. The sign was considered to be unsettling by most Ravenians. Upon opening the entry door, a small bell would ring.</p>
<p>The interior of the building had a vaulted ceiling and was divided into two sections, with the front serving as the shop and the rear serving as both the living quarters of the owner and the store's storage space. A narrow hallway led into the back half of the building, separated by a counter. The counter was modest and not very functional, serving only to deter patrons from wandering into the backroom.</p>
<p>The shop had a large pentagram carved into its wooden flooring, with the outline filled with silver . A large red velvet chair stood at its center, along with a small stand with a silver bowl of peaches . The owner could often be found sitting there, reading some magical tome .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Of Style and Grace specialized in selling spell components, though it did not keep them on open display. Rather Grace would fetch the desired components from storage and do transactions with a purse she wore around her waist at all times.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Among some, the shop carried a reputation of dealing in evil magic, which was a misconception born from the owner's predilection for collecting cursed items . However, as she found mild amusement in these rumors, she did nothing to quell them, considering them to be little more than harmless fun.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in the late 14 th century DR, a group of adventurers visited Of Style and Grace under the direction of John Porter in hopes of finding a means to cure Marian Wicksal of poison she had ingested. Hesitant to aid someone she considered her long-time rival, Grace directed the adventurers to seek out a herbalist in Crow's End that went by the moniker of The Root Lady .</p>
<p>Later, another group of adventurers visited Of Style and Grace after being told by Aaron Fleeting that it was where the illusionist con artist Mortimer Mittlemer typically shopped for spell components, but this was a clever lie meant to give Fleeting time to make distance between him and the adventurers. When questioned, Grace denied knowing anything about Aaron, his sister Erin Fleetwing , or Mortimer, though expressed resentment over being associated with the con artist.</p>
