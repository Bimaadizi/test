<p>Sheep were a common species of mammal and herd animal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sheep were covered in thick, curly wool. The color of the wool varied, often black, white or yellow in color. Male sheep had a pair of sharp horns on their head.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>A flock of sheep was tended by shepherds. The larger the flock, the more shepherds were needed to safely manage the sheep.</p>
<p>Shepherds moved flocks from one area to another for grazing. This was due to the fact that sheep, when grazing, ate grass in its entirety, including roots. This combined with the damage caused by many sets of hooves, degraded the soil and left it exposed to the sun and wind. Improper management of a flock of sheep could turn a once lush field into a barren dusty field.</p>
<p>Among the Al-Badia tribes, shepherds were usually young men or boys. They led the flock to find suitable grazing ground. However, in the summer, grazing is practically nonexistent, so the Al-Badia tribes remain close to an oasis or settlement.</p>

When entering an unexplored dungeon, uncaring adventures were known to send a flock of sheep ahead of them to trigger any traps that laid ahead.</p>
<p>In the High Country , there were certain locations felt to be important to the Hidden People , such as sparkling pools, the rare standing stones, and small hidden dells thick with old, mossy trees. Wise and experienced shepherds avoided such places. If forced to enter by weather or misfortune, they made no fires and cut no trees, moved stealthily, and did their business quickly and left as soon as possible.
