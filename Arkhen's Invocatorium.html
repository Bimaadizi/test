<p>Arkhen's Invocatorium was a college of magic in Silverymoon that specialized in sorcery and invocation magic. Once an independent institution, its relocation came with being subsumed into the Conclave of Silverymoon .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Invocatorium was once situated in a stone fortress, on the east side of Silverymoon's Northbank . It later moved into an entirely new building in the Southbank , between the Lady's College and Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The school took its name from its head teacher, Arkhen the Icy , the Magus Invoker at the Conclave of Silverymoon and later Master Sorcerer. He was an infamously strict teacher.</p>
<p>The second building to call the Invocatorium home full of many furnishings, almost all of whom were animated constructs under the command of Arkhen.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the past the stone fortress that would later be home to the Invocatorium was a garrison post for Silverymoon's soldiers. Around the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR , Arkhen moved into the fortress and turned it into a school for magic. This state of affairs was maintained until 1370Â DR , when the building suffered extensive structural damage as a result of two spectacular spell miscastings by students who were subsequently expelled. Following this incident, the High Mage Alustriel Silverhand implored Arkhen to abandon the building and move his school to a new building.</p>
