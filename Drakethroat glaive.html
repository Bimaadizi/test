<p>Drakethroat glaive was an enchanted glaive that was a gift from Kereska , the Wonderbringer.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Drakethroat glaive possessed a formidable +2 enchantment that guided the blade towards the target and made its slashes more devastating than a mundane glaive. Those who wilded the weapon were granted the ability to unleash vicious dragon breath , a more powerful variant of a dragonborn 's breath weapon. Additionally, the wielder could cast draconic elemental weapon spell once per day, imbuing the glaive with magical energies of a chosen element.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before the late 15 th century DR , the draconic deity Kereska aided a dragonborn who faced a group of carbuncular spiders by gifting a drakethroat glaive to them. The dragonborn successfully survived the battle. Some time later, by the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , drakethroat glaive ended up in the hands of a Zhentish agent and merchant, Roah Moonglow , who worked with the Cult of the Absolute . The enchanted glaive could be found with Roah during her stay at the Moonrise Towers in the Western Heartlands .</p>
