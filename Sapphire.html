<p>Sapphire was a rare variety of corundum that occurred in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sapphire was found in shades of pale blue to deep azure. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp.</p>
<p>Sapphires were considered sacred by followers of Aerdrie Faenya , Deep Duerra , Eldath , Gaerdal Ironhand â€”appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. Black sapphires specifically were recognized as a sign of approval from Bane , and sacred to followers of Labelas Enoreth , Laduguer , Lolth , Shargaas , and Vhaeraun .</p>
<p>In most stones, dazzling blue color of sapphires was achieved via exposing them to extremely high temperatures. This process was called "cooking". The color change was permanent, however it did not affect the gem's durability.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Realmslore held that sapphires increased magical skill and strength and therefore they were used in creating magic blades and items that affected the mind, magical prowess, and the element of air. However, sapphires had a dampening effect on magically induced fear, rage, despair, or insanity and could partially protect the wearer from these effects. When used as a spell component, sapphires ensured the greatest initial effect (usually damage) upon first impact and the longest possible duration. The most auspicious time of day to use sapphires was midmorn .</p>
<p>With proper preparation, which included bathing the item in a mixture containing powdered sapphire, mounting a large whole sapphire of at least 5,000 gp value on an item such as a sword gave a better than 50 percent chance that the enchantment bonus would be increased. This could be done at the initial enchantment of the item or as a way of possibly improving an already enchanted item.</p>
<p>Sapphires were a required material component for casting some versions of Drawmij's instant summons .</p>
<p>Crushed sapphires were a part of ice golem creation. The runes engraved on their bodies were imbued with snow-like lichen and sapphire dust.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Sapphires were considered prized gems among the drow . They especially liked those of darker hues.</p>
<p>Terar-shaped sapphire necklaces were often worn by the noble members of the noble Baldurian patriar families during times of mourning. The precious stones represented the weight they felt after suffering great loss.</p>
<p>Akabar Bel Akash , like many other married Turmishmen , wore a sapphire earing, that indicated his marital status.</p>
<p>The gem dragon sorceress Nyadnar was especially fond of sapphires.</p>
