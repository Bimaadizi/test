<p>The Calim Jewel Emporium was a jeweler's shop located in Little Calimshan within the Outer City of Baldur's Gate .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>In addition to being the home to perhaps the most well-regarded Baldurian jeweler of the late 15 th century, the emporium served as a forum for local agents of criminal organization known as the Guild . The emporium was owned by the Guild Kingpin of Little Calimshan, Rilsa Rael . She used her establishment as a headquarters for guild members and to host public events for the people of her neighborhood and the rest of the Outer City.</p>
<p>In addition to its civic-and-criminal-oriented activities, the emporium functioned as any other jeweler's business â€” with the distinction of having sterling reputation. Its lapidary was among the Gate's finest and it was considered one of the best places to sell stolen gems and jewels.</p>
