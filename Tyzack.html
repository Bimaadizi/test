<p>Tyzack was a male human commander of the Zhentilar Company of the Scorpions during the Time of Troubles .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he was young, Tyzack tried to rebel against the Zhentarim and killed a young cleric of Bane in a little temple north of Zhentil Keep . From then on, Tyzack lived in fear that someone would discover his secret.</p>
<p>Later, Tyzack joined the Zhentilar army and soon become the leader of the Company of the Scorpions. Furing the Time of Troubles, he and his men met the mortal Cyric , by that time starting his career in evil, and soon Cyric become the second-in-command of the company. All the previous bearers of the title had been killed by Tyzack's personal assassin Ren for discovering the captain's secret.</p>
<p>In the end, during a rain of metal blades, a manifestation of the crazy magic of that time, Tyzack died, probably killed by Ren who considered Cyric a better commander.</p>
