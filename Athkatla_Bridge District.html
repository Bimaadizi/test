<p>The Bridge District of Athkatla was one of the city's poorer quarters, situated on the southern reach of the Alandor River , just south of the bridge that spanned its waters.</p>
<p>It was home to a fair number of low-end businesses, tiny hole-in-the-wall shops selling second-hand or illegal wares. Many of these catered to the merchants and travelers who made their living along the caravan routes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The district had narrow, winding streets lined with rowhouses of some of the poorer Athkatlan citizens. Among these were the city's laborers, street-side cart vendors, shop assistants and the like.</p>
