<p>Seaglimpse , formerly known as the Warehouse District prior to the Three Women War , was an out-of-the-way neighborhood of Ravens Bluff 's Harbor District . Even after its rezoning as a neighborhood in the Harbor District, some continued to refer to the area by its old moniker.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Seaglimpse was situated outside of Ravens Bluff's protective stone walls, running up against the eastern walls of the Foreign District , and stood opposite the neighborhood of Silverscales or "Ol'Town" as some referred to it. The Front was the main thoroughfare that spanned its western side.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Seaglimpse's docks took in a great number of ships that came in from the Dragon Reach . The area was frequently pounded with rain and wind from storms, forcing sailors to chain their vessels down to several wharves to avoid being driven to wreck on the shore. Seaglimpse offered little in the way to attract visitors and tourists, unless someone specifically sought the smell of dead fish and the spray of salt water.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>To remain vigilant against smuggling and illegal shipping shopping operations, the City Watch maintained regular patrols along the docks. Before such a presence, it was not uncommon to see longshoremen repacking and relabeling cargo and even live slave -auctioning in wide open view.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The area long had a history for seedy behavior, but criminal activity was significantly dampened in the early 14 th century DR, circa 1335 DR â€“ 1350 DR , by the actions of Rolf Sunriver over the course of his first fifteen years in the City Watch.</p>
<p>Around the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR , as the Grand Conjunction was nearing in the Domains of Dread the boundaries between that plane of existence and the Prime Material plane were weakening, allowing for portals to open sporadically between the two around the Vast . From one such portal came a pyre elemental that found itself trapped in an iron flask by a cult of fire worshipers from Crow's Foot called the Cult of Red Ruin . Over the next two weeks the cultists caused several fires in Ravens Bluff, until finally causing a significant fire wave of fires in Crow's Foot, Ol'Town, and the Warehouse District. In the Warehouse District the fires were of such severity that they threatened to destroy several square blocks of buildings. The Red Ravens managed to arrive on the scene and put out the fires, but by then some residential buildings had been destroyed.</p>
