<h2>History</h2>
<p>Isteval's place of birth was the Cormyrian town of Eveningstar . He joined the Purple Dragons while still a teenager, and was noted for his impeccable character. His desire to bring justice and defend his country brought him into conflict with many enemies in various locations. He fought against the vicious orc bands of the Stonelands , dispatched Zhentarim agents along the western frontier, and made a valiant stand in Thunder Gap against Sembian raiders.</p>
<p>Later, he led at least three groups of adventurers on missions in an effort to bring justice and goodness, and spread Cormyr's influence. The first company of adventurers went to the Western Heartlands . The second followed Isteval to battle corruption around the Moonsea .</p>
<p>Around 1471 DR , Isteval led his third and last company, the Company of the Sunlit Sea , into the Vilhon Wilds and the Winterwood . During this time, Isteval and the rest of his company entered the lair of the dracolich , Dretchroyaster , to retrieve the Diamond Staff of Chomylla . Here, Isteval battled a black dragon within the adjacent caverns. Some time later, Isteval wounded his leg in battle against a green dragon . The wound resisted magical healing and he walked with a cane afterwards.</p>
<p>Sir Isteval lived out his retirement in Daggerford until he felt that others needed to follow the shining example that was his homeland, so he gathered individuals with the same ideals and set forth to combat evil and chaos once more.</p>
<p>He attended the Council of Waterdeep in the 1480s DR, as Daggerford's unofficial representative for the Lords' Alliance . Isteval was however additionally tasked with spying on the council on behalf of Cormyr, a fact he respected his fellow representatives too much to hide from them, resulting in him almost being banished from the council, if not for the intervention of a group of heroes leading the efforts against the Cult of the Dragon . As the council progressed, Isteval shared similar values as Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet . Isteval had his misgivings about cooperating with the Zhentarim , and outright objected to allying with the Red Wizards of Thay .</p>
<p>It was around the era of the Second Sundering that Isteval actively proclaimed his devotion to the newly returned Lathander .</p>
