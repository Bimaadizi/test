<p>Haresk's Hardware Emporium was a cluttered general store in Ashabenford that had been in the Malorn family of Mistledale for generations. It used to be run by the High Councilor Haresk Malorn but he delegated that responsibility to elderly family members and trusted assistants since he assumed elected office.</p>
<p>One item of note in the shop was a 12-foot-long wooden shark that hung from the ceiling. It was said to have been used by a wizard long ago to rid the River Ashaba of the quelzarn .</p>
