<p>Tran was a seaport town in Laothan in Malatra .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It lay at the mouth of the Phu River on the coast of the Eastern Sea . A trail led westward through the jungle and along the river to Laothan's capital, Cheinang .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tran was home to a "floating city", a great conglomerate of of boats that bore houses and businesses and were all interconnected. It was nearly self-sufficient and was the heart of life here.</p>
<h2>Economy</h2>
<p>In the midâ€“14 th century DR , Tran received trade passing along the Phu River, between the sea and Cheinang, though it was reported to be only middling compared to Marabaya in the Kuong Kingdom .</p>
<p>Yet lawlessness was said to be rife in Tran: almost anything could be bought, any vice could be had, and killers could be hired cheaply. These included the Sung clan of ninja , who operated in the floating city.</p>
