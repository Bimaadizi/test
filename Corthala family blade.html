<p>The Corthala family blade was an enchanted katana that could only be wielded by members of the Corthala family, created long before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Corthala family blade possessed a strong +2 enchantment to its blade, making the weapons more ready and guiding it towards the target. This enchantment also made the katana deadly to creatures otherwise unaffected by mundane weapons. Lastly, each slash with the blade left behind a bleeding wound that slowly drained the opponents' vitality. The blade radiated magical energy but only when in the hands an a Corthala.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Valygar Corthala was believed to be the last surviving member of the Corthala family and as such, he was the only man capable of wielding the katana. Valygar wielded his family blade when his paths crossed with Abdel Adrian and his companions during the Bhaalspawn crisis .</p>
