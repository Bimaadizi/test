<p>A censer of blood was a powerful magical censer that could create vampiric mists in exchange for blood.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Both the censer itself and the chain that it hung from were made from brass . It was inscribed with symbols of fiends and names belonging to ancient vampires . When it was about to create a vampiric mist, it would produce steam.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>While a creature was attuned to a censer of blood , they could drip a single drop of their own blood into it. This would cause up to six vampiric mists to appear in the area immediately surrounding them. If the creature using the censer was in sunlight, no vampiric mists would appear. Creating vampiric mists with the censer significantly depleted the user's energy. The creature could then command the vampiric mists or dismiss them at will.</p>
<p>In addition to this, being attuned to the vampiric mist also heightened a creature's sense of smell. They became more skilled at tracking creatures by their scent, and to smell in general. They could use these heightened senses to detect creatures within 60 feet (18 meters) of them that had been injured.</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>The oinoloth Malika Tahoun brought a censer of blood with it when it led a force of yugoloths to the material plane to destroy Cube 1717 and end the pixelation curse . Malika used the censer to summon at least seven vampiric mists. When the yugoloths were attacked by a pixelated balhannoth , the censer was left behind near a pool of water on the surface of Cube 1717. The balhannoth was unaware of the censer's power and used its obvious value to tempt visitors into its clutches. Malika Tahoun was captured by the skull lord Vargo but wished to recover the magic item.</p>
