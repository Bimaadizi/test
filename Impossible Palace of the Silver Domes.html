<p>The Impossible Palace of the Silver Domes was a fabled palace in Shou Lung in Kara-Tur and in truth the home of the great lung dragon Mei Lung , Grand Historian of the Celestial Empire . Seemingly appearing at random times and places all around the empire throughout the course of its history, it was the subject of much speculation and interest.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It had eight large sections, each topped with a silver dome, for which it was named.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>To the outside world, the Impossible Palace was an impossible mystery. Many groups had tried to explore it over the centuries, and were never seen again. Mei Lung found much of what was written about the Impossible Palace in the Shichi Hsi , the Histories, to be false and fantastical.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Mei Lung relocated it regularly, often to the bed of a deep river or to some other hidden and hard-to-reach place to avoid unwanted visitors, and occasionally to areas facing a grave threat, at which times it was most obvious and accessible.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Impossible Palace was the lair of the dragon Mei Lung. He did not appreciate trespassers within his palace or those who disturbed his privacy without good reason—in fact, he tended to eat them. Most adventuring companies who tried met this fate. Only those heroes who still dared during a crisis might be met by more than his fangs. To those, Mei Lung gave tests, from games of riddles to battles with dangerous monsters, and sometimes simple conversation on current events or classic works of art and literature, depending on his whims and the situation. Only when he had the measure of a visitor's true nature did he decide whether to aid them, or devour them.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Impossible Palace of the Silver Domes was first observed at Sei Kung in Arakin province in Shou Year 413 (−837 DR) , when agents of the emperor first discovered it. It was considered to be the most interesting thing to have happened there even millennia later.</p>
<p>The palace disappeared in Shou Year 601 (−649 DR) , leaving behind a place that came to be known as "The Field of Burnished Bronze".</p>
<p>The Impossible Palace reappeared in Shou Year 1004 (−246 DR) , but this time disappeared again only two weeks later.</p>
<p>The hero Wo Mai once contacted the Tsui Tong to learn the current location of the Impossible Palace, in order to recover the Silver Flower Sword of Tan Ming . Evidently the dragon was caught on a good day, for Mei Lung only chatted with Wo Mai, who survived and later became emperor in Shou Year 1025 (−225 DR) .</p>
<p>It made a brief appearance in Shou Year 1810 (560 DR) , but before any study could be conducted, it vanished once again.</p>
<p>In Shou Year 2011 (761 DR) , the Impossible Palace made another appearance and this time investigators managed to get inside. But it disappeared again before they could get out.</p>
<p>Around 1350 DR , Mei Lung found the young siblings Meo Cha and Meo Li washed up on a beach at Yu Tai Shuni in Shou Lung, having survived the tsunami that destroyed the invasion fleet of the king of Silla . He allowed them to live in his house, where he gladly heard tales of their homeland, Koryo , before they returned there.</p>
