<p>Mekrath was a powerful elven wizard in Athkatla , Amn .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Mekrath held a very important gem in his altar. His captive, Haer'Dalis claimed that it was stolen from him by the wizard. He fought with a quarterstaff, and wore a robe of fire resistance.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The wizard set up his lair above the Athkatlan sewers. Mekrath was not very tolerant of visitors, especially thieves, and when he found Haer'Dalis thieving in his lair, he enslaved him. The elven wizard may have asked of Gorion's Ward a task. The ward could have killed Mekrath or performed this task for him for Haer'Dalis' freedom.</p>
<p>Upon the freedom of Haer'Dalis, the once-slave read out a poem he had composed.</p>
