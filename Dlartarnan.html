<p>After overcoming most of the obstacles they came to an apparent extradimensional space made of rows balconies opening on the inside of a single cylindrical room; their hallway terminated in such a balcony, but behind them, he noticed the passageway changed to the entrance to Ondil's tomb. They tried other balconies, but all of them led to the same space. Finally engaging with the path leading to Ondil's tomb, he tried to pry the door open with his sword. The door retaliated with a flame that reduced him to ashes on the spot.</p>
