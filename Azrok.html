<h2>History</h2>
<p>Azrok was born blind in a hobgoblin clan in Undermountain. Normally, his disability would doom him but Azrok's mother, a powerful sorceress , crafted for him a dagger of blindsight that permitted him to see as a normal hobgoblin. In time, Azrok became the leader of his clan and with great wisdom settled his people inside the Sargauth Level where they prospered, killing the local grimlocks and troglodytes . Azrok even sired an heir and his people renamed themselves the Legion of Azrok .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Kessandro Rosznar went to met Azrok in order to start a slaving business together but instead Azrok killed the young Rosznar for his failing to show the proper respect to the warlord.</p>
<p>Some time after, some duergar thieves of Clan Ironeye stole Azrok's magical dagger. Using this advantage, the drow of House Auvryndar managed to settle in the level without too many attacks from Azrok's army. His wife and lieutenant Lurkana tried to cover for Azrok's weakness but her efforts were ruined by a mind flayer ambassador of Skullport who used some intellect devourer infiltrators to spread the truth about Azrok's condition. Many of his bugbearÂ and goblin minions abandoned Azrok and went to Skullport to join the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild . Afterward, Azrok feared an invasion from Skullport into his dominion and a very probable new attack by House Auvryndar.</p>
