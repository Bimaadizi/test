<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Wode sold wares in the area south of a House Despana camp, near Rilauven . The drow elf, along with his derro and dwarven associates, sold a large amount of wares. Their wares included weapons, armor, magically enhanced items, and ammunition.</p>
<p>He was boastful about his "glorious" home city of Ched Nasad . He referred to it as the "black opal of drow cities" and said it "gleams across the Underdark as a shining example to all others who hope to be truly great". The only city he felt was more welcoming to merchants was Sshamath .</p>
<p>Wode journeyed close to Rilauven every three years to meet with his associates, Myrvek and Heggr . He mentioned that "Old Heggr" disliked dealing with himself and Myrvek.</p>
<p>His market was decorated with fine spider silk carpets made by master craftsmen.</p>
<p>Wode was the only merchant among his associates who had a bodyguard. His guard, named Valas Rrostarr , was protective and did not like to engage in conversation.</p>
<p>He used axes in combat, making use of both their melee and throwing potential.</p>
