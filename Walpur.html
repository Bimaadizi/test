<h2>History</h2>
<p>Walpur was originally a underworld enforcer, but eventually transferred his skills to adventuring with the Stag Runners.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , he joined his allies at Thistleflame Keep for a party hosted by Lord Partic Thistle . The bardic entertainer Mendryll Belarod proceeded to sing an outrageous ballad that degraded Sembites, enraging the Stag Runners. Walpur and his friends then proceeded to attempt to beat some respect into Mendryll, only to be foiled by another adventuring party.</p>
