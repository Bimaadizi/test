<p>Zundbridge was a massive, squat bridge located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Waterdeep , where the Trade Way crossed the Dessarin River . The bridge was named after the wizard Zund , who created it. As of 1370 DR , the bridge had held firm without repairs for more than ninety winters.</p>
<p>Waterdeep maintained a castle there on a rocky outcropping above the river gorge. The castle's outer wall protected a large area used to inspect caravans while the inner wall protected garrison buildings. The castle had three griffons at its disposal.</p>
<p>Zund was said to have used a stone golem to build the bridge, and over the years many sought to find it and command it.</p>
