<p>Orthalar of the Winds was a mage from Calimport in the early-to-mid 3 rd century DR . He was hired by Felodar Aumar to seize control of Athalantar .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The wizard owned a home in Hastarl , Athalantar.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Orthalar was one of the Night Mages that worked by night to try to seize control of Athalantar for Felodar Aumar , whilst hiding from the Magelords of Athalantar during the day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orthalar came to Athalantar at some point during the reign of King Belaur Aumar , having been sent by the king's brother Felodar as part of an effort to seize control of the realm. During his time in Athalantar, he survived at least three attacks by the Magelords. In the Year of the Chosen, 240 DR , presumably before the coup by Prince Elminster Aumar , Orthalar lured five Magelords to his house and trapped them all in the cellar, where he likely died with them.</p>
<p>However, there was no hard evidence he had died; the chance remained that he might have simply faked his death.</p>
