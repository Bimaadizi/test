<p>Colored Waters was a grand oasis and settlement in Anauroch . It was the home of the Mahwa tribe of the Bedine people.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was located in the region of Anauroch known as the Sword , just east of At'ar's Looking Glass .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The oasis was formed in a dormant caldera, set within a massive basin, covered in silt and ebony-ash, measuring 10 mi (16 km) long and 8 mi (13 km) wide. Within the center of the oases was a cylindrical spire of yellow-colored cinder.</p>
<p>Around the center of the oasis were five crescent-shaped lakes, each of a different and eye-catching color; ranging from green, turquoise, and blue, to even silver and red. The lakes were naturally warm, heated by the subterranean volcanic activity beneath the oasis.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The lakes were circled by a variety of flora, including salt-brush, golden grass, and even fig trees.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Sheikh Sa'ar led his people out of Colored Waters when Yhekal and the Zhentarim threatened their home. The sheikh's actions preserved the oasis and saved the Mahwa tribe from enslavement, or even destruction.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>According to Bedine legend, Colored Waters was the site where their deities defeated the forces of N'asr that originated from the Camp of the Dead , before the historic event referred to as the Scattering . It was said that when the gods died, the blood from their dead bodies colored the waters of the oasis' lakes.</p>
