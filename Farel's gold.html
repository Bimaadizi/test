<p>Farel's gold were enchanted golden sling bullets.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Farel's gold bullets were created out of gold and possessed two enchantments: upon collision they released acid, dealing additional damage, and had a coin-toss chance of affecting the target with the slow spell for twelve seconds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Farel's gold bullets were invented by Farel Harod of Amn during one of his lengthy expeditions into a deadly dungeon. He ran out of bullets and decided to use his gold coins instead, somehow he realized that he preferred them to regular bullets. After he escaped the perils of the dungeon he commissioned improved version of these expensive bullets. Since then, Farel's gold bullets have been appearing all over place, including the city of Neverwinter , Sword Coast , and the Moonsea .</p>
