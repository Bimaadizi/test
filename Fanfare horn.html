<p>Fanfare horns were long and elegant horns made of brass .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These instruments were long and conical with a simple design. The sound produced by fanfare horns was very strident and carried a heroic tone. For those reasons, their convenient shapes for bearing flags and their characteristic timbre made them the instruments of choice for state functions.</p>
<p>Fanfare horns were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue .</p>
