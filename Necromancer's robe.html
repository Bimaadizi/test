<p>The necromancer's robe was a unique enchanted robe that protected the wearer from death magic .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Despite its unassuming appearance, the necromancer's robe gave the wearer a chance to negate death magic spells tossed at them and offered protection from magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The necromancer's robe creator was a member of the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan who used the robe to protect himself during procurement of certain exotic items for the arcane research. However, necromancer's robe did little to save the wizard 's life when he made an enemy of a ranking member of the Plague Rats . Several years later, the robe was purchased from the Rats by Presio , an evil necromancer - priestess . In the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , Presio served marilith named Yxunomei who laired in the Dragon's Eye along with her forces. With Presio's death at the hands of the Heroes of Icewind Dale, the robe changed owners once again.</p>
