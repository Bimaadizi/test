<p>Jasper was a semi-precious form of quartz or chalcedony found in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mostly found in opaque shades of red, brown, or solid black, very rare specimens of these semi-precious stones were blue or had bands of blue superimposed over the other colors. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Jasper had strong anti- poison properties. Crushed to powder, it could be substituted for any solid ingredient when making antidotes or magical potions and items that neutralized poison or bestowed protection from poison. Because of its reputation and properties, jasper was the stone of choice for making both periapts of foul rotting and proof against poison .</p>
<p>If stored for at least 24 hours in a container made from jasper, consumable liquids were purified of all taint. This was standard practice in the royal palace in Suzail and many other courts.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Jasper was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station.</p>
<p>The lesser deity Vhaeraun was known to occasionally send black-hued jaspers to show his favour or disfavour to his followers.</p>
