<p>Maiden's milk was a common forest plant that possessed medicinal antitussive properties, found in the Wood of Sharp Teeth and the Western Heartlands .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Maiden's milk could be crushed and drank in a tea form to suppress cough by humanoids and dragons alike within minutes. Maiden's milk looked similar to another plant â€“ bellows root , that possessed emetic properties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , maiden's milk became a part of history when the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth was visited by a senile red dragon Craum Straug , whose dire caught lit the settlement ablaze. A traveling minstrel , Aznee Fraystrings , was tasked with removing the dragon and thought that he could prepare maiden's milk tea to help the wyrm like it did help his elderly uncle once. Aznee, however, made a mistake and made a bellows root tea instead, causing the dragon to vomit the tea out along with his draconic flame breath, incinerating the minstrel instantly. This vomiting fit eventually killed the geriatric dragon.</p>
