<p>The Cackling Chasm was a deep canyon found in Icewind Dale that was home to a vicious pack of gnolls in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The chasm had a feasting area where the gnolls fed, that was filled with bones of all manner of animals including elk , reindeer , and even other gnolls.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The chasm was located in the northern foothills of the Spine of the World mountains.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The gnolls were originally led to the chasm by the Fang of Yeenoghu , Chyzka . Unfortunately they arrived to the region during the Everlasting Rime and were found little opportunities to feed within the raging snows.</p>
<p>Some time during the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , the gnolls managed to capture and imprison a chardalyn berserker who wandered too far close to their den.</p>
<p>That same year, Chyzka and other gnolls managed to slay Nabira Moarskull of Easthaven , and recover her fishpole .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Speaker Trovus of Caer-Konig saw the gnolls of the Cackling Chasm as a grave threat to the people of his community. He was ready to place a bounty out for each gnoll head that was brought back to him.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>While many of the gnolls of the pack feared Chyzka, they hardly shared any loyalty for one another.</p>
