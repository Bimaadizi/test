<h2>History</h2>
<p>Baba Lysaga was the midwife for Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen , the mother of Strahd von Zarovich . She recognized Strahd's potential for evil and made sure that he would be able to cast spells . She found a ritual that would enable her immortality so she could see "her son" rise to greatness.</p>
<p>Some time after the Berez was flooded and fully abandoned, its ruins became a home to Baba Lysaga who later on lived in a hut in the middle of the village.</p>
<p>Circa Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Baba Lysaga with the help of the druids of Yester Hill stole a magic gemstone from the Wizards of Wines vineyard. She planned to use the gemstone as a bait for the wereravens protecting the vineyard.</p>

She was so obsessed with him, that she even used a programmed illusion spell to create an illusion of a wooden crib with a child she referred to as "Strahd" inside her hut.</p>
<p>Lysaga despised wereravens , who were often members of the secret Strahd resistance group called the Keepers of the Feather and made it her mission to wipe them out.</p>
