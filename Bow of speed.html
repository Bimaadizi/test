<p>Bows of speed were enchanted bows , popular among the thieves of Waterdeep circa 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Various bows of speed looked utterly mundane but possessed a set of handy enchantments. Apart from a +1 enchantment, the bow's magic also pulled undamaged and non-magical arrows to the wielder from within 108 feet (32.9 meters) around it. Once the bowstring was pulled back, a random arrow in the area teleported unto to the wielder's hand, ready to be shot. This enchantment allowed for a dramatically increased fire rate.</p>
<p>Some rare bows of speed were able to pull enchanted and magical arrows to the bowstring, as well as regular ones.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR, Shadow Thieves returned to Waterdeep, operating from a secret stronghold within Undermountain . Many of their higher-ranking members were armed with bows of speed , making them swift and dangerous opponents to the adventuring folk and the hero known as the Khelbenite .</p>
