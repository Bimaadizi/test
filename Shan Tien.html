<p>In Shou Year −120 (−1370 DR) , Tan Chin wielded Shan Tien when he fought the Black Leopard Cult at Durkon . There, with a sweep of Shan Tien , Tan Chin cut the Ivory Chain of Pao and freed the Black Leopard , who quickly seized the corrupt high priest Nan Kung Chi and dragged him screaming into the night, giving Tan Chin victory over the remaining cult.</p>
