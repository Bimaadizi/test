<p>Avorals were eagle-like guardinals that lived in Elysium and the House of Nature . Of all the guardinals, they were the most likely to leave their homeplane, as they possessed a strong wanderlust.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Avorals looked mostly humanoid, but possessed wings instead of arms, feathered bird-like legs, and feathers on their heads in place of hair. The wings did have a small hand at the midpoint, so that it could function as an arm when folded. Their keen eyes were bright golden. Avorals stood about 6 and a half feet to 7 ft (2.1 m) tall and had a 20 ft (6.1 m) wingspan, but due to their hollow bones only weighed about 120 lb (54,000 g). They could carry up to 300 lb (140,000 g) while flying.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The ruler of the avorals was Sathia , the Sky Duchess, but avorals were also known to serve Aerdrie Faenya and Mystra .</p>
