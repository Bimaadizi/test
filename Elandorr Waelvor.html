<p>Elandorr Waelvor was an inhabitant of Myth Drannor in the 3 rd century DR .</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>During an afternoon after the hunt of Elminster Aumar , Elandorr Waelvor was seen wearing a black velvet jerkin trimmed with a white motif of thunderbolts, a magenta-lined purple cloak, and gleaming boots to his thigh. He wore many rings, and carried his sword of honor in a jeweled scabbard.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a persistent suitor to Symrustar Auglamyr and a heir to house Waelvor .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During a revel, Elminster Aumar cast a spell that swapped the two of them out. Elminster was at the moment in the middle of a kiss with Symrustar Auglamyr, who had enspelled her kiss to ream his mind for anything of use to her magic. On arrival, Elandorr was given full access to her mind instead, and had her helpless at his mercy. Aware now of her plans to visit treacheries upon him, he visited upon her instead a punishment so brutal that he left her broken in both body and mind, though he planned for her death.</p>
<p>Some time afterwards, he picked a fight with Ithrythra Mornmist and Alaglossa Tornglara , speaking briefly about what he did to Symrustar.</p>
