<p>A drakkar ( pronounced : /ˈ d r æ k k ɑːr / DRÆK-kar ), also known as a dragonship , was the largest vessel used by the Northmen of the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typically 100 ft (30 m) long at the keel and 20 ft (6 m) wide, drakkars were primarily rowed, but could raise a single mast and sail if desired. The minimum crew size was 20, but it required 60 rowers to operate properly and could carry a maximum of 250 (including rowers). A fully loaded drakkar could not sustain quarters or supplies for that many crew and therefore was typically used for raiding on or near the coast. Its deep sea capabilities were dubious. A drakkar could be armed with a large weapon, such as a catapult or ballista , but was not built to wield a ram,</p>
<p>Drakkars were not commonly seen in the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
