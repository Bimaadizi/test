<p>Luthbaern ( pronounced : /ˈ l uː θ b ɛ ɑːr n / LOOTH-bearn or : / l ʌ θ ˈ b ɛ ɑːr n / luth-BEARN ) was a small town in the north-western Border Kingdoms in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The town was located on the Westwater Way, just to the northeast of the Barony of Blacksaddle and southwest of Felshroun . Luthbaern was a crowded town, filled buildings of slate and stone so close together there was barely any space for balconies between two buildings, and cobblestone streets. The town lacked any green space. Surrounding the town was lush farmland.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Luthbaernar merchants were notorious in the Border Kingdoms, with a reputation for being arrogant and pompous. The town was also known for its high quality goods. Farmers who lived around the town raised livestock such as cattle, goats and pigs. Tubers were a common food crop. Farmers also crafted Luthland cheese , a popular local cheese.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Defence of the town was provided by a Red Wizard of Thay , Izazrem Thal , who lived in the town in a form of self-exile from Thay . His wards cast around the town protected Luthbaern from brigands and raids. His wards prevented anything from flying over the town and also prevented illusions and shapeshifting. He has also casted a ward in which fire could only burn in designated areas, such at forges or inns. As a result, most Luthbaernar were unable to cook a warm meal at home.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Luthbaernar were hard workers but due to their poor eating habits, they tended be overweight. Each evening it was normal for a Luthbaernar to consume a large amount of meat and ale. And during the day, most Luthbaernar carried belt flagons and pouches of cheese, fried bread and sausages. Luthbaernar merchants wore lace at the collars and cuffs of their outfits, and usually wore rings with cantrips cast upon them so they glowed or flashed light.</p>
