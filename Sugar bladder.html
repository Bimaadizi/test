<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To make a sugar bladder, confections were wrapped inside of the pig bladder and then heated over a fire on a metal plate to dry out the package, at which point the bladder was tied shut and coated in tansel (a mixture of eggs and plants intended to provide an airtight seal). They were often packed in vegetable oil inside of tins that were then sealed with pitch , all to prevent spoilage.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Sugar bladders were commonly available from shops and restaurants in the Sword Coast and the Heartlands . They could be transported long distances by caravans owing to their relatively long shelf-life.</p>
