<p>Delban , also known as the Star of Ice and Hate , was a star-like Elder Evil from the Far Realm who had taken a place among stars of Realmspace . Unlike normal stars, Delban didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Delban was an ice white star.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Delban, like the other Far Realm-infested stars of Realmspace, was somehow related to the Eldest .</p>
<p>Delban was usually visible only in winter, but sometimes it shone without reason in any other seasons, surprising scholars who studied stars. Of all the Far Realm-infested stars, Delban was the most cruel and bitter.</p>
<p>Delban was one of the stars the warlock Japheth Donard sought out in 1396 DR , after having lost his pact with the archfey Neifion .</p>
<p>Sometime in the late 15 th century DR , a vestige of Delban's power had found its way into the domain of Barovia in the Shadowfell , where it offered pacts with creatures who approached it. To those few Delban bestowed the gift of controlling magical cold, giving them the ability to use the cone of cold spell up to seven times, as well as temporary resistance to magical cold and low temperatures. Even non- warlocks could be granted this ability from the star. Those who were granted the gifts of Delban, however, became terrified of fire .</p>
