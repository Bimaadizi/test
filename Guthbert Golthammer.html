<p>Guthbert Golthammer was the Zhent -appointed constable of Dagger Falls in the late 1360s DR , before the dale's liberation in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Guthbert was an ox-brained warrior but a member of both the Zhentarim and the Zhentilar . He started as a military commander of Teshwave , where he was circa 1356 DR , winning his position through the influence of his father, Elzund Golthammer .</p>
<p>Circa 1369 DR, Guthbert was the constable of Dagger Falls.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR, he was involved in the kidnapping of Randal Morn himself under orders of the Zhent wizard Ilthond . In the end, the situation went bad for the Zhentarim and the Freedom Riders attacked the town, defeating the Zhent soldiers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Guthbert was an amiable fellow, fearless in battle, but was very slow in thinking. Thus he usually had with him a more capable second-in-command, such as the cleric Asdag in Teshendale and the fighter Toren in Daggerdale.</p>
