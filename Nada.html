<p>In the Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , Nada was ordered by the local yakuza family to discourage an adventuring party hired by the daimyo , Benju Matsutomo . Calling himself Juto and contriving to bump into them in the street, Nada would idly tell the adventurers that bad karma would come to them if they continued their investigation. It was not meant as a threat, but as a helpful warning.</p>
