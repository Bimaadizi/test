<p>Sharlarion was one of the ancient elven cities founded long before the Crown Wars and even the First Sundering .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One of its founders was the master dragonrider Sharlario Moonflower . In the Year of Singing Sirens, a huge orc horde threatened the city. The orcs were led by the demon Haeshkarr . At that time most, High Magi of Sharlarion were dead and only the archmage Kethryllia Amarillis was left to lead the defenders. All others died in a magical backslash when they were bonded with the circle of High Magis in Occidian during the city's destruction. Besides being an archmage, Kethryllia was also a good fighter, and two nights before the attack began she even managed to complete a mighty magical sword , known as Dharasha . The second best defense of the city was at that time dragonriders , but they were away in the south to hunt down two black dragons . Only the archmage and the inhabitants could stand against the orc horde. But they managed to defeat them under heavy losses. Kethryllia even followed the demon into the Abyss . In doing this, she brought Faerûn to the attention of Lolth .</p>
