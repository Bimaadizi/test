<p>Manyboughs was a wood-crafted mansion located within the Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff , circa 1370 DR . Nestled on Mac Intyre Path , amongst a small grove of blueleaf trees, this home possessed an atmosphere and ambiance that lent to the residents the feeling they were living within a tree. In addition to its unique, natural atmosphere and decor, the manor of Manyboughs enjoyed a fantastic view of the Green from its east-facing entrance.</p>
<p>Built from magically enchanted wood, the structure of the Manyboughs house extended out as branches from one of three massive phandar trees. The limbs and boughs of the trees twisted up and around to form the sloped floors and walls and three-story manor. The water that flowed through this magical home was moved with magic .</p>
