<p>Sunset Hill was a thinly spread-out hamlet in Cormyr , built around a famously haunted hill of the same name.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The name "Sunset Hill" originated from beautifully golden hue sunsets that glistened and reflected off the haunted hill. The golden tingle was held on the hill's slopes long after the evening gloom swallowed the surroundings. One could think that a fortress could stand atop Sunset Hill; however, there was nothing but grazing sheep . At some point in its past, the hill was a location of gallows, long gone by the 14 th century DR . The hill's dark history was the reason for its famous or infamous hauntings. On an occasional night, ghostly apparitions of hanging bodies flickered into existence atop Sunset Hill.</p>
<p>The hamlet and its surroundings were lush grass-covered hills. Three large ponds were located at the namesake hill's base. The hamlet's cottages were scantly scattered across the ponds' shores and the hill's base. Sunset Hill could be called a settlement, but it lacked any form of government.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sunset Hill was located east of the small shepherd town of Bospir . Not far south of Masoner's Bridge across the Immerflow , just on the river's mouth on the Wyvernwater lake. The hamlet also was connected to the city of Immersea and the East Way through the Immer Trail .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Sunset Hill's shepherd believed that when its apparitions formed at night, any sheep still grazing in the area were cursed, transforming into monstrous beings with leathery wings known as dark horrors . These flying monsters were believed to attack and carry off straggling sheep and folk, only to transform back into normal sheep come the morning.</p>
