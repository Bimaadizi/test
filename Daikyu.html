<p>A daikyu ( pronounced : / d aɪ k j uː / digh-kyoo ) was a type of longbow . It was the largest variety of bow in use in Kara-Tur , but was rarely seen outside of that continent.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A daikyu was a large bow with a bottom grip. This allowed the bow to be easily fired from horseback or while kneeling. The bow was so large, at 7 ft (2.1 m) in length , that anyone under 4 ft (1.2 m) was unable to use it.</p>
