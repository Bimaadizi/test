<p>The Seven Sages were the appointed governors of the eight provinces of the Yikarian Empire in the World Pillar Mountains of northeast Zakhara in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These "sons and daughters" of the Faceless God were appointed by their deity. They ruled from their magnificent castles, commanding their own armies and answering only to their god and the Lotus Emperor in Nathong . As a group they were incredibly secretive, never using their real names. When visiting the other provinces they usually opted to fly atop giant rocs under the cover of darkness.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As vassals of their god and emperor, the Seven Sages were expected to tithe one fifth of their collected income to the Gate of Heaven each year. Those who failed to do so were quickly removed and executed in grisly fashion. Impalement and quartering were favored methods of execution.</p>
