<p>Stone biters were a type of arrow with heads specially designed for the purpose of attaching ropes to battlements, walls, or other structures. They required careful craftsmanship to produce.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Stone biters had narrow, heavy heads made of high-quality metal, with small ridges in place of the barbs one would find a wood biter arrow . They were usually sharpened to the greatest extent possible. Standard stone biters could provide a grip for relatively soft stone structures, such as those made of brick or sandstone , but those that used adamantine in their manufacture were capable of biting into all but the hardest of stone surfaces.</p>
