<p>Mistress Lissial was a heroic and fearless elf owner of the enchanted greatsword - Longbite .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime before 1372 DR , Lissial commissioned a magic blade modeled after the infamous Veiled Tears . She received the enchanted blade named the Gentle Rain created by one of Quilin 's apprentices. She wielded her powerful keen blade against a band of hill giants who ambushed the elf during her travels. Mistress Lissial knew she was outnumbered, but instead of fleeing, she charged at the giant leader, slashing his head clean off his shoulders, sending the rest hill giants to flee in terror. This encountered led to the greatsword being renamed as Longbite .</p>
