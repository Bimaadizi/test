<p>Forester was a gruff and proud man from Shadowdale that played an important role in the defense of his homeland during the second battle of Shadowdale during the late 1350s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was bear of a man with a disposition to match.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Forester was born in Shadowdale and spent his entire life living there, coming to know many of his neighbors and fellow Dalesfolk by name.</p>
<p>When the Zhentilar army occupied Daggerdale and threatened the rest of the Dales in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Forester was assigned to lead the all-important task of digging out ditches on the western side of the Ashaba Bridge . He quickly managed to get into a heated argument with the mortal adventurer Cyric , also assigned to the same work group, debating the merits of their assigned duties.</p>
<p>Cyric convinced Forester to keep true to their duty of helping defend Shadowdale. They helped groups of refugees make it safely across the bridge, and set up an ambush for the approaching Zhentilar army led by none other than Fzoul Chembryl . As the Zhen cavalry rode at the rear of the column approaching the west side crossing, Forester, Cyric and a few others leapt out from under the bridge and ambushed the first soldiers that set foot on it. The pair ran east across the bridge with reckless abandon, drawing the attention of the riders, while their fellow Dalesmen sabotaged the modifications they had made to the bridge, collapsing it just as the bulk of Zhent reinforcements were crossing.</p>
<p>After the Dalesmen's victory at the battle, Forester helped gather the bodies of the dead and identify them for considerations to their families. When he encountered a dying Zhent soldier, Forester slit his throat without remorse, apparently causing the ghost of its spirit to rise from the body. Forester froze in shock, especially after a cleric couldn't turn the apparition. The Zhent ghost was sent away by the defiant Cyric, who had known its presence was merely a by-product of the chaotic Time of Troubles , but remained appalled at Forester's ruthlessness all the same.</p>
<p>Forester would ultimately meet his own end a short time later when assigned for guard duty at the Twisted Tower of Ashaba . When Cyric broke into the tower to free his fellow adventurers Adon and Midnight , who had been wrongly accused of the death of Elminster Aumar . When the mercurial thief saw Forester, he used the Dalesman's trust to his advantage and plunged a dagger into his chest without a second thought, one step closer to freeing his former companions.</p>
