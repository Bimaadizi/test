<p>Thalorlyn , also referred to as the First Kingdom of Hmur or the First Thalorlyn , was a kingdom within the Aryselmalyr Empire beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars . It broke away during the Third Serôs War , passing itself off as independent, but was actually a puppet state of Aryselmalyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −1469 TS (−1539 DR) , the Aryselmalyr Empire ignites the Third Serôs War by lashing out against minor raids from aquatic ogres and koalinths . Four years later, in −1465 TS (−1535 DR) , merfolk within Thalorlyn began rebelling against Aryselmalyr over the oppressive violence that was occurring in the Third Serôs War.</p>
<p>Aryselmalyr's ruler, Coronal Essyl Merynth , secretly appropriates the rebellion by supporting a traitorous merfolk by the name of Kyron , who like him had succumbed to the maddening whispers of Dagon . With the Coronal's influence Kyron slowly rose to a position of leadership among the rebellious merfolk, all the while passing military secrets back to his benefactor.</p>
<p>Two years later, Thalorlyn itself to be independent and claimed the city of Myth Nantar for itself. Under the rule of King Kyron, the Dukars of Myth Nantar would suffer. Rebellions would slowly arise against Thalorlyn's new king. The Aryselmalyr Empire would viciously crack down on this, killing an estimated thirty percent of the merfolk in Serôs.</p>
<p>In −1461 TS (−1531 DR) , Coronal Essyl had an expedition dispatched to the mysterious Trench of Lopok . His agents would return to him later that same year with a trio of fiendish krakens , fellow servants of Dagon that were willing to ally themselves with the mad rulers, along with a powerful artifact that they forged called the Emerald Eye . Essyl would gift this artifact to Kyron so as to ensure the mad King's loyalty.</p>
<p>In −1455 TS (−1525 DR) the various merrows and koalinths of Serôs decided to combine their forces, forming the Horde of the Bloodtide , but this consolidated front continued to be no match against the combined forces of Aryselmalyr and Thalorlyn. That same year a group of spies discovered that the corrupt rulers' secret alliance with the krakens for further power. This revelation led to the formation of a rebel group known as the Republic of Tivaan . Despite the power of their kraken allies and the Emerald Eye , Tivaan managed to depose Kyron and his loyalists a year later, casting them out from the Hmur Plateau and becoming its successor state.</p>
