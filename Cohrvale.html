Cohrvale showed short fuse and demanded the adventurers to get out of his way. Bregg attempted to diffuse the situation, seeing how the adventurers were well-armed and Mr. F didn't like his men slaughtering people on the streets of Athkatla. Whether Abdel Adrian taunted Cohrvale and provoked him into battle, or avoided confrontation was unknown.</p>
