<p>Gokami was an early emperor of the island nation of Wa , whose actions triggered the Omi War .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Emperor of the Jade Throne Gokami ruled in the early second century of the Wa calendar . He was a member of the Goshukara line.</p>
<p>In Wa Year 138 ( −290 DR ), the ruler of Shou Lung sent a contingent of ambassadors to deliver the message that Shou Lung held Wa responsible for a rise in piracy in their waters. They demanded the fealty of the island of Wa as appeasement. Emperor Gokami was severely offended by the demand and the bold accusation against his nation. One of his advisors, Great Counselor of the Middle Nobunaga suggested the execution of all the ambassadors save for one. Gokami gave the order, the executions were performed, and the remaining emissary was sent back to Shou Lung without even a reply to deliver. This event is considered the beginning of the Omi War by most historians.</p>
