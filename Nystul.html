<p>Nystul ( pronounced : /ˈ n aɪ s t ʊl / NY-stul or pronounced : /ˈ n ɪ s t ʊl / NIS-tul ) was a human Oerthian mage , a master of disguise, and a member of the Circle of Eight , who showed fascination with magics that altered light and darkness and was responsible for the creation of many such spells .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Nystul's true appearance was hidden even from his fellow members of the Circle of Eight. At the age of forty-three years old, Nystul was a plain-looking, lanky man who weighed 184 pounds (83.5 kilograms), a noticeably lightweight for someone 6.583 feet (2.006 meters) tall. He had messy, lank hair of pale brown and brown eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nystul had a sharp and unerring mind but also was a lover of tactics, jokes, and puns. Using magic, Nystul often took on the guise of a fair elven maid when traveling, knowing that brave knights and stalwart paladins eagerly offered protection to such a delicate creature. He believed that a mage was never to meet an enemy in close combat, preferring greatly to control the battlefield with illusory magics.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nystul's group, which included Mordenkainen , Otto , Rary, Drawmij , Otiluke , Bigby , and Tenser , was known as the famed Circle of Eight.

At a later date, Nystul's Circle of Eight consisted of Warnes, Theodain, Alhamazad, Drawmij, Bigby, Nystul, Otto, and Jallarzi. Dwarf fighter from the Duchy of Tenh named Yars Blud-Sigul was Nystul's acquaintance and aided him against lich Vecna .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>

However, he was armed only with a simple dagger , which he seldomly used for anything but peeling an apple . Other wondrous items in Nystul's possession were boots of levitation , dust of disappearance , a hat of disguise , a helm of telepathy , a wand of enemy detection , a wand of illusion , and a wand of illumination . As an additional method of protection, Nystul was always under the effects of a permanent protection from evil spell.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nystul was born to a wealthy noble family in the capital city of the Duchy of Tenh. In later years, Nystul showed concern for his homeland and often felt others did not show enough concern for the Duchy of Ten.
