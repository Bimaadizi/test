<p>Evendur Olvebranch was a halfling expert and sage living in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was an inquisitive young woman of two diametrically opposed parts: on the one hand, prim and proper and orderly, and on the other, a chaotic whirlwind of activity, talk, and thought. She was excitable in conversation, asking lots more questions than necessary, and she forgot nothing. Not many could spend more than a few minutes in her company.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Evendur was a fast and knowledgeable researcher, but also quite expensive. For her services, circa 1372 DR , she charged 20 gp to answer a significant question, but could do so in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>She visited the Monastery of St. Ulrach occasionally to collect some special herbs that the monks there cultivated.</p>
