<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Eleint of the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , or within less than a month, Arroc, Rafim Cinder , and Glithander Ej-lahona became the three most recent additions to the famed Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff. Their acceptance into the guild was personally sponsored by the Old Sage, Elminster Aumar himself, who, at the time, visited the guild to address the looming planet threat to The Vast . All three new gamers were rumored to have elvish blood and to be originally from Elminster's home – the Dalelands . Arroc's acceptance into the guild and Elminster's visit were reported in the popular broadsheet – Ravens Bluff Trumpeter , by Nadd Parker , a freelance reporter.</p>
