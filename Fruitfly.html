<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fruitflies were round and resembled any of a number of fruits, such as apples , pears , mangos , oranges , with leaves that were actually wings.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fruitflies were swift fliers, quite hardy and difficult to surprise. However, they were quite limited in their options in battle, being unable to cause significant damage.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Fruitflies perished in the sunlight and were only known to exist in enchanted places such as the Pyramid of Amun-Re. Those who ingested a fruitfly had their strength bolstered, and their agility less so, for one hour.</p>
