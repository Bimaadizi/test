<p>Re was the former head of the Mulhorandi pantheon . As an ancient deity active in multiple crystal spheres he was known as Ra , while his manifestation sent to the Realms took the name Re.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Re died due to injuries he received during the Battle of the Gods by the orc deity Gruumsh during the Orcgate Wars . As Re died he transferred his power to Horus, who was from then known as Horus-Re . Before perishing, Re created hundreds of enchanted greataxes with his dying breath. These powerful magic weapons were especially deadly to orcs and their kin. Re's Redemption , as the axes later became known, helped to turn the tide of war.</p>
<p>During the Second Sundering , Re and other deities from the pantheon returned in the form of demigods and led the Mulhorandi uprising against the Imaskari , in a manner similar to how the Chosen manifested in other regions. As of 1489 DR , Mulhorand was led by the returned pantheon, who temporarily set their differences aside for the good of the Mulhorandi people.</p>
