<p>Ursa was a cave bear who lived in the Cloud Peaks area west of Nashkel in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of 1368 DR , a tribe of xvarts led by Nexlit considered Ursa their protectors. Were the xvarts ever attacked, they summoned the cave bear to their defense. However Ursa felt no particular kinship with the blue humanoids and was likely to gore them as much as it was to gore invaders or adventurers seeking to stop xvart cattle raids.</p>
