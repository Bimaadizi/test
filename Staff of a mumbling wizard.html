<p>The staff of a mumbling wizard an enchantment staff of dubious magics.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The staff of a mumbling wizard possessed an unreliable enchantment that allowed the wilder to cast the fireball or the firebolt spells at random. The random casting was the result of the staff being a creation of a compulsively mumbling mage whose words made it impossible for the weapon to differentiate between the two command words.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the staff of a mumbling wizard was displayed among splendorous enchanted rewards for those willing to partake in Akabi 's Wheel of Fortune game in the Circus of the Last Days during its stay in the Rivington neighborhood of Baldur's Gate .</p>
