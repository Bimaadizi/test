<p>Ladyrock was a small isle located in the mouth of the Fire River , and was counted among the neighborhoods of the Harbor District of Ravens Bluff . It was a favorite stop of rowdy and unsavory sailors to carouse and cut loose between voyages, thanks in part to the wide open view it had of any approaching City Watch patrols. To the more law-abiding Ravenians of the Bluff, Ladyrock island was a place they would often view, but seldom visit.</p>
<p>Access to the isle was available by a number of copper -a-ride ferries. The conveyances however were little more than a dinghy, or pair that had been bound together for slightly more stability.</p>
