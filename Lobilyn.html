<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Tarsakh 16 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , House Lobilyn's logging operation in Nunwood was interrupted. Most of the logging camp's guards â€“ Iron Lion Mercenary Band, were slaughtered by an army that claimed to be from Hlath's bitter competitor, the city of Reth . The takeover was to turn Hlath's and Reth's noble houses against each other and was secretly financed by a conspiring cabal of nobles in Arrabar .</p>
