<p>Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions was a collection of rambling essays by Mazfroth Gethur on a wide variety of scholarly topics.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book's cover was elegantly decorated with the title and Mazfroth's name in black ink. Far less care was afforded the actual contents of the book, however: most of the pages were hastily scribbled in the author's own handwriting, and his penmanship left much to be desired. Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions contained 151 pages, though several of these did not match, indicating that Mazfroth kept adding pages to the volume over time. The tome was 9 inches (0.23 meters) tall and 7 inches (0.18 meters) wide, and was rather poorly bound, lending Digressions a haphazard and worn appearance.</p>
<p>The essays contained within Digressions had no particular unifying theme, save for their apparent interest to the author:</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions was acquired by Amberdune Books , a book stall in Baldur's Gate which was secretly run by a pack of jackalweres . The Amberdune Pack had recently lost their leader, Nidalia , and sought to raise the funds to pay for a resurrection spell . The jackalweres had learned a ritual to create gingwatzims , shapechanging aberrations that could assume the forms of inanimate objects. They used this knowledge to create gingwatzim copies of their more valuable tomes, including Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Waterdhavian scholar Yalerion Highscroll purchased a gingwatzim copy of Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions , intending to use the book to pay for passage into the fortress library of Candlekeep . Yalerion's book was accepted by the Avowed , but before long the gingwatzim, requiring life energy for sustenance, began attacking other visitors to Candlekeep.</p>
