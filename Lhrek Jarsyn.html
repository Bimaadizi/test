<p>Lhrek Jarsyn was a mercenary and the leader of the Sailors of the Crimson Sea mercenary company based out of Airspur in Chessenta in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1350s DR, Lhrek and the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of Timindar in Chondath, having been hired by Lord Reland Tymin to confront the dark forces of Yrkhetep at Thurgabanteth . However, while passing the edge of the Chondalwood , they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Although the Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers, they were left with many wounded and dead, including their commander, Bendix . Lhrek became their acting commander.</p>
<p>After sending a messenger to Timindar, Lhrek, the mage Iurnan Chall , and other veteran members of the company went into the Chondalwood in search of more food. However, after killing a deer , cutting some branches, and starting a fire, they were captured by the druid Variath and his treants , who put them on trial. The treants demanded justice, accepting an apology and a compensation of 1000 gp . However, Lhrek refused, so Variath threatened execution. Adventurers sent from Timindar may have aided their trial; they were not executed and went on to Timindar.</p>
<p>Soon after, the Sailors fought in the Battle of Thurgabanteth.</p>
<p>After a brief political power struggle between Lhrek and Iurnan, by 1357 DR Lhrek had emerged as leader of the Sailors but he took Chall as his chief advisor and assistant.</p>
<p>They were active again in the early 1360s DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lhrek was normally an amiable young man, but the ambush, capture, and trial at the Chondalwood left him angry and frustrated, wondering if the local people were ungrateful for the Sailors coming to save them.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Lhrek fought with longsword +3 and wore chain mail .</p>
