<p>Garynor Ithal was the fourth king of Tethyr and the Ithal Dynasty .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Garynor was the first son of King Nishan Ithal . His twin sister was Rhynda Ithal . He was the father of at least one son , who shared his name.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Garynor was born in the Year of the Burning River, −159 DR . He acceded to the throne upon his father Nishan's death in −98 DR .</p>
<p>Most of King Garynor's reign seemed cursed under the cloak of Beshaba . Relations with the elves began to deteriorate, the clans did not support Garynor's twin sister Rhynda as court vizera, and piracy was on the rise. The tragedy continued when the king's son, Crown Prince Garynor II was murdered by a member of Clan Karlag , because the prince had been trying to establish a peace deal with the elves of Tethir .</p>
<p>King Garynor died unexpectedly in the Year of Leather Shields, −75 DR . Since he had no surviving male sons, the next in line to rule was his grandnephew, Nishan II , who had not yet come of age. For the next month, there was conflict as to who would rule in the interim. Despite great distrust of her among the clans, Vizera Rhynda began to rule as regent.</p>
