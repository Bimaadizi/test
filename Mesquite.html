<p>Mesquite was a type of tree found in the Forgotten Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mesquite trees had roots that could grow down over a 100 ft (30 m) into the earth, tapping into the deepest reaches of water. In desert regions, such as Anauroch, these extensive networks helped to stabilize sand dunes and hold them in place against the wind.</p>
