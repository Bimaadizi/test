<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>The man was sly-tongued.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was a Zhentarim . Aldluck Dreen served as his right-hand man. His two best slyblades were Taerach Thone and Blaeragh Ridranus . He was acquainted with the trader Aliphar Moongul and served by the mage Iyleth Loodrun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Calivar Murpeth was the ranking Zhentarim leader at the revel in Warmfires House in 1369 DR where they planned to murder Maervidal Iloster upon discovering he was an informer for the Harpers . He successfully poisoned the man (actually, Storm Silverhand in spell-guise) with saisha , a paralyzing poison, and then sent his two best slyblades after him as he left for the jakes.</p>
<p>The slyblades returned with an escort by the name of Talantha , after being unable to find the scribe at the jakes. They took the woman upstairs, where they prepared themselves to interrogate and torture her. Calivar first had a mageling, Iyleth Loodrun, try and sift her mind for what may be in there; he suffered deadly feedback, and died. He resorted to fully mundane interrogation afterwards. She fingered a number of them as people who forced her to assist in the scribe's escape; Calivar, in turn, took her at her word and had them killed, including Ridranus, before the escort revealed herself to be Storm Silverhand and then killed many of the remainder, including Calivar himself.</p>
