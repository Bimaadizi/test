<h2>History</h2>
<p>Christopher Riker , also known as Christopher Koart, was a champion of High King Cymrych Hugh when he triumphed over Kazgaroth in the 3 rd century DR . Christopher was made the Regent of Corwell after the High King established his new capital at Caer Callidyrr , and would pass that title on to his son, Cedric Riker .</p>
<p>Like the royal families of the Moonshaes, the Rikers adopted the name of Cymrych as they intermarried into that family. However, following the decline of the Cymrych dynasty in the 10 th century DR, the name of Riker reemerged.</p>
<p>By the midâ€“14 th century DR, the cantrev of Koart was ruled by lords of the Koart family. As of the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , the ruling Lord Koart also participated in the council that advised the Kendrick king at Caer Corwell .</p>
