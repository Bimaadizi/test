<p>Benante's Butchery was a small but renowned butcher shop in the enclave of Eileanar , owned and operated by the eponymous Benante .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Benante supplied fine meats to residents of Karsus within a 20-block radius, enjoying the financial support of his wife Acciajuoli that allowed him to pursue the highest quality without worrying about quantity. Cattle and sheep were slaughtered using a portal to the Negative Energy plane that painlessly drained their life force. After the carcasses hung and drained for three days, the priest Franchvail used her divine magics to bless and purify the meats of any parasites or diseases before it was cut to the customer's specifications.</p>
