<p>Suranatra was the first capital city of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra , later deserted and fallen into ruins. It lay among the southern foothills of the Akashnu Mountains .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ancient city of Suranatra was where the Kuong Kingdom first arose, founded by Vishnan I with it as his capital. From the outset, it was an aggressive and theocratic empire. Funded by the gems and precious metals of the Akashnu Mountains, the rich and puissant priest-kings of Suranatra expanded their dominion to the Kunong River and to the coast.</p>
<p>However, as the Kuong Kingdom expanded, it was forced to relocate its capital to Parmahana for administrative purposes. The people demolished part of the city, ironically to prevent its temples and holy sites from being desecrated after they left.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By the midâ€“14 th century DR , the jungle had reclaimed the ruins of Suranatra, though not as much as its successor, Parmahana. Wanderers and criminals used these ruins as a place to hide.</p>
