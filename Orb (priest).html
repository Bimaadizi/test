<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>An orb's primary mission was to recruit new followers for Iyachtu Xvim in order to increase his influence. They usually did this by orating charming speeches about Cyric 's failure and Xvim's resurgence. Anyone who failed to see the wisdom in following Xvim was confronted privately with threats.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Orbs were obsessed with finding and destroying the Cyrinishad to the point where it would take precedence over recruiting followers if an orb received any information about the book's whereabouts.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>

Their weapon of choice was the warhammer .</p>
