<p>Luranla Dreer was a human waitress at the Yawning Portal inn in Waterdeep in the early to late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She worked as the junior waitress and kitchen maid, though she would rather be known as a barmaid, and she sometimes worked the bar when the owner Durnan was out. She also made cheeses .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Luranla was an orphan from the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, who lived on the streets until Durnan hired her.</p>
<p>She was working at the Yawning Portal on the night of the Revel of Storms in the Year of the Weeping Moon, 1339 DR , when a patron, Yelver Toraunt , was murdered and the killer escaped. When a sailor got upset at hearing how Durnan disposed of bodies in the inn—by dropping them down a chute to be noisily devoured by a monster—Durnan quelled the man and Luranla served him a tankard of Black Sail and a complimentary seed-spiced cheese , mollifying him with her flirtatious charm. Durnan left her in charge of the bar when he departed with Mirt to investigate Yelver's death. Later, after meeting not one but two dragons in human form and learning of many more in the City of Splendors, Durnan and Mirt joked that Luranla too might be a dragon in disguise and Durnan feared to ask her.</p>
<p>She was still working at the Yawning Portal as of Eleint 30 in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , when Halaster's Call drew many adventurers to the Yawning Portal seeking access to Undermountain .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Glad to have a roof over her head, Luranla was determined to satisfy Durnan and his family in order to keep her job. She also tried to act tough and in control toward all the customers. She had a sharp-tongued manner but very flirty ways and was quick to get into a fight to settle any trouble.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Luranla had a beautiful full figure with distinctive black eyebrows and a great long mane of bright blue-black hair. Extensive dark tattoos covered her body, shoulders, and sides, so tangled that the distracted and confused the eye. Her voice was deep, described as smoky and husky. She commonly worked in only baggy breeches , boots , and an apron that was full-fronted but sleeveless so as to show off her tattoos. Sometimes she forwent the apron to show off rather more than her tattoos.</p>
