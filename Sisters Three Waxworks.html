<p>The Sisters Three Waxworks was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The Sisters Three Waxworks was a one-story building in fair to poor condition.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The shop's front room was dominated by candles of all shapes and sizes, arranged across every available surface. More unsettling were the lifelike wax statues of men and women placed upon shelves and pedestals, their blank expressions fostering rumors that they were, in fact, wax golems . It was whispered that these creations could animate should the sisters ever be threatened.</p>
<p>Beyond a beaded curtain was the workshop, where wax was melted and molded. This area contained an iron stove , cauldrons and pans , some filled with melted wax, alongside neatly stacked blocks of wax, bottles of scented extracts, dried herbs, braided wicks, and other tools of the trade.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Sisters Three Waxworks specialized in the manufacture of candles of various sizes, colors, and scents. Basic unscented tapers were sold at standard prices, but colored or scented varieties, beyond those derived from beeswax or rendered fat, were more expensive, reflecting their superior quality (average to high prices, excellent craftsmanship). Beyond candles, the shop created intricate wax effigies of people, animals, and arcane symbols, catering to both artistic and magical needs. Additionally, they sold an array of folk remedies, including herbal cures, tonics , balms , and elixirs made from a variety of natural ingredients such as herbs , crystals , and fungi .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Despite the shop's singular name, visitors were often surprised to discover that it was managed by three individuals, the identical sisters Kaitlynn , Briglynn , and Anithlynn . Each possessed a distinct personality and approach to their craft.</p>
