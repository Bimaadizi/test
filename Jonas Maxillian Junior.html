<p>Jonas Maxillian Junior was the son of Jonas Maxillian Senior and Gravia Maxillian , from the lineage of lycanthropes that stretched for several centuries. The werewolf family worked as apple farmers by day and sated their blood lust at night circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Jonas Maxillian Junior was an overeager and somewhat simple young man who looked a lot like his father, extremely muscular to almost freakish levels.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jonas Maxillian Junior was born to Jonas Maxillian Senior and Gravia Maxillian several years after Gravia was caught at night by a werewolf and turned, forcefully joining the Maxillian clan. The lycanthropes lived in the Maxillian Manor of the Western Farmlands of Daggerford , picking apples by day. Jonas Maxillian Junior was very much like his father and quickly accepted the family Malarite customs and creed.</p>
<p>In 1372 DR, the father and son were luring adventurers and travelers to partake in a "celebration." They offered the guests Gravia's hot apple cider , drugged with knockout drops . The victims were undressed and dropped within the Chase Maze, a maze underneath the Maxillian Manor, where they were chased and ripped apart by the bloodthirsty father and son. Gravia Maxillian never participated in these chases. She was merely a lesser werewolf and lacked the bloodlust and drive to chase and kill, which strained her relationship with her son and husband. Some of the victims were Pettywick Wocket , a gnome adventurer, and the Hero of Daggerford . Jonas Maxillian Junior chased the Hero through the maze, but the adventurer managed to retrieve the equipment and slay both werebeasts.</p>
<p>Gravia Maxillian mourned her son but held no grudge against the killer of her family. The Hero helped her find a new and safe home with the Church of Selûne .</p>
