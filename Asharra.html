<p>Asharra ( pronounced : / ɑː ˈ ʃ ɑːr ɑː / ah-SHAR-ah ), or Teacher , as she was known by her own kind, was an elderly aarakocra druid , as well the leader of Kir Sabal near the end of the 15 th century DR . She was venerated by the others in her community, to the point of being considered sacred.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Asharra was exceptionally insightful and equally ambitious. While she had a propensity for manipulating others, she never acted in a manner that was malicious or uncaring.</p>
<p>She knew the specifications of a ritual called the Dance of the Seven Winds , that allowed a small number of people to temporarily gain the power of flight.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Asharra owned a collection of 44 books , all of which were published before the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR . They covered a variety of subjects including mathematics, geography , and philosophy, among others.</p>
<p>Asharra owned several staves of distinct designs. A simple driftwood staff , decorated with intricate carvings, an aarakocra battle staff often used in battle and ceremonial arms by the aarakocra royal guards, a staff carved out of suth decorated with colorful feathers, cloth, and jewelry. Enchanted staves of hers were: a warstaff of the Wind Dukes and a staff of the magi . She was often armed with daggers , such as a simple carving knife, a dark zalantar -hafted blade with a black blade dipped in ink , a shiv crafted out of a velociraptor fang, a magical runic blade of Aaqa , and the Dance Blade of the Seven Winds used in the Dance of the Seven Winds ritual.</p>
<p>Her collection of robes included an elder's raiment , purely ceremonial vestment of aarakocra elders, a battle mage tunic that offered some defense in combat, an enchanted set of prestigious chromatic vestments , and the powerful ceremonial garments of the Black Orchid . Asharra used magical amulets to enhance her spellcasting abilities. Such amulets included a simple copper cain, a citrine pendant, an intricately weaved silver string dreamcatcher that protected her from nightmares and curses , an enchanted sapphire pendant of mage armor , and a powerful item, the glorious diamond necklace of the airborne .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her needs were seen to by an elderly servant named Yingmatona , who aside from Prince Na, was the only individual allowed within her home.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the aarakocra of Kir Sabal sheltered the current heirs of the royal family of Omu , Prince Na and Princess Mwaxanaré . While Asharra stated their actions were altruistic in nature, she held some aspirations of uplifting the aarakocra to a higher social standing in Chult. She sheltered the young royals and raised them with an sense of entitlement and skewed perspective of their royal authority within greater Faerûn .</p>
