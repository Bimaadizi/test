<p>The Dome of the Rose was a monastery and temple to Lathander in the Gem District of Athkatla . It was a slender, elegantly designed building that possessed a simple grace that was not typical of its surroundings.</p>
<p>The temple was run by a Mornmaster , who was aided by eight clerics . The clergy maintained the holy site as an oasis of austere serenity amid the flurry of commerce and activity within the rest of the city. It served as a haven where the faithful of Lathander could rest, meditate and worship in peace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dome of the Rose was a three-story temple hall, capped with a dome of rose-tinted glass which glowed at dawn during the morning song and prayer services, whose windows were all facing east. Outside the temple proper was a garden and orchard which were encircled by an outer wall.</p>
<p>Visitors were allowed in to the temple through the west and north entrances, while monks entered via the gardens in the east and south.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>While the temple granted Athkatlan Lathanderites a haven to pray and find solace, only pilgrims from far off lands and high-ranking priests and priestesses of the Morning Lord who were staying in the city less than a month were given room and board within the Dome of the Rose .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>In the mid-14 th cenutry DR , Mornmaster Thaddin Dawnhunter was the leading priest at the temple. He was a quiet, pious priest with little trade-sense. He was aided by the shrewd, former- pirate , Brother Haladso and Sister Moraeda Dawnduth , who was said to be "touch by the god" by the Lathanderite clergy who raised her as an orphan.</p>
