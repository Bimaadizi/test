<p>Kuragolomsh was a destrachan settlement located within the middle Deep Wastes .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Kuragolomsh was found beneath the Earthspur Mountains in the far eastern part of the Deep Wastes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The destrachans of Kuragolomsh lived in holes in the side of a tunnel. The tunnel that composed the thorp was 320 feet (98 meters) in length and 15 feet (4.6 meters) in width. One end of the tunnel opened up into a wide cavern, which was used as an amphitheater.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Kuragolomsh was ruled by Ooorooee, the largest and strongest destrachan of the thorp. His destrachan name was unknown, he was called Ooorooee by the patrols who have heard his loud roars. He has several mates and rules Kuragolomsh with great pettiness and spite.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Universally despised by other sentient being, the destrachans were the sole inhabitants of Kuragolomsh. At any given time, between fifty and eighty destrachans were present within the thorp. The thorp frequently sent out hunting parties of between ten to twenty individuals, their target unknown. Upon returning, they brought back only prisoners, usually gnomes or humans , who were brutally tortured before being killed.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>Several drow outposts were found near Kuragolomsh. The lords of these outposts have considered several time to destroy or drive out the destrachans but always abandoned such ideas, fearing a brutal counter-attack. Instead, the drow lords used the thorp as a trap, driving or luring their enemies towards the destrachans.</p>
