<p>Orbech was a Chondathan logging settlement located on the edge of Satyrwood , between its sister town of Timindar and the Fields of Nun .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Orbech was founded in the Year of Sunless Stones, 260 DR , as a frontier town on the border of Chondalwood along with Timindar. Soon after, the Grand Druid of the Gulthmere Forest , Ariton Maliwick , issued a stern warning over the desecration of Chondalwood. The first warning, along with several more that followed, were ignored by the Illistine ruling family of Chondath.</p>
<p>In the Year of Bane's Shadow, 267 DR , Orbech and Timindar were destroyed in the Battle of Fallen Trees . The short but deadly war was waged by the elves of Chondalwood and the Emerald Enclave as retaliation for logging. A few inhabitants of Orbech survived and fled to the city of Shamph , bearing a dire message from the elves: "Advance no further into our homeland." In response, Chondath assembled an army of 10,000 and marched into the Chondalwood in retaliation for the massacre. The following battle became known as the Crushed Helm Massacre of Chondath.</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , only a few stone structures remained among the rubble as a grim monument to the conflicts of the past. Most folk chose to avoid the destroyed village apart from some reckless adventurers, and most of the ruins were picked clean by years of scavengers. The ruins were rumored to be haunted, with local sages knowing that the ghost stories were more than just tall tales.</p>
