<p>Kartaklys was a Netherese archwizard .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 2884 NY (−975 DR) , this archwizard began to create his own flying enclave , and started the crucial stage of shaving off the top of a mountain. It was believed that a rival archwizard, Buoyance , interrupted Kartaklys' plans by casting trap the soul on him. Kartaklys, his life-force trapped, was unable to react as the mountain top fell atop him, ending his life.</p>
