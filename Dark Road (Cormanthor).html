<p>The Dark Road was a forest route in the Dalelands leading from Ashabenford in Mistledale to Essembra in Battledale .</p>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>The road was named for the extensive shroud of trees shading its path. It was also associated with the ominous fate awaiting non- elves who ventured into the Vale of Lost Voices . Drow elves also had to be careful on this road.</p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>The road started in the area around Ashabenford, cut through Cormanthor , and meandered to Essembra, passing the Vale of Lost Voices.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Dark Road originally served as a simple pathway for elves from Cormanthor and the Tangled Vale to reach the heart of the Vale of Lost Voices, during the vale's early years.</p>
<p>In the period after the Opening of Myth Drannor , the road gradually broadened as a natural result of regular usage.</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , those on a journey were strongly advised to steer clear of this little-traveled path, as it led to the age-old burial sites of elves where travelers could accidentally stumble upon elven ghosts and banshees threatening to kill all non-elven intruders. The Dark Road ends were also protected by baelnorn guards dissuading everyone except funeral processions from accessing the sacred place.</p>
