<p>Tchandrae Euinwood was a girl with strange powers in Kheldell in 1370 DR .</p>
<p>She possessed unusual powers: simply by touching an item, Tchandarae would know things about it, similarly to the legend lore spell. She was examined by Elminster Aumar in person, who said her powers had no clear origin but he was sure she was blessed by Mystra .</p>
