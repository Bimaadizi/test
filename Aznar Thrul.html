<p>Aznar Thrul , Zulkir of Evocation and Tharchion of the Priador , was one of the eight rulers of Thay and its Red Wizards .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>An exceedingly cruel and evil man, he was the greatest rival of the lich Szass Tam , Zulkir of Necromancy .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Thrul was originally trained in the Art at Blackstaff Tower by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun . By the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , he had his own apprentice: Mantorra Hennaflame .</p>
<p>Ibbalar Thrul , a Red Mage of Thay and one of the apprentices of Halaster Blackcloak from mid-14 th century DR, was likely Aznar's relative.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Salamander War , Thrul bargained with Kossuth , god of fire, to aid the Red Wizards. Their victory led to the capture of the Priador and the appointing of Thrul as its tharchion. This led to a close alliance between Thrul and Mythalanir , high priest of Kossuth's Flaming Brazier temple.</p>
<p>Aznar was credited with rediscovering the ancient Mulhorandi secrets for creating gemstone golems in 1368 DR , and set about building an army with which to conquer Rashemen . However, he underestimated how difficult it was to control these constructs. By 1372 DR , they were largely no longer under his control, and had spread out across the continent. His personal army also included the Sisters of Cyric , a regiment of Cyricist priestesses who rode into battle on black unicorns .</p>
<p>In the wake of becoming the tharchion of Priador, Aznar Thrul captured the former tharchion Mari Agneh and kept her as his slave and sexual play-thing. In 1375 DR , Mari was transformed by the blood fiend Tsagoth into his likeness and finally killed Thrul.</p>
<p>Aznar Thrul's position as Zulkir of Evocation remained filled for a time.</p>
