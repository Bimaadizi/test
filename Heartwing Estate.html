<p>Heartwing Estate was an estate and pegasus farm on the east bank of the Winding Water in the Western Heartlands , near Boareskyr Bridge .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The estate was located upstream and due north of Boareskyr Bridge, and so was unaffected by the poison afflicting the Winding Water after Cyric killed Bhaal on the Bridge during the Time of Troubles . The village of Serpent's Cowl lay nearby.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Heartwing was considered a small estate.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The wizard Aluena Halacanter raised pegasi on the estate; these could be purchased for 5,000 gp per steed. Potential customers were vetted through a series of ( magically assisted) examinations and interviews to ensure they would make capable owners. The sales contract included a clause stating that if a pegasus was maltreated and returned to Heartwing, no refund would be given.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The first generation of pegasi raised on the estate was spawned from a clutch of eggs Aluena rescued from the nearby Serpent Hills , where pegasus nests were often raided by reptilian predators.</p>
