<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The only significant industry in Ongul's Water was a gristmill run by Durkin , a descendant of the namesake founder Ongul .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The people of Ongul's Water primarily grew vegetables and raised ducks. Some of the braver ones hunted game in Hermit's Wood, or hired themselves out as guides to visitors despite the fact that the "guides" actually knew very little about the forest itself.</p>
