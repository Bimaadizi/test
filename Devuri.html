<p>Devuri was a crayfish hengeyokai shukenja and priest of the Lords of Creation in the town of Kataburi in the Kuong Kingdom in the midâ€“14 th century DR . He was previously an adventurer.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Circa 1357 DR , Devuri led the town's temple to a local river spirit, who was believed to bless Kataburi with its giant crayfish . He had many contacts with fellow water-dwelling creatures of the river.</p>
<p>Some, such as the old nun Ama , didn't like that Devuri was employed as a priest and thought he wasted too much of his time in the river, but this was likely prejudice.</p>
