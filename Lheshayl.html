<p>Lheshayl was a small city in the Shining Plains that prided itself on its cavalry and horse export.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city sat on the southwestern side of the Shining Plains and was the only city on the west side. The city was connected by the Tethyr Road that stretched through the Shining Plains from Lheshayl to Murann and eventually, reached Alaghôn , Turmish . Rushing Hills laid to he the south-west of Lheshayl.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>A long line of chiefs ruled Lheshayl, and in 1372 DR , the city was led by Chief Entawanata . Assam was governed by a ruling council that consisted of representatives from Lheshayl and Ormath . Lheshayl had aspirations for sole control. However, it took no actions that could anger Ormath. Assam's judiciary system was also governed by Lheshayl and Ormath, who assigned the city's judges.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The small city produced high-quality horses - the Plainsteeds , much finer than those from Ormath and Assam put together. The quality and numbers of Plainsteeds earned Lheshayl the title of the equestrian capital of the Reach. Lheshayl maintained a trade realtionship with a lizardfolk city of Surkh , as well as Riatavin and Saradush to the east.</p>
<p>Agriculture was a small industry in Lheshayl, limited to several farms that grew wheat and rice .</p>
<p>Hunting was a popular pastime in Lheshayl, attracting ambitious hunters from other regions during its many "official" hunting seasons, enforced by the Emerald Enclave . The hunting seasons usually were scheduled for late summer and autumn with an emphasis on Eleint , Marpenoth , and Uktar . Occasionally, depending on the winter, spring hunting seasons were announced to cull the population of herd animals. Individuals who violated the hunting seasons were themselves hunted by the local druids and non-human tribes of the Shining Plains.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Following the battle on the Field of Tears , Chiefs of Lheshayl attended the annual commiserating crimony that took place on the Hill of Memories .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Lheshayl was protected by a sizable cavalry known as Riders, the biggest cavalry of the region with Sespech being the second largest. Even though Lheshayl's Riders were proud and well-trained cavalry, they showed vulnerability when forced to battle on foot.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Year of the Lost Library, 150 DR was the beginning of the period of the history of the Vilhon Reach called the Calmwaters , for the economic growth and lack of any disasters or wars. During the Calmwaters, Lheshayl grew in size, becoming the center of civilization and trade in the Shining Plains. The export of horses from the Shining Plains began with supplying a mercenary army stationed in Ormath.</p>
<p>From 230 to 239 DR , King Dalagar "Longwalker" of Andlath supervised construction of the Tethir Road that blessed Lheshayl with trade connections to Turmish, Athkatla , Ormath, Murann and other centers of trade.</p>
<p>In the Year of Secret Slaughters, 326 DR a dispute between grazing rights between Ormath and Lheshayl escalated. Twenty-five thousand men - the armies of the two city-states fought a vicious battle for over a week on the Field of Tears too, but before it could be concluded, the wemics of the Tenpaw tribe attacked and drove both armies from the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Year of the Fanged Beast, 640 DR brought a series of attacks by an increased population of saber-toothed tiger . The citizens of Ormath and Lheshayl and patrols of the Shining Plains were the targets. These deadly attacks completely devastated several trade caravans, and entire patrol parties were gone without a trace. The tiger attacks were stopped by the mercenary companies of the Shining Plains, securing profitable trade with Hlondeth .</p>
<p>The Rage of Dragons of the Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR served a blow to the city of Lheshayl. The flight destroyed many of the city's structures with its inhabitants hiding in the basements of their torched homes all through the summer of that year.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , Lheshayl attempted to drive the thri-kreen Krakk't tribe from the Rushing Hills to the south-east from the city. They planned to cut thri-kreen's food supply by stopping animals from wandering into the Rushing Hills. This only caused the Krakk't thri-kreen to start attacking caravans that traveled through the northern parts of the Hills. Eventually, Lheshayl adopted a semi-official policy to make sure to drive animals into the Rushing Hills to avoid further attacks.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Lheshayl became plagued by horse thefts and slaver abductions. Travelers who fell victim to the slavers were sold off in the city of Nimpeth . The Chief was more concerned with horse-stealings and cared little for the abductions.</p>
