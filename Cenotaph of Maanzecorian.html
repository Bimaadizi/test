<p>The Cenotaph of Maanzecorian was a small shrine dedicated to the mind flayer deity Maanzecorian , who embodied complete knowledge and comprehension. The Cenotaph was located on the western edge of the Undervaults of Ilsensine in the illithid city of Oryndoll . The Cenotaph was home to the Cult of the Philosoflayer, who were a minor part of the Venerator Creed .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The shrine was constructed of jet, jade, ivory, and marble and the hides of many creatures were put on display. The chambers of the shrine were richly furnished, and the shrine itself was dome-like in shape. At the zenith of each dome, Maanzecorian's holy symbol was inscribedâ€”a silver crown set with a red gem.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Cult of the Philosoflayer was active until Maanzecorian was killed by Tenebrous , the undead remnant of the demon lord Orcus . The Elder Concord of Oryndoll did its best to save what they could from Maanzecorian's realm of Gehenna , but in the end the Cenotaph was left to fall into ruin.</p>
<p>Maanzecorian returned during the Second Sundering in the 1480s DR and resumed its prior position across many temples in the realms, though it is unknown if this temple was also refurbished.</p>
