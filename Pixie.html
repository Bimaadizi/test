<p>Pixies were a race of fey sprites .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pixies resembled tiny elves, with reports placing them variously at 2.5 feet (0.76 meters) to as little as 1 foot (0.3 meters) in height. Pixies had silvery, moth-like wings and preferred to wear brightly colored clothing.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pixies were mischievous sprites that enjoyed playing pranks on people. Such pranks included leading travelers astray and tricking misers into parting with their wealth.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Pixies had a number of innate magical abilities, such as being naturally invisible. At will, they could replicate the spells polymorph self , know alignment , dispel magic , dancing lights , and ESP . Once per day, they could turn invisible for as long as they desired, cause confusion at a touch, and create an illusion with both visual and audible components; this illusion would remain until dispelled. Some pixies could replicate the spell Otto's irresistible dance once a day.</p>
<p>In combat, pixies wielded appropriately sized swords and bows. Their arrows were sometimes drugged with a potion that caused complete memory loss.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Pixie villages each had different clans or families in it; community loyalty was very important to pixies.</p>
<p>Although pixies carried no treasure with them, they were known to have tiny hoards in their homes in order to impress visitors.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Pixies were active at nighttime. They were herbivorous, eating fruit and nectar.</p>

<p>In the Unapproachable East , pixies could be found around the woodlands of Aglarond . Including the grassy meadow known as Halendos .</p>
<p>Beyond the Prime Material plane , some pixies could be found in the realm of Faerie and the Elemental Plane of Air .</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
