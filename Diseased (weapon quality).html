<p>Diseased was an enchantment that caused a weapon to inflict a wasting disease .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Anyone who received an injury from a diseased weapon was at risk of instantly contracting filth fever , and manifesting symptoms without any incubation period. The disease itself was not magical , so the afflicted creature could recover from it naturally.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
