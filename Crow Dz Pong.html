<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Crow Dz Pong terrorized the coast of western Koryo, from Pyong Do to south of the Ziyero Ridge . His pirates assaulted shipping through the Straits of Koryo ; survivors reported seeing him run across the water to their ship as water elementals emerged before their bow.</p>

<p>Crow Dz Pong typically wore robes deep blue in color, with a heavy hood and boots black as coal, both trimmed in sky-blue ki-rin fur. At his throat, he wore a pendant with an aquamarine the size of a chicken's egg. His mustaches were braided and long enough to reach his chest; a jewel was tied to the end of each.</p>
