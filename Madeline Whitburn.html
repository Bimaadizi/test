<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lord "Whit" Whitburn faced with the lack of "stiffness" in the bedrooms and Madeline purchased a remedy through her butler, Blathers . However, Rigid-Quik Cordial proved to be ineffective when mixed with a glass of Lord's evening sherry . Lady Whitburn wrote an angry letter of complaint regarding the cordial and demanded her money back or an alternative solution to the soft problem of her husband's.</p>
<p>When the Absolute crisis hit Baldur's Gate, the city's new Lord, Enver Gortash , secretly behind the strife, was given names of eight members of the Parliament of Peers who were susceptible to influence. According to the Black Hand of Loyalty 's research, Lady Madeline Whitburn was one of the nobles who would easily fall in line with the cult via bribery, blackmail, or direct threats.</p>
