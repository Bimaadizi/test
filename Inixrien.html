<p>Inixrien , the Tenth City of the Sword , was one of the twelve major cities in the imperial heartlands of ancient Jhaamdath during the Founding Time .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Tenth City was far east of the capital Naarkolyth on the south side of the Bay of Jhaamdath . After its destruction, the ruins lay in the Selmal Basin in the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Inixrien was founded in −4620 DR , as the tenth of the realm's Cities of the Sword.</p>
<p>By −1504 DR , the empire's long-running struggle with Unther led to the Untheric conquest of the Akanal region and Jhaamdath being invaded directly. Inixrien was attacked, and despite the defense by the heroic Hlath the city was taken, with much of eastern Jhaamdath taken by −1499 DR . This conquest was held until −1069 DR , when Jhaamdath's counter-conquest reclaimed much of what had been lost.</p>
<p>In the year of −276 DR , Jhamdaath began a campaign of regional expansion that led to a brutal war with the elves of Nikerymath . In response, the −255 DR saw the elves use a High Magic ritual to destroy the heartlands of Jhaamdath with a great wave from the Inner Sea . The massive movement of water created the Vilhon Reach and sank Inixrien like the rest of the realm, and its psionic artifacts were buried in the sea floor where their emanations affected the nearby sealife.</p>
<p>Sunken Jhaamdath was later revealed by the dropping of sea levels after the Spellplague in 1385 DR , becoming the Vilhon Wilds . The lands and ruins were once again submerged in 1486 DR by the Great Rain and Second Sundering .</p>
