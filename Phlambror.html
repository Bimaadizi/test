<p>Phlambror was a wealthy merchant, investor, and business owner in Kh么ltar , the Iron City. He was also a notorious philanderer and was eventually killed by a jealous husband.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Phlambror was tall and exceedingly handsome.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was very sophisticated, a friend to many, kind to others, and charitable to the destitute regardless of race or occupation.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Phlambror had many investments in businesses around town and was the sole owner of a tavern called The Hand of Welcome located on Orntathtar Way next to Taurgaur's Tarjteir near Handrornlar, the northern gate through the walls surrounding the Iron City.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Phlambror was an astute businessman with a weakness for women and he was equally good at negotiations for business or pleasure. His womanizing finally caught up to him when a cuckolded husband killed him in a jealous rage. Even though the murdering spouse was arrested standing over Phlambror's body and covered in his blood, the man was never prosecuted because at least four hundred other men with wives and daughters turned themselves in, claiming to have done the deed. The garthraun (police) had no choice but to dismiss the crime as justified.</p>
<p>Phlambror had never married and had no known heirs or kin, so the reading of his will before the Belarkh (ruling lord) was of concern to many of his debtors. To the surprise of all, he nullified all debts owed him and all his stakes in businesses reverted back to their owners. His many properties were bequeathed to various citizens and, in particular, his tavern was donated to three dwarves that were regular customers whenever they came to town. The three promptly retired from their other businesses, renamed the tavern Phlambror's in his honor, and made it a "home away from home" for Great Rift dwarves that came through Kh么ltar.</p>
