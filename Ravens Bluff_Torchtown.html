<p>Torchtown , formerly known as Urngaff , was a neighborhood in the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff that was absent the usual landmarks and gaudy storefronts of other parts of the city, but housed a great number of independent, guildless and even illicit craftspeople and tradespeople. While it was home to some of the city's more colorful citizens, many of whom worked and frequented the nearby marketplace , unless someone lived in this neighborhood they very likely could forget about its existence.</p>
<h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>The neighborhood's early name of Urngaff came from an old Ravenian pirate who met an untimely and bloody death in the early years of the city. Its later name, Torchtown, was a nod to the many torches and lanterns that provided illumination for the vendors who were allowed to sell their wares through all hours of the night.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After the influx of former tent-dwelling merchants from outside the city, a number of small stands and vendor booths were set up, and since abandoned in Torchtown. These were since rebuilt into small-scale cottages that were perfect for the halfling , and even half-elf residents of the Bluff looking for more cozier accommodations.</p>
<p>The northern half of Torchtown served as home to the independent and guildless crafters as well as the professional counterfeiters of Ravens Bluff. Visitors could procure copies of books, or near-exact duplications of exquisite valuables. The local guards tended to turn a blind eye to these activities, allowing them to practice their trade.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Unlike the other locales of Ravens Bluff, Torchtown didn't become more expansive during the latter 14 th century DR , but rather more diverse. After the tent city that had formed outside the northern city gate disbanded, its vendors, performers and merchants made their way into the abandoned Market District, bringing throngs of gawkers and legitimate customers alike.</p>
