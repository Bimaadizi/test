<p>Kumiss or koumiss ( pronounced : /ˈ k uː m ɪ s / KOO-miss ) was an alcoholic beverage made from soured or fermented mare 's milk that was common in the Hordelands and Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kumiss was either sour or bitter, but either way it was an acquired taste. It was thin with a curdled yellow-white color. It smelled of curdled milk. Hordelands kumiss was considered only mildly alcoholic whereas Zakharan koumiss was known to be very potent. The lama Koja said it warmed the blood and purged cooling humors; though he struggled to even tolerate it, he eventually developed a liking for it.</p>
<p>Among the Tuigan, "black" kumiss was made from the milk of the khahan's own mares. It was considered to be the highest quality.</p>
<p>In the Hordelands, it was stored in leather skin bags and drunk from cups or bowls or direct from a serving ladle.</p>

<p>In Zakhara, koumiss was drunk in various drinking establishments and served with evening meals but it was forbidden in areas controlled by moralists such as the Pantheist League .</p>

<h2>Significance</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR , after the Grand Army of the Tuigan invaded Thesk and were opposed by the Army of the Alliance , King Azoun IV sent two emissaries to Yamun Khahan. They were offered kumiss, but a Theskan soldier named Kyrok feared it was poison and refused to drink. Yamun and his generals were angered at this disrespect of their customs and insult to the khahan, and had him beheaded immediately. In a later meeting, Azoun drank kumiss—from the skull of Abatai , a former enemy of Yamun—and conducted their meeting.</p>
