<p>Dancing monkey fruit was a variety of magical fruit that could be found in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fruit and its juice were poisonous . The most notable effect of this poison was that it could cause humanoids to immediately begin moving around in what looked like a comical dance. An afflicted individual was unable to perform any movements save for this forced "dance", which could last up to a minute without any intervention. Even after the dancing subsided, the ingested fruit left afflicted individuals feeling sick for an hour.</p>
<p>Each fruit contained enough juice to fill a vial .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Dancing monkey fruit was found in the Chultan wilderness, although it was rare. It grew on trees, with each tree usually bearing as many as a dozen fruits at a time. Flying monkeys were known to sit in such trees and throw the fruit at explorers in the jungle.</p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>Dancing monkey fruit could be used to make dyes for textiles , and was used at the dye works in Port Nyanzaru 's Market Ward .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dancing monkey fruit trees were grown in the gardens of Nangalore .</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the sale of dancing monkey fruit in Port Nyanzaru (along with the sale of any other fruits in that city) was presided over by the merchant prince Kwayothé . Any dancing monkey fruit sold without her oversight was considered to be contraband, and buying such fruit (or using it to produce dyes) could see a person sentenced to Executioner's Run by Kwayothé and the Ytepka Society .</p>
