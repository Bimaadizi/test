<p>Duneth Wharreil was a drow and the former archmage of Maerimydra until his coup during Lolth's Silence and his subsequent death at the hands of Irae T'sarran . As of 1372 DR he persisted as a silveraith under Irae T'sarran's control.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth barely resembled his previous self. He appeared as a vaguely skeletal being wrapped in wisps of glowing blue energy that trailed around him much like a wizard's robe.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Since his transformation into a silveraith, Duneth eschewed most material possessions. However it was known that in life he possessed a staff of frost , which was taken by Irae T'sarran.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Duneth Wharreil was the archmage of Maerimydra up until the Silence of Lolth struck the Maerimydrian priesthood. Then Duneth hatched a plan to remove the Lolthites and rise to power himself by forging an alliance with the half-fiend /half fire giant , Kurgoth Hellspawn , to invade the city.</p>
<p>Whilst his plan came to fruition and the city fell to their combined forces, he was struck by the aspiring church of Kiaransalee . The priestess Irae T'sarran destroyed the archmage and threw down his tower, turning the wizard himself into an undead creature known as a silveraith in 1372 DR . Duneth was rendered a mere tool of Irae, pitted against any threats she perceived.</p>
