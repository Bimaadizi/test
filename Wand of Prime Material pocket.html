<p>A wand of Prime Material pocket was an enchanted wand capable of creating a safe, spherical pocket within any plane of existence .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The conditions within the created sphere matched those of the wielder's Prime Material plane including ground, air, and a steady temperature. The bottom one third of the sphere was ground or water, while the upper two thirds were air. While the conditions outside of the sphere were kept at bay, creatures and items could pass through the sphere's barrier.</p>
<p>A single expended charge created a sphere measuring 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter. Larger spheres could be created at an additional expenditure of one charge per additional 10 feet of diameter. Each sphere lasted between 7–13 hours unless located on the Elemental Plane of Fire , in which case they only lasted from 1–6 hours. The sphere's duration could be extended by using additional charges. A dispel magic spell would negate the sphere.</p>
<p>A wand of Prime Material pocket was not rechargeable.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
