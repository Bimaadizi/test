<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grazkahn was among several influential denizens of the lower planes pulled to Toril by the Order of the Crippled Fang, under the command of archwizard Maganus in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR . Among other fiends enslaved by the cult was Grazkahn's enemy Kazz'Temmet , the Master of the Twelve Blades of Gorgos. The cult unleashed the fiends on the Moonsea region, interrupting trade, sowing destruction, and attacking Zhentarim -controlled territories.</p>
<p>Grazkahn was bound by summoning magics and put in charge of the attack on the Shind Road and its Zhent patrols. The slaadi forces were among the creatures that plagued the road when the Hero of Daggerford and his allies traveled from the town of Voonlar to Hillsfar to investigate the cult. By that time, Grazkahn had already spent a month on the prime material and was bored of its solid form. Kazz'Temmet sought the Hero's aid in slaying Grazkahn and buying him invaluable time that would allow the balor to break free of magical bondage and stay on Toril of his own free will.</p>
<p>While Kazz'Temmet plotted, Grazkahn hatched his own scheme against the enemy. He ordered the Hero of Daggerford to kill the balor and retrieve his enchanted Abyssal blade . Grazkahn knew of the blade's powers, and its connection to the lower planes, and the death slaad hoped to use the magic weapon to sever his summoning binds.</p>
<p>It was unrecorded which side the Hero of Daggerford chose if any. But eventually, the Shind Road's fiend infestation was ended, along with the chaos brought on by the Order of the Crippled Fang.</p>
