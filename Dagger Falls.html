<p>Daggers Falls was a large, stone-walled town in the Daggerdale region of the Dalelands . The town was situated near a steep waterfall of the same name.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Dagger Falls had a strong stone wall encompassing the town and whilst under the rule of Zhentil Keep boasted a garrison of 100 Zhentilar soldiers, 200 mercenaries, and roughly 130 Dalesmen reserves. Two gatehouses guarded the entrances to the town, holding 35 troops each, located by the northern forest gate and eastern river gate.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The site was once used as a storage site for dwarven metals mined from the Desertsmouth Mountains to the east. As all cargo heading along the River Tesh needed to be unloaded before the Dagger Falls and reloaded on the other side it wasn't long before humans and other folk began coming to the site to trade with the dwarves. It was here that dwarven fortifications for the shipments sprang up and the beginnings of the village grew.</p>
<p>Dagger Falls had long been the seat of power for Daggerdale if only by virtue of it being the largest settlement. The Morn family ruled the dale from Dagger Falls for centuries until 1336 DR when the Zhentarim agents deposed them.</p>
<p>The town was then primarily controlled by series of Zhentilar-nominated constables, who held it until Randal Morn's triumphant retaking of Dagger Falls in 1369 DR .</p>
<p>In 1372 , it still existed as a frontier town under the authority of Randal Morn , Lord of Daggerdale.</p>
