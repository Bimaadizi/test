<p>Moonflower , also known as blueshine, was a species of beautiful flowering plant which was cultivated in Evereska and Silverymoon , and grew wild in the Dessarin Valley .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Moonflowers were tiny white cup-shaped flowers that looked somewhat similar to tulips . Each flower was surrounded by four triangular green leaves that glowed blue in moonlight while the flower itself glowed white.</p>
<p>Moonflowers found in Silverymoon could glow during any time of the day thanks to a simple cantrip invented by the city's wizards .</p>
<p>In the Dessarin Valley, wild blueshine grew alongside the snowdrift plant that was similar to clover . Moonflowers of the High Dale were rare and grew atop deep snow, attracting Sembian alchemists on a monthly basis.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Erlevaun Dathnyar , a moon elf of Evereska, had a beautiful small garden bathed in gentle moonflower glow. He died in his garden in 1348 DR , murdered by Horaundoon of the Zhentarim .</p>
