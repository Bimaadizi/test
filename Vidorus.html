<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vidorus reported directly to Kya Mordrayn , the Wearer of Purple in charge of the Cult's operations in the ruins of the elven city. During that time, the Grand Overseer beheaded Overseer Fanraet for his failure to deal with the members of the Sisterhood of Silver Fire who tried to defend Myth Drannor from the invading forces. Vidorus sent Fanraet's head as a dire warning to the Overseer Sinod who was to take care of a group of rebellious orog mercenaries.</p>
