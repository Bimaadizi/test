<p>Prinski's Motivator , or simply Motivator , was a magical device that worked with a set of attuned incineration collars , used by the cultists of Bane in Baldur's Gate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Prinski's Motivator was a device resembling a sharp-edged purse crystal encased in a chassis of gold. The crystal floated and glowed when activated.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Each Motivator was connected to a collection of incineration collars nearby; once activated, they could instantly kill all the collared persons. If the Black Gauntlet dropped the device, it would automatically activate with some delay, killing every shackled slave around it. If Prinski's Motivator was handled by someone unaware of its inner workings, it had a chance of detonating itself, along with the nearby incineration collars .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Motivators and incineration collars were used by the Black Gauntlets of Bane under the leadership of Lord Enver Gortash to "motivate" Gondian workers of the Steel Watch Foundry to produce steel watchers around the clock. Followers of Bane, the god of tyranny, insisted that enslaved Gondians remained aware of what they were forced to do and suffered from knowing what they'd done.</p>
