<p>The Magebanes were a group of adventurers who operated circa 1369 DR . They were warriors who were notable for disdaining and distrusting all sorts of magical spells and items.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Magebanes attended a party hosted by Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Manor in Suzail . The occasion was King Azoun Obarskyr IV 's birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.</p>
<p>After the festivities, it appeared that Lord Thistle had been murdered by extraordinary means, but the Magebane's aversion to using spells or magical items made them an unlikely culprits.</p>
