<p>Lynkhab was a tanar'ri demon lord titled the Lady of Regret who was associated with both desire and depression. She was a patron of the self-destructive.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lynkhab was technically an entity of pure will, who continually reformed herself as to be the embodiment of desire. Most recently, she preferred to take the form of a voluptuous elf with fire-colored hair and eyes like burning ice. However, she also could see what a creature found desirable and change to match.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lynkhab experienced both desire and despair at the same time. She sought to die, but as an entity of pure will she could not die.</p>
<h2>Divine Realm</h2>
<p>She reigned over the 297 th layer of the Abyss , the Sighing Cliffs . However, she also wandered the Abyss without fear because she could not die.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lynkhab could and would forget herself for a time to force herself out of existence, but since she embodied desire she always returned after a few days. She was also known to seek out mortal adventurers in the Abyss in attempts to kill herself, but would kill the adventurers if they failed.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lynkhab was once a major rival of Malcanthet , Shami-Amourae , and Xinivrae .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lynkhab was one of the contenders for the title Queen of the Succubi, but lost to Malcanthet, becoming a shadow of her former self, unable to offer any real resistance to Malcanthet. Somehow, she came to express the idea of desire so completely that she became a disembodied creature, too incohesive to continue to gain power and change.</p>
<p>After Shami-Amourae's release from the Wells of Darkness, she sought an alliance with both Lynkhab and Xinivrae, and there was some possibility that their combined forces could seriously threaten Malcanthet.</p>
