<p>Pale Petras was a vampire spawn and one of the favorite "children" of the vampire lord Cazador Szarr , who resided in the Szarr Palace of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Petras was a pale human male with crimson eyes that glowed with the typical sinister vampire's gaze. Like his "siblings," Petras's back was carved with infernal runes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like his "siblings," the purpose of Petras's existence was a powerful ritual to be performed by Cazador Szarr in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . As a result, the vampire spawns were to be destroyed, and their power would transform Cazador into a vampire ascendant . Petras was known to hunt alongside his "sister," Dalyria , and during one of these hunts, the two might had came across the prodigal "sibling," Astarion Ancun√≠n and the Absolute Adversaries , as they reached the city of Baldur's Gate. Eventually, all of Cazador's spawn were needed for the ritual to succeed; however, it was unknown if the Black Mass was successful and if Petras was destroyed, or if the Black Mass never was completed, leaving Petras freed from his dark master, or if he was slain in the process by the Absolute Adversaries and Astarion.</p>
