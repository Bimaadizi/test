<p>Q'nidar , more popularly known as vapor bats , were a feared species of bat -like creatures that inhabited the warmer reaches of Wildspace .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures had a semi-crystalline hide, similar to that of a radiant dragon . They often flew in an erratic fashion, due to their thermal senses being confused by background heat, but were quite fast. Most q'nidar were capable of flying 51 miles (82 kilometers) per hour after absorbing large quantities of their food source, comparable to the speed of some spelljammers .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>These creatures had a low level of intellect and never engaged in combat for malicious reasons. Out of a sort of racial instinct, when on the verge of death a q'nidar would seek to fly towards the nearest star so they could die from over-absorption, their bodies often getting pulled into the star afterwards.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Q'nidar had an innate ability to sense, detect, and absorb heat energy, as well as to absorb light. They also could unleash a charged breath of hot air. This breath was harmless within the void of Wildspace, but would ignite in an atmospheric envelope, such as that found in a spelljammer, creating a 30 feet (9.1 meters) cone of flame that was 10 feet (3 meters) wide at its end. If they were to unleash their breath weapon within the Phlogiston , it would create a fatally engulfing ball of flame.</p>
<p>Over-absorption of heat was a fatal for q'nidar and caused a biological process wherein their bodies fully crystalized. They took on a different crystalline structure, however, if this death was caused by either their breath in the Phlogiston or being subjected to powerful castings of fireball .</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Q'nidar typically attacked spelljammers with their breath weapon solely for the purpose of generating heat, often doing so if they were brought out of spelljamming speed by a ship passing by. They always intending to eventually absorb the heat generated by their flames, consequently causing them to be gradually extinguished. However, if their feeding process was interrupted by someone attacking them, a q'nidar would "scream" at the offending spelljammer, unleashing its breath continually until it ensured that it would no longer be interfered with whilst feeding.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Q'nidar traveled in packs, usually moving in single-line formations, allowing them to feed upon the heat trails of their pack leader.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>These creatures subsisted off of heat and light. Any heat or light they consumed was visible in the form of a sort of vaporous trail, constantly arcing around and through their bodies.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Despite subsisting off of heat, Q'nidar were not always found around heat-based celestial bodies, for too much background heat could confuse their senses and make it difficult to communicate with one another. They could most commonly be found along the spaceways and trade lanes of Wildspace. And they were rarely ever found in the Phlogiston.</p>
<p>Among the known crystal spheres , they could be found in both Krynnspace and Realmspace .</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Q'nidar uniquely communicated amongst themselves via a thermal breath.</p>
<h3>Usages</h3>
<p>Q'nidar hides maintained their heat and light absorption properties, thus they served as excellent material components for heat-based and light-based spells and could make an effective source of lighting when heated. A fully crystalized q'nidar corpse had the additional property of absorbing magic , making them suitable as minor spelljamming helms if carved out into a proper seat.</p>
<p>The different crystalline body structure exhibited by q'nidar who died in the Phologiston or from severe fireball assaults were found to be an effective material for crystal balls .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These creatures were first discovered and named by the dracons , the name meaning "heat-eaters" in their language. Early on there were many disastrous encounters between q'nidar and spelljammers, who often mistook them for other members of their species and would attempt to communicate with them. While they eventually recognized that spelljammers were not other q'nidar, the creatures came to the realization that "talking" to these ships generated a considerable amount of heat that they could consume.</p>
<p>Around the early 1360s DR , the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company of Toril employed one or more q'nidar.</p>
