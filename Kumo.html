<p>The Kumo clan of Kozakura was a ruthless spy and assassin organization that operated in Kara-Tur as early as several decades before the early 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous assassin and spy of the clan was the man named Ryomaru who wielded an ingenious weapon called Ryomaru's Harmless Staff . After several missions with the weapon, he left it in the care of the Hojori Temple that served as the front for the organization. Eventually, the temple was burglarized by the renowned thief called "Chicken" Wu-Wei , who took the Ryomaru's Harmless Staff as well as other precious treasures. The Kumo clan pursued the thief to his home country of Shou Lung as soon as the burglary was discovered, but Wu-Wei escaped from them by moving across the sea and the Eastern Ocean .</p>
<p>The Kumo clan did not take the thievery lightly. They dispatched three more assassins after Wu-Wei. The first one assassinated all those who were involved in the pursuit into Shou Lung, as failure was not an option for the clan. The second assassin was sent after "Chicken" to track him to the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn . And the last assassin was dispatched to torture and kill every relative of the thief. Wu-Wei was not worried about the third assassin. The thief's only living relative was his aging father, a miserable drunken wretch who had beaten his mother and young sister to death many years prior.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Kumo clan caught up with Wu-Wei many years later, but they were too late and found only the man's tombstone. The Daring Chicken lived out his life in comfort, and all the treasures of the Hojori Temple were long sold off.</p>
