<p>A viper was a common type of venomous snake that varied greatly in size and appearance.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Vipers were not especially aggressive, but would bite if they felt threatened before trying to slither away. They were solitary predators.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Vipers used their bites and venom to kill prey and defend themselves. This venom harmed a victim's health.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<p>In 1374 DR , the Shadowscale lizardfolk placed captured small black vipers inside sealed clay pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The hungry and angry snake would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales. A snake of this kind could be spawned once per day by use of a costly viper dagger .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>With the spell summon nature's ally I a small viper could be called upon, and with summon nature's ally II it would be a medium viper that answered the call. Summon nature's ally III would result in a large viper being summoned, and a huge viper would come forth with summon nature's ally IV . A small fiendish viper could be summoned with the summon monster I spell, and with summon monster II either 3 small fiendish vipers or a medium fiendish viper would arrive. Likewise summon monster III would bring forth 3 medium fiendish vipers or one large, and summon monster IV get bring the spellcaster either 3 large fiendish vipers or one huge. Finally the spell summon monster V would result in 3 huge vipers being summoned.</p>
