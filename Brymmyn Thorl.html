<p>Brymmyn Thorl was the Magister from 244 DR to 246 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Brymmyn was a spade-bearded giant of a man with cold eyes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He planned for every time he left his stronghold, intending never to be taken by surprise.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He had a lair in the Troll Mountains , and several others in different places. All of them, he shrouded in a network of magical traps that polymorphed or destroyed outright any intruder.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He spent much of his time creating "safeholds" and building them into the operation of gates he found, thus allowing him to reach spaces that differed from those that other users of the same portals reached.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Brymmyn Thorl won against the previous Magister, Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler , on the latter's second duel in office. Afterwards, he spent much time building safeholds into portals. At some point in 246 DR , the challenger Corthas Muhleer infiltrated his tower and transformed himself into Brymmyn's bed, and thus was inside his wards when he came to visit for a final time while moving out the last of his magical possessions. Corthas gave him a restless, fitful sleep before he woke the Magister and challenged him to a duel. Brymmyn lost when he was shattered while transformed into a gargoyle .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Rumors continued after the destruction of his tower that there was magic left unclaimed.</p>
