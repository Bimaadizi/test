<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the early spring of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Tanareve was tasked with finding Graeme ibn-Naif, a missing elderly acolyte of the Temple of Tempus . Graeme was sent on a simple mission but never returned. Tanareve set out to reach the Trading Post outside of Hillsfar, despite the perilousness of the roads, believing that the aged cleric was attacked by the bandits near the outpost. One thing that the cleric carried on him at the time of disappearance was the Holy Texts of Asrigir , the Bearded Seer of the Moonsea , but they had no value to simple brigands. Despite the Temple of Tempus' Overseer ordering retrieval of the texts as the primary focus of the operation, Tanareve valued the aged acolyte's life more.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, Tanareve reached the Trading Post and eagerly inhaled its many aromas: roasting meat , cinnamon , ale , horses, and exotic trade goods from far away. The cleric of Tempus headed to the Trading Post's inn after walking through its many market stalls. There, he partook in an eveningfeast of stewed goose and wine and discovered the aged acolyte stayed at the inn just several days prior on his way to a local landmark â€“ the Big Tree .</p>
<p>In the first rays of morning light, Tanareve rode out towards the Tree, remembering the old acolyte mentioning the old serene Tree in the past. At the landmark, Tanareve quickly came across signs of struggle. Worried for his friend's life, the cleric could not identify the attackers: their arrows bore no distinct marks, and broken spears were just as mundane. Frustrated, Tanareve sat under the Tree, closed his eyes, and began mulling over the situation, but when he opened his eyes, Faith, his horse, was gone.
Arming himself with a hammer, Tanareve cautiously walked around the massive Tree only to discover Faith calmly grazing on the grass near a locked chest. Inside was Graeme ibn-Naif, bound and gagged, weakened but still somehow alive.</p>
<p>Shouting a prayer of healing to the god of battle, Tanareve pulled the old friend from the brink of death. Now, all the acolyte needed to recover was bread and wine. Graeme revealed that six men on horses came across the priest sleeping under the Big Tree. In a scuffle, Graeme managed to break one of the attackers' arm and concussed another one but was eventually bested by bowmen. The aged acolyte thought it funny that all the bandits got from the attack was the "long-winded ramblings of Asrigir " and "the most stupid donkey this side of Cormyr ."</p>
<p>With his friend's life saved, Tanareve now had to retrieve the Holy Texts of Asrigir . The cleric headed back out from the Trading Post first thing in the morning after hearing of a highwaymen robbery from a group of merchants at the inn. The attack happened near the home of a local hermit, north of the Trading Post. The bandit camp was discovered deep within a dark wood, about five miles away from the main road. Arriving just in time, Tanareve witnessed the bandits complaining about the worthless holy texts, getting ready to give them a proper cremation in the campfire. The cleric attacked, murmuring a prayer to Tempus. The divine spell worked, and the thrown hammer turned into a blazing ball of fire. The spiritual hammer walloped at the nearby robbers, promptly sending them fleeing in a panic of a sorcerous attack. It did not take him long to find the stolen texts and return them to the Temple of Tempus in Hillsfar.</p>
