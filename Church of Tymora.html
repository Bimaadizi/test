<p>The Church of Tymora ( pronounced : / t aɪ ˈ m ɔːr ɑː / ty-MOR-ah ) was an organization dedicated to the worship of the goddess of good luck, Tymora .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Tymoran temples were spread throughout the heartlands of Faerûn . Places of worship differed significantly from each other in powers, manners, and titles, though, with little overall authority or hierarchy. They were independent from each other, and each temple reflected the tastes of its high priestess or priest. Despite their differences, they also had some standards that were present in most of the temples. The common item worn by all clergy of Lady Luck was the disk of Tymora , usually carried on a small chain, on a neck-chain or in a setting on the forehead, while blue and silver colors were often seen on clerical dresses. Some temples were known to have sanctioned, holy casinos nearby, where believers could appeal to Tymora at all times.</p>
<p>The Church of Tymora didn't discriminate, and saw all races and sexes as equal in the eyes of Tymora. However, in practice, most exalted ranks of the priesthood consisted of human women.</p>
<p>Tymoran Clerics , that were often called "luckbringers", believed that those who took the greatest risks were the ones who enjoyed the greatest fortunes. They positioned their temples as refueling stops to help adventuring bands.</p>
<p>Among regular priests of Tymora, there were clerics that oversees games of chance, called the luckriders . These priests made sure that there was no cheating in the games of chance. They were familiar with the rules to all games that involved luck and often participated in them.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<p>Members of Tymoran faith believed that one should be bold and trust in one's own luck. Priests of Tymora were taught to think of themselves as their own masters and be brave enough to accept both good and bad fortune, as a trust in their goddess and in themselves.</p>
<p>Worshipers were urged to take risks and place themselves in the hands of fate and Lady Luck, to live life dangerously, following the reckless path or "the Lady's Way".</p>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , Tymoran faith attempted to unify the church under a grand patriarch. That suggestion was given by high priest of the Lady's House in Arabel , Daramos Lauthyr .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Tymoran clergy would often go throughout the lands of Faerûn and urge people to take chances and pursue their dreams, yet wouldn't encourage them to indulge in reckless whims and frivolity, while they discouraged wasting time making plans without ever doing anything. They aided those who had dared to reinforce the message of the good fortune that one can get by having enough trust in Tyche 's Fair-Haired Daughter. Members of Tymoran clergy were also duty-bound to aid the daring by providing healing and even some minor magic items .</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p>The clergy of Tymora was always united by their rituals of greeting. They would touch each other's holy symbols of Tymora, after watchwords of recognition had been exchanged. To strangers and other beings whom they knew to be worshipers of Tymora, they said "Life is short. Live it as Tymora means it to be lived!" This was answered by: "Dare all, and trust in the Lady." The watchwords between friends, or members of clergy of Tymora, were simpler: "Defy," answered by "Dare much."</p>
<p>Midsummer was the most important festival of Tymora. During celebration, people would engage in a night of daring adventure, wild revels, mischievous pranks, and romantic trysts.</p>
<p>The most holy festival of Tymora was Starfall , which occurred on the 22 nd day of Marpenoth . On this date, clergy who had earned advancement were formally acclaimed and presented with tokens and vestments appropriate to their new station. On that day, Tymorans would observe Starfall, which was believed to be the anniversary of the destruction of Tyche and the birth of Tymora.</p>
<p>During their stays in the Cormyrian city of Suzail , Tymoran priestesses would often travel barefoot to the Lady's House, a temple in the capital of the country, to commemorate Tymora's journey to Arabel in 1358 DR during the Time of Troubles , when she protected that city during the crisis.</p>
<p>In Amn , pearls were deeply associated with luck, to the extent that clerics of Tymora used coins and pearls, mainly black ones, as symbols of their goddess. However, Tymoran clerics in other regions considered this practice nearly heretical. The terms "finding" and "losing" pearls served as euphemisms for good and bad luck, respectively.</p>
