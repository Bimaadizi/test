<p>The Hood of the Weave was an enchanted hood that once belonged to the famed mage Tenser of Oerth .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The hood made the wearer's spells fly true and hit their mark with ease. It also made their spells harder to resist, dodge, or shrug off.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Hood of the Weave was originally worn by Tenser on the world of Greyhawk during the ceremony of induction into the Circle of Eight . Following it, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, Otiluke and Bigby pranked Tenser, but, thanks to the hood, they found their vodka glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy pixies .</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Hood of the Weave ended up in the hands of a powerful mummy lord of Baldur's Gate – the Mystic Carrion . The hood and its undead master could be found in Philgrave's Mansion in the Gate's Lower City .</p>
