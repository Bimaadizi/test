<p>Eleuthra Davos was a Ffolk druid from Moray in the Moonshae Isles in the late 15 th century DR . She was killed in the late 1470s DR while battling drow beneath the island of Gwynneth .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eleuthra was tall, thin, and conventionally pretty, with dark hair, dark skin, and blue-black eyes. She wore a wolf 's pelt as a cloak , with the beast's head serving as a hood, and carried a totem stick .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was impatient and curt. She respected loyalty and bravery.</p>
<p>She harbored a fierce hatred for all fey , including elves , owing to the generational memory of her family having been slaughtered at Caer Corwell during the rise of Sarifal . She made no secret of her hatred and stated it openly, although paradoxically, she was uncomfortable when others expressed similar overt hatred. She dreamed to see Sarifal destroyed in order to return Gwynneth to the paradise she believed it to have once been.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Eleuthra and her partner, Einar Stormsson , served King Derid Kendrick as spies within the ranks of the Black Blood tribe of lycanthropes . They used their shapechanging abilities to assume the form of beasts , allowing them to pass as fellow lycanthropes. Eleuthra's preferred beast form was that of an enormous, brindled wolf. She was devoted to her duty to serve as the king's eyes and ears on Moray.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 1470s DR, the Black Blood tribe of Moray began a ritual in the abandoned city below Scourtop to revive Malar, who had been presumed dead since the early days of the Spellplague . Eleuthra and Einar teamed up with a golden elf known as the Savage (an ally of two sacrificial victims forced to participate in the ritual) to disrupt Malar's return, a goal for which she was happy to set aside her fey bigotry. The trio invaded Malar's tomb but failed to stop the ritual, resulting in the death of Einar and the injury and capture of Eleuthra and the Savage. The pair were chained together in an old tomb , where Eleuthra became aware of the Savage's true nature as an heir to House Dlardrageth . She reiterated her hatred of him, but also acknowledged that she respected that he fought for her. They escaped their bonds after she transformed into a wolf, and in that shape she was drawn to a loregem buried in a sarcophagus, which the Savage retrieved, and to a large thighbone inscribed with runes, which she claimed for herself as a substitute totem stick.</p>
<p>Fleeing from Malar's lycanthropes, Eleuthra and the Savage travelled together, although she continued to accost and accuse him of being a vile and greedy fey. Perhaps because his mind was clouded by the magic he had brought from the tomb, the Savage found the abuse endlessly endearing, and quickly developed an infatuation and love for Eleuthra. She did not appear to reciprocate, but eventually found that she was indeed attracted to him but also hated him. Her confused feelings led to them sleeping together, then to her trying to make him jealous, and finally to her attacking him. However, when he gave his life to help her and his surviving comrades escape from Malar through a portal to Gwynneth, she found herself heartbroken and beside herself at his apparent death.</p>
<p>She traveled for a short time with the Savage's friends— Lukas , Gaspar-shen , and their new ally, Amaranth —until they were led into a trap in the Underdark beneath Winterglen by a drow priestess named Amaka . As the drow set upon them in overwhelming numbers, the still-grieving Eleuthra had a vision of the Savage inviting her to join him in death. She assumed her wolf form and targeted the drow leader, a hierophant , inflicting grievous wounds before the drow's magic killed her.</p>
