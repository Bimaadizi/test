<p>Unger Hilldark was a duergar merchant in the City of Coin, Athkatla of Amn , in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir Sarles of the Jysstev Estate sought 200 pounds (91 kilograms) of pure illithium ore to work on a piece commissioned by the Church of Helm . The only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who occasionally had access to the elusive material was Jerlia , who ran her business from the Waukeen's Promenade . Despite Sir Sarles's demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of illithium ore per season. She also revealed that her source of the substance was a duergar merchant, Unger Hilldark, operating out of the Copper Coronet . Coincidentally, a serial killer named Neb stole a huge shipment of illithium from Unger around the same time. Gorion's Ward involved itself in illithium's retrieval from Neb on Unger's behalf, however, the outcome of the task remained unrecorded.</p>
