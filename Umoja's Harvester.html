<p>Umoja's Harvester was an enchanted Ubtaoan sickle wielded by druid Umoja in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Harvester appeared as a quite mundane metallic sickle.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Umoja's Harvester possessed several minor enchantments. When it was wielded in battle, it functioned as a +1 magic weapon. Additionally, it imbued its owner with a small amount of health and stamina. Ubtaoan magics made the sickle only usable by only humans , only druids, and only individuals who revered powers of good.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Umoja was a kind and gentle man who preferred to use the Harvester for the cultivation of the jungle's lands in a way that did not interfere with natural balance. However, he was a capable fighter, and when pushed into conflict, Umoja used the Harvester to reap lives instead of crops. By the 1374 DR , Umoja carried his Harvester to the city of Samargol , guided by the will of his deity.</p>
