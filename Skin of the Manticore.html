<p>The Skin of the Manticore was a unique enchanted cloak from the Moonsea region that could only be used by druids and rangers .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Skin of the Manticore was just that, a skin of the fearsome monstrosity known as a manticore , sewn into the shape of a cloak and promptly enchanted. Manticores' tail spikes were their most deadly weapon and the Skin had the beast's tail attached to it after the creature was skinned.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Skin possessed a common +1 enchantment, and it slightly improved the wearer's fortitude. However, the most notable power of this magic cloak was the ability to control the Skin's spiked tail four times a day, in combat or otherwise. The deadly tail carried the beast's paralytic venom.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>An elven ranger Daegasus managed to slay a fearsome manticore by himself sometime long before 1374 DR . The ranger took the monstrosity's hide to a wizard , and together, they developed this unique magic cloak. The unnamed wizard was able to enchant the cloak so its wearer could control the manticore's tail. The Skin of the Manticore remained with Daegasus until his death and then swiftly disappeared.</p>
<p>Years later, circa 1374 DR, the cloak resurfaced during the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis in the Moonsea region.</p>
