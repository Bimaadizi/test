<h2>History</h2>
<p>Rajiram was exiled from his home, and so came to the Nelanther Isles . There, he won favor with the pirates that lived there and rose to become a powerful pirate captain himself.</p>
<p>The Baron was active for at least decades before the 1480s DR , when he clashed with SEER and Bitter-root of the Lords' Alliance .</p>
<p>In the 1480s DR , Rajiram attacked Durlag's Tower , in an attempt to recover a magical tablet which was able to reactivate the Ark of the Mountains . SEER sent adventuers to combat the Baron's forces and obtain the treasure of the Tower before he could. Rajiram hired twin mercenary dwarves, Bahldrak and Bellegia Slagspit to patrol the surrounds of the Tower and assasinate the adventuerers. Later, as the adventurers entered into the tower, Rajiram sent his simulacrum to obtain the tablet. The adventurers countered Rajiram's efforts and recovered the tablet.</p>
<p>Later, Rajiram sent his followers from his flying ship to plunder the ruins of the Ulcaster School of Wizardry near Beregost . SEER and the recently-revived Ulcaster , sent adventurers to protect Ulcaster's secret library from the pirates.</p>
<p>Still desperate to recover the tablet that had once been in Durlag's Tower , Rajiram sent a message to Beregost . Unless the tablet was given to him, he threatened to violently destroy Beregost from Thunderbound . In order to save the town, SEER gathered adventurers together and raised the Ark of the Mountains from Durlag's Tower. The adventurers took control of the Ark, and flew it in an epic sky battle against the Baron.</p>
