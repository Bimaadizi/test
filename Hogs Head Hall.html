<p>Hogs Head Hall was the headquarters for the Fellowship of Herders and Butchers , a local guild that operated within the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff during the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This building stood on the corner of Manycoins Way and Vesper Way , in the Torchtown neighborhood of Uptown.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Within this aromatic building, which doubled as the guild's meeting hall and dressing area, they taught apprentices how to dress, carve, and smoke all manner of animals. The fellowship members were quite considerate to their neighbors on Manycoins Way in that they rinsed blood into the nearest street grate into the sewers with buckets of water and shipped their leftover fat and bones out of the city for rendering.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Fellowship in the Hogs Head, the streets of Torchtown were often filled with the delightful aroma of smoked meats.</p>
