<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Broodhull Clan ruled over the mountains of the Vilhon Reach region in Central Faerûn for centuries until its mysterious disappearance. Within a single year, all two hundred members of Clan Broodhull were gone, leaving behind only empty halls. Some claimed that the clan's halls were haunted and one could still hear ghosts of the past inhabitants echoing across the empty walls. One artifact that the Broodhull Clan left behind was a glittering, rune-carved, mighty war hammer – simply called Rune Hammer .</p>
