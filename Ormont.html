<p>Ormont was a laborer who worked the docks of the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ormont was a human man with a light skin tone, blue eyes, and brown hair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Ormont and his friend Tugelnhorn were harborhands â€“ laborers who were faced with much work, little pay, and poor work conditions. Tugelnhorn was dissatisfied with the job, but, unlike Ormont and other laborers, thought striking in the face of the encroaching army of the Absolute was a bad idea. Ormont, on the other hand, predicted that their living conditions and wages would plummet thanks to an influx of poor refugees into the Gate.</p>
