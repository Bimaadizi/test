<p>Thamor was an independent trading city found in central Threskel .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>While Thamor was officially ruled by a human lord, leadership was controlled at least in part by Threskel's capital city of Mourktar . Like other cities in Threskel, Thamor's lord served the chromatic dragons loyal to the Great Bone Wyrm that reigned over the entire realm.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>As of the mid–14 th century DR , most of the city's traders exchanged goods with farmers from the badlands along the southern stretch of Threskel, as well as the miners that made their living in the Riders to the Sky mountain range.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The city was founded as a place where traders from Unther and Mulhorand could freely exchange goods without having to pay any taxes. Unfortunately, officials from both nations objected and the leadership of Thamor was forced to follow their laws of trade.</p>
<p>After the collapse of Unther following Gilgeam 's death during the Avatar Crisis of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Thamor struggled for some time before experiencing a strong recovery. The city was taken over along with the rest of Threskel a mere seven years later.</p>
