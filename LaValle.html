<p>La Valle was a competent wizard who was one of the lieutenants of Pasha Pook in Calimport , Calimshan , in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>La Valle explained to both Drizzt Do'Urden and Artemis Entreri that his loyalty was first and foremost to the organization itself, not to a particular leader, so he served loyally someone that cared about the guild. He had no more ambition than to live freely and comfortably and to practice his magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>La Valle had been a lieutenant in Pasha Pook's guild for a long time and knew Artemis Entreri very well. He often used his magic to help Entreri plot his assassinations. In return, Entreri performed at least one murder on La Valle's behalf.</p>
<p>Under the orders of his boss, La Valle was involved in fighting with the Companions of the Hall when they came searching for Regis in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR . Thanks to his powerful magical artifact, the Taros Hoop , La Valle sent the heroes to the plane of Tarterus . To his great surprise, Drizzt Do'Urden and his friends came back, smashing the Taros Loop in the process. La Valle surrendered.</p>
<p>Later, La Valle became a lieutenant of the new guildmaster, Regis.</p>
<p>Some years later, Artemis again met La Valle, now a lieutenant of a new guildmaster. La Valle told Enteri that his new boss was a good man.</p>
