<p>A torque of the Goddess , later called an Earthmother torc , was a magical silver neck ring worn as a protective ornament by the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles , especially druids .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were rope -like silver collars adorned with images representing the serenity of nature, such as stylized acorns , holly berries, fern fronds, and oak leaves.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The torque when worn was equivalent to a ring of protection , but this advantage could not be combined with other rings of protection .</p>
<p>It also granted significant benefits against lycanthropes , preventing the wearer from contracting lycanthropy and other lycanthrope diseases (though they could still be physically harmed when attacked by such creatures). The torque increased the wearer's striking and damaging potential against these monsters in combat, and also rendered the lycanthrope vulnerable to unarmed attacks. Once per day, some torcs allowed the wearer to disrupt a lycanthrope's ability to shapechange .</p>
<p>These torques could also be worn by and grant their magical benefits to animals , notably dogs .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ffolk devised these protective items in response to the spread of lycanthropy across the Moonshaes by followers of Malar , such as the Black Blood tribe .</p>
