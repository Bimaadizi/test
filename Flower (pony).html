<h2>History</h2>
<p>When a plot was hatched to smuggle the le Shay princess of Sarifal, Amaranth , out of the realm, it was necessary for the conspirators— Valeanne , Shamasar , and his guards—to plan to switch to fresh mounts during for their daylong sprint from Karador in Myrloch Vale to Crane Point in the Highlands . They performed this switch at Glenraugh, where the nine-year-old Amaranth was given Flower to ride.</p>
<p>The girl quickly became attached to Flower, and was devastated when Flower was badly injured by drow arrows as the conspirators were ambushed. With the child unwilling to leave the injured animal's side, Valeanne lost her patience and executed Flower with a crossbow bolt through the head.</p>
