<p>The Eveningstar Cavern was a cave near Eveningstar in Cormyr , which became an important location during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The cave was south of Eveningstar across the Starwater River , off the Starwater Road . It had a skylight that a small waterfall flowed through, filling an underground pool and letting some plants and trees grow inside. The drow of Sschindylryn opened several portals in this cavern, which led to various points in the Underdark and Demonweb Pits .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Early in the surface invasion by Sschindylryn, the drow secured the Eveningstar Cavern and used it as a forward base, complete with portals linking to their reinforcements. They stored captured prisoners in a pen there, interrogating them about the Thread of the Weave , and then sending them into the Underdark to be enslaved . In the midst of this operation, bold adventurers from Eberron who had fought the Spinner of Shadows and traversed the Rift Between Worlds arrived in the Underdark, fighting their way to the surface from behind the drow force. After passing through the D'zani Outpost , they arrived in the cavern and attacked the drow there, slaying the commander Ydrae Avithoul in the process. The drow were soundly defeated and their prisoners freed, among whom was Ana Brabener . Immediately after the battle the Purple Dragons and War Wizards secured the cavern, preventing the drow from launching any more attacks from the portals and letting them use those same portals in later counterattacks on Sschindylryn and the Demonweb.</p>
