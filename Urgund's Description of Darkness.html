<p>Urgund's Description of Darkness was a book telling of the author's captivity in the lower planes .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although it was a grim work, it was not much more than a listing of names and palaces, for the horrors within them were too much to set down on paper . It was written in a strange and hesitant hand, and bound in a black cover.</p>
<p>Notably, in it Urgund made mention of the Seven Lost Gods of antiquity and their service to the god Bane , the Black Lord. He wrote "...and seated foremost in the Hall of Minor Courtiers were the lesser powers : Maram of the Great Spear ; Haask, Voice of Hargut ; Tyranthraxus the Flamed One ; Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud ; and Camnod the Unseen . These too fell down and became servants of the great lord Bane."</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
