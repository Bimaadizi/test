<p>Karador , also called High Karador , was a small and magical city located in the middle of the Myrloch Vale on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles . It long served as the capital of the fey realm of Sarifal .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city had many tall towers of crystal . It was a shining city of many delights that lay in the center of the cold waters of the Myrloch lake. The magic of Sarifal seemed to radiate out from its location.</p>
<p>Visitors to the city were uncommon, and non-fey were not permitted inside.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city and surrounding realm of Sarifal were ruled by the le Shay queen High Lady Ordalf with the help of her le Shay advisors, although her son, Prince Araithe , handled the day-to-day running of the government.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The city sat in the middle of a lake—and was thus sometimes called a "water-citadel" —and was protected by a powerful and unique mythal infused with the power of primal spirits which could shift the city to and from the Feywild . The le Shay who lived in the city were powerful arcane spellcasters, more powerful than elven high mages . So vigilant were the fey defenders that their enemies found it impossible to enter the city unchallenged.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>The city hosted a large number of shrines—but no temples—to the many primal spirits and archfey venerated by the peoples of Sarifal.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Karador was founded circa −10,500 DR when the le Shay first established Sarfial on the Moonshae Isles. It was subsequently all but abandoned in −500 DR when Sarifal retreated to the Feywild, causing the city to sink beneath the water of the Myrloch.</p>
<p>In the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , High Lady Ordalf moved the city through a portal from the Feywild and it rose from the depths of Lake Myrloch. Her fey forces eventually routed the High King's troops and took control of the entire island of Gwynneth.</p>
<p>When Erliza Daressin had become a vampire , she experienced a vision of herself becoming a queen in the Feywild, a destiny which she understood to require her to enter the Feywild through the city of Karador.</p>
<p>By the late 15 th century DR, many eladrin were abandoning the city and instead going to Synnoria after having come to hate their cruel le Shay rulers. In the late 1460s DR, the eladrin Valeanne and the dragonborn Shamasar tricked the le Shay Princess Amaranth into leaving the city with the intention of spiriting her away to Erliza Daressin's court on Snowdown in order to protect her from the le Shay's machinations.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the longstanding restrictions on visitors began to loosen as High Lady Ordalf saw the need to form alliances. Prince Araithe came to see the value in a union with House Kendrick of Alaron , and so made plans to wed the princess Tarilyn Kendrick , who came to stay as a guest in the city that year.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The city was home to a wide range of fey and fey-touched creatures. This included the few remaining le Shay, but most residents were Llewyrr elves , wood elves , gnomes , or banshrae . The few humans permitted to live in the city were ambassadors from faraway High Imaskar . A band of elite dragonborn guards protected the royal family.</p>
