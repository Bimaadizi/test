<p>Greenlords and greenladies were specialty priests of the Church of Silvanus who passionately defended flora and fauna, often to the detriment of nearby civilized regions.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Greenlords viewed any mark of civilization as an affront to Silvanus , including roads and cultivated land. They carefully monitored civilized expansion to ensure it did not encroach too far into the wild. They would visit towns and cities if needed, but preferred to spend their time in the wild.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Though they did not despise humans and demihumans , a greenlord's actions did favor flora and fauna instead.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A greenlord could speak with animals and plants three times per day. They could also transform into an animal of their choosing on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Given the perverse nature of the undead and a greenlord's close tie with living things, they risked being temporarily petrified with fear when encountering them. A greenlord could not turn undead .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Greenlords wore leather armor decorated with intricate carvings, usually in the form of leaf motifs. They also wore forest green cloaks , bronze neck torcs embedded with green gemstones , and a tan tunic. For weaponry they preferred a wooden quarterstaff .</p>
