<p>Eralynn Thunsonn was a dwarf adventurer and member of the Order of Delvers . She was a good friend and sometimes delving companion of Torrin Ironstar .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Eralynn did not have an easy life. As a youth, her parents were killed by a red dragon when they became separated from a caravan traveling through a cavern system near the East Rift . After she joined the Delvers, she and her delving partner had some sort of accident in which her partner died. Fairly or not, other Delvers blamed Eralynn for her partner's death and considered her unlucky. At some point, she acquired spellscarred hands with which she was able to work some magic . Torrin was the only person who was willing to adventure with her, although much of the time she preferred solo delves.</p>
<p>In the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR , Eralynn handled tainted gold and became infected with the Stoneplague . She traveled to Sundasz , believing that the non-dwarven clerics in that city could cure her. Unfortunately, the clerics of Corellon Larethian could not cure her and she eventually succumbed to the disease.</p>
