<p>Arnglar was a sleepy hill village in the west of the Border Kingdoms , situated not far from where the River Rith and Tumblestone River originated. It was a windswept site suited to pastoral grazing, on a location that was once the elven realm of Glorfindral .</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Unlike many other parts of the Border Kingdoms (see the Garden Coast ), Arnglar's high elevation exposed it to the elements, making it difficult to grow crops that were not protected. Arnglar was home to shepherds who kept flocks on the hillsides. The burial mounds of the elven kings of Glorfindral formed a ring around the village. The water supply was crystal-clear and came from a deep well which had never run dry.</p>
<h2>Government, Trade and Religion</h2>
<p>Arnglar was ruled by the Circle of Elders, a council of nine of the village's most influential people, including the village blacksmith Harneth Breldren . The village was generally unfriendly to visitors but would trade wool, tallow candles or mutton sausages with passing merchants. It favored lone or small groups of merchants as opposed to large, well-armed bands.</p>
<p>Arnglarrens worshiped Talos in order to appease the god against hurling lightning at the exposed village.</p>
<h2>Badge</h2>
<p>The badge of Arnglar was composed of two circles linked by two diagonal, zigzag lines (the sun or moon over the well, joined by two lightning bolts). It was scratched on boundary stones at the borders of the independent settlement, and a beacon stone in the center of its marketplace.</p>
