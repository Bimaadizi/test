<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , she snuck out of Tier Breche and was punished for it by being forced to cut her own little fingers off. Soon after, she instigated a coup against Mistress Quenthel Baenre , seeking power and believing that demons attempting to assassinate her were signs of Lolth's disfavor of Quenthel. Quenthel discovered the plot and pretended to poison Drisinil in order to have her bring her fellow conspirators to an unused classroom in Arach-Tinilith, where she summoned hordes of spiders that slayed them. During the coup, Drisinil killed her aunt and instructor Molvayas Barrison Del'Armgo , claiming that Molvayas would have betrayed them to Quenthel. As punishment for the plot, Drisinil was allowed to live but her remaining fingers and tongue were cut off.</p>
