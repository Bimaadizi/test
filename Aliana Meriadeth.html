<p>Aliana Meriadeth was a druid of Chauntea and a former werefox adventurer in Raven's Bluff during the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was attractive, still retaining a fox-like coloring and cast to her skin.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She genuinely cared for her friends and tried to take care of them, offering quiet wisdom when she felt it necessary.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Amongst other mundane expertises, Aliana was a practiced cook, herbalist, and healer and was greatly acquainted with weather prediction, the lore of animals, and religious minutia.</p>
<p>More of note, Aliana's wounds had begun to close almost instantly, with her strength returning twice as fast during rest; this development worried her.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She carried a spear and sling , wore leather armor , and had a potion of ESP .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>She tried to keep track of things for her fellow adventurer, the wizard Tanis Obereck , and made note that Taldar Everwind had expressed interest in her. Akira Iko , another peer and a warrior , took her aid for granted but didn't treat her as a servant. She felt very close to Serena Worthwood . Her final fellow adventurer was the dwarf Crakadan Earthdigger .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As a child, Aliana only remembered being raised by a werefox, eventually becoming one herself, and then breaking down in tears at the age of seventeen in a temple of Chauntea . There her curse was lifted by a friendly priest, leaving untouched only some of the elfin features that she'd developed due to the lycanthropy . She joined the temple, and later became an adventurer, eventually heading for Raven's Bluff and forming a party.</p>
<p>Before she was embroiled in the conspiracies of the Red Wizard Thule , her wounds had been closing instantly for a while, much like when she was a lycanthrope, which made her worry.</p>
