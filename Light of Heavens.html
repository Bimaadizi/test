<p>Light of Heavens was an aasimar divine champion of Lathander of the Sword Coast North in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>She was the twin sister of Joy .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was tall and beautiful, with the scars of battle. She carried herself with confidence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When she was born, the priests that delivered her exclaimed "light of heavens" (for reasons not revealed), and they decided to name her that. Her twin sister was named Joy.</p>
<p>Both sisters were raised by priests of Lathander and were determined to bring happiness and light to Faerûn . However, their methods of doing so were radically different: Joy decided that dancing was the best way to bring happiness to people, and became a traveling minstrel, while Light of Heavens, believing that fighting evil wherever it could be found was the best way, swore an oath to serve as a Knight of Lathander.</p>
<p>During the evacuation of Neverwinter in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Light of Heavens encountered the Kalach-Cha and party in the Merchant's District , where she tried to get a feel for the now-Knight-Captain of Crossroad Keep . She challenged the Kalach-Cha to a duel to test their resolve in the fight against the shadows. When the Kalach-Cha beat her, she left, but not before saying she would challenge them two more times.</p>
<p>The Kalach-Cha and companions next encountered Light of Heavens at Port Llast , where she revealed how she got the name "Light of Heavens". She then challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time using a larger portion of her strength. Again, the Kalach-Cha defeated her.</p>
<p>Light of Heavens then made her way to Crossroad Keep. There she challenged the Kalach-Cha again, this time at full strength; again, the hero bested her. Impressed, Light of Heavens offered her services as a sergeant in the Graycloaks of Neverwinter . Evidently she left the Graycloaks following the King of Shadows ' defeat. [ speculation ]</p>
<p>Later that year, Light of Heavens would be encountered by another hero whilst traveling, and offer to spar with them.</p>
