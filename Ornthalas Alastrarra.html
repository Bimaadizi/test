<p>Ornthalas Alastrarra was an elven inhabitant of Cormanthor from at least the 3 rd to the 7 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 241 DR , Iymbryl Alastrarra sent Elminster Aumar to Cormanthor , bearing his own kiira , to deliver it upon his brother Ornthalas. At his home, Ornthalas was summoned to find a man in the likeness of Iymbryl holding his sister, Filaurel Alastrarra , as a shield, before a gathering of his immediate family. After the man released Filaurel, he delivered the kiira unto Ornthalas; it bonded quickly, but painfully.</p>
<p>Once he bore the kiira , Ornthalas was supportive of Elminster being taken before the Coronal so that no stain came upon the honor of their family.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Riluaneth often teased if not outright tormented him. He was the heir after the death of his brother, Iymbryl. He was the third son of Namryiitha Alastrarra.</p>
