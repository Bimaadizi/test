<p>The Mithril Legion , or Mithral Legion , was a dwarven army that quested to recover the lost Mines of Tethyamar in the 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Borlin inspired a large number of dwarven warriors to form the Mithril Legion and embark on a quest to reclaim the Mines of Tethyamar. They marched out of Tilverton in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , heading north-west, and vanished, their fate unknown.</p>
<p>Some claimed that Borlin and the Mithril Legion had successfully retaken part of the Mines, and sent a report of such to King Ghellin via magic , but this was only speculation.</p>
<p>In fact, Borlin and the Legion made a successful assault against one of gates into Tethyamar, but ran into an orc -fashioned portal . This transported them deep into the mines, far from the entrance. Steadily, they fought their way through the orcs and back to the surface, but fell one-by-one. Borlin was the last, but he died in sight of Tethyamar's doors.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>The Mithril Legion was led by Borlin, blood of Ghellin, Axe of the Iron House, of the exiled royal court of the Mines of Tethyamar.</p>
