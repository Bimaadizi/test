<p>Undercliff was a rural community just outside the walls of Waterdeep , located east of the city proper. Along with the Field Ward , it was considered an unofficial ward of the city.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Undercliff was a wide area of rolling grassland, with a few wooded areas and several farms, orchards, and areas dedicated to animal husbandry.</p>

Before turning north, the road bifurcated, and its southern branch, known as Southcliff Way , served the southern farms before connecting with the High Road south of the South Gate .</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1479 DR , increasing numbers of dwarves had begun moving from the Field Ward to Undercliff, intending to tunnel into the cliff face and build new homes directly beneath Waterdeep proper. Separate from those of the Warrens , these tunnels broke into sewers and basements, and drew the ire of the Masked Lords who sent patrols of hired adventurers to stop any further mining.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , a group of scarecrows began terrorizing the local population and killing livestock. The Emerald Enclave sent a group of members to deal with the threat.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The area of Undercliff was largely inhabited by halflings and gnomes . Most of the buildings in the area were in fact sized for its small inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Amcathra family held an estate in Undercliff, where they trained horses bred in Amphail and sold them to the City Guard. The Hothemer family also held a villa in the region, where they conducted business outside of Waterdhavian jurisdiction.</p>
