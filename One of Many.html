<h2>History</h2>
<p>The creature was formed when the evil souls were unleashed from their torturous prison by some means between the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR and the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR . Driven by a hunger to consume sentient beings or to sow death and violence upon them, eventually, One of Many manifested in the jungles of the Samarlogh in the hidden kingdom of Samarach on the Chultan Peninsula .</p>
