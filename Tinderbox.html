<p>A tinderbox was a set of tools to quickly light up a fire . The collection of items was also known as flint and steel or flint and tinder .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical tinderboxes were small wood boxes containing flint , one or more pieces of fire steel , and tinder, which usually consisted of a piece of charred cloth soaked in oil as a quick fire starter. Setting a fire ablaze by employing these tools took merely seconds, provided dry fuel was available.</p>
<p>Resistant oak tinderboxes with a large piece of flint, several fire steel bars and tinder were available for purchase through Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue . The flint and steel could also be sold separately, as well as packs of "instant fire starters" containing only tinder and flint.</p>
