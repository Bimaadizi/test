<p>The Realm of Wailing Fog was a mysterious land found on the eastern edge of the Hullack Forest and west of the Thunder Peaks mountain range in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The realm was a collection of permanently mist-covered secluded fens with eerie calls echoing through it. By the 14 th century DR , the misty wetland hid long-ruined towers. Everyone who traversed the Hullack Forest or passed along the East Way that curved south towards the nearby Realm of Wailing Fog, testified of a strange and sinister feeling of being watched.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the century that followed the Spellplague , the magical chaos did not affect the Realm of Wailing Fog. The land remade a forbidding mystery. None dared enter the Realm, not even the Eldreth Veluuthra . In the 15 th century DR, there were unsubstantiated rumors that claimed that the Realm of Wailing Fog was home to a coven of hags .</p>
