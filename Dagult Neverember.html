<p>Dagult Neverember was the wealthy Lord Protector of Neverwinter and formerly the Open Lord of Waterdeep as of the late 15 th century DR . He was a member of the Lords' Alliance and one of the most powerful and well-respected men on the entire Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Neverember was tall, broad-shouldered, and strikingly good-looking, with angular features, a mane of silver-flecked "pumpkin-brown" hair, and deep-set but shining dark eyes. He was often called a "lion of a man" for both his appearance and bearing, and was said to have the look of a strong ruler.</p>
<p>By the end of his tenure as Open Lord, Neverember sported a short but thick beard that had gone grey.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A consummate politician, Neverember was a capable and inspiring leader who was known to be both brave and stately in the face of opposition. He outwardly embodied the ideals of moderation, honesty, and responsibility. He always acted decisively and firmly, with a clear-eyed view of the costs and sacrifices that his decisions entailed, although his cunning and brutal pragmatism had earned him the nickname "Dagger" Neverember. He was also ambitious, proud, manipulative, and considered himself to be superior to everyone else—which made him overconfident —and his quick temper was known to interfere with his judgment, making him boisterous and dangerous. However, his charisma, affability, flair for diplomacy, eloquence, and general preference for straight dealings rather than intrigue all meant that people considered him easy to like, and he made a point of befriending nearly everyone he met. Laeral Silverhand , Dagult's successor as Open Lord, once described him as a no-nonsense, energetic, and practical person.</p>
<p>While he did have Waterdeep's and Neverwinter's best interests at heart, he frequently attempted to personally profit from the people's good fortune. In private, Neverember could be disrespectful to his subordinates, although he was always diplomatic in public. He admired wit and strength in others, and he expected and rewarded order and discipline. He was an intelligent and calculating opportunist, and always made a point to outwardly appear disinterested in scandals or rumors while silently cataloguing and assessing the pros and cons of every person or piece of information he encountered. Ultimately, he was results-oriented above all else, and was ruthless in his tireless pursuit of his goals. He was not above resorting to crimes like embezzlement or assassination to secure his positions, although once he had solidified his power in the late 1480s DR, he strove never to engage in outwardly illegal acts (however he was still known to seek out creative or "forgotten" legal justifications when he needed them). He was adept at identifying potential allies, especially those with flexible morals or those who were skilled at acting with discretion.</p>
<p>Neverember was rarely seen without a stiff drink in hand. He enjoyed heavy drinking, especially when it involved conversing with successful male adventurers or flirting with successful female adventurers. He was notorious for his shameless and outrageous flirtations with beautiful women.</p>
<p>He had a morbid fascination with the effects of the Spellplague , which included a healthy fear of its dangers. At one point, he outlawed the presence of spellscarred individuals within Neverwinter.</p>
<p>Neverember did not back down from a fight, and would hurl taunts at his opponents in combat. It was said that every Waterdhavian man of a certain age had grown up wanting to train with him.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Neverember wore colorful and extravagant clothes, including vests lined with ermine fur, cloaks made of velvet , shirts of silk from Shou Lung , and high boots of crimson Aglarondan leather . As Open Lord of Waterdeep, he wore a heavy medallion to indicate his position, and as Lord Protector of Neverwinter, he dressed in blues and golds and would wear gleaming plate or chain mail armor. He always wore his signet ring and he both carried a longsword and kept a dagger hidden in his sleeve. He possessed an undisclosed means to protect himself from scrying , which caused magical backlash against spellcasters attempting to spy on him.</p>
<p>He resided at a grand manor in Waterdeep (although technically it belonged to his wife) and also owned a "modest" villa in Neverwinter, from where he conducted much of his official business. He maintained a large stash of alcohol, including drugged wine in case a need for it arose.</p>
<p>He owned multiple ships , including a prized caravel called Neverwinter's Pride .</p>
<p>In his office at Castle Waterdeep and at his old headquarters in the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter, Neverember kept a number of valuable (even priceless) artifacts. Among these were Ahghairon's Key (which found and opened any locked door within range) and one of the eleven fragments of the Staff of Waterdeep (a fake in his office and the real piece at his manor). He was also in possession of the Crown of Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Neverember's goals could be somewhat enigmatic. While he acted in the best interests of his subjects, he always prioritized ways to enrich himself. In his role as Lord Protector of Neverwinter, he worked diligently to repair and rebuild the city, attract new inhabitants, facilitate trade, and ensure security. His ambition was for the city to surpass Waterdeep in grandeur. He was also highly motivated to maintain his grip on power, and ensured that even if he lost his political power, he would still retain leverage over Neverwinter's economy.</p>
<p>While he took his role at Lord Protector of Neverwinter seriously, he had little interest in the day-to-day operations of his government, and delegated these tasks. Whenever something went wrong, he was quick to pin the blame on one of his subordinates, and then try to position himself as a champion of the people as he made an example of that subordinate.</p>
<p>Neverember was noted as a legendarily shrewd negotiator and an accomplished orator. His primary political strategy for gaining the support of Neverwinter's population was to drum up nationalistic emotions, followed closely by the promise that only he could keep them safe. He was largely successful at ingratiating himself with the populace, but he was keenly aware that any attempt to claim a title more grand than "Lord Protector" would quickly lose him the support of the people, who largely saw him as a foreigner until quite late in the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>Neverember was a member of the noble Neverember family, and claimed to be a descendant of Vers Never , the supposed bastard son of Nasher Alagondar and brother to Bann Alagondar , who served as Neverwinter's first kings. In order to cement his relations to the royal line, Neverember paid scribes to find or create books that gave legitimacy to his birthright, and to burn any books that cast doubts on it. One such scribe was Retrigal Bookbinder . However, there was enough genealogical data left intact to prove that his claim of lineage was completely fabricated, as discovered by the Neverwintan aristocrat, Indrina Lamsensettle .</p>
<p>The relationship with his son, Renaer , was estranged and complicated, eventually turning into mutual animosity. During his time as Open Lord, it was rumored that he had left Renaer in charge of managing his properties, although his son frequently chafed at his father's wishes and expectations. Even so, Neverember was said to have shown a certain pride in his son's actions and good heart, even calling him a "hero" at one point.</p>
<p>His wife had been a member of the noble Brandarth family of Waterdeep. Dagult had married her for her money, but when she passed away, she left everything to Renaer instead, which contributed to Dagult's rocky relationship with his son. Her will also stipulated that Dagult was not allowed to fire the halfling servants at his manor, whom Dagult vocally disliked for "sneaking" around the house. Most of his abuse was heaped on his halfling butler, Madrak . As a rule, all of his servants saw him as a terror, and knew that he expected them to do what he wanted before he asked.</p>
<p>While Open Lord, Neverember had a lover in Kalain , an eccentric half-elf painter. He had at least one other secret paramour, and also often flirted with and sent valuable gifts to Talanna Taenfeather , although she apparently was not his lover. Even in old age, he was widely regarded as a desirable bachelor.</p>
<h3>Political</h3>
<p>Prior to his ouster as Open Lord, Neverember was closely allied with House Margaster of Waterdeep, and was especially close with Inkeri Margaster . After his ouster, Neverember despised the nobility and guilds of Waterdeep for their perceived betrayal, and deeply resented Laeral Silverhand for taking his position, although this sentiment was not mutual as Laeral appreciated his efforts to restore Waterdeep during his time as Open Lord. Regardless, Neverember preferred to hire adventurers and mercenaries to protect Neverwinter and train the local troops rather than accept the help of the armies of the Lords of Waterdeep , who had deposed him as Open Lord. Even so, he tried to avoid letting his feelings cloud his judgment whenever he had to fulfill his duties as a member of the Lords' Alliance.</p>
<p>The Harpers viewed Neverember's ambitions in Neverwinter as tyrannical and imperialistic. They spied on him, and even acquired letters of debts that he owed. They were also involved in organizing resistance against his rule in its early years, including leadership roles with the Sons of Alagondar , a faction explicitly aligned against the Lord Protector and any right of his to rule the city of Neverwinter. These rebels dubbed him the "Lord Pretender" and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Neverember was known to be brutal in his reprisals against the Sons.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dagult was known to be a good friend to the Emerald Enclave and supported the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood . Under Dagult, Neverwintans practiced sensible logging practices there.</p>
<p>Neverember was initially on good terms with the Ashmadai , although this was at least in part because he did not truly understand who they were, who they worshiped , or the threat that they posed to his regime, and he would eventually declare them to be his enemies. Likewise, he had several dealings with Shadovar agents, but was generally unaware of their true allegiance or the threat that they posed to Neverwinter. By contrast, he was aware of and opposed to the activities of agents from Thay in and around Neverwinter, although he would subsequently advocate for an alliance with the Red Wizards when practicality demanded it.</p>
<p>Neverember was a fierce political opponent of Luskan 's secret leader, Jarlaxle , and was an obstacle to the drow's designs to get Luskan admitted to the Lords' Alliance. He was also on poor terms with King Bruenor Battlehammer of Gauntlgrym , with both sides regarding the other as greedy and untrustworthy. This rivalry kept Gauntlgrym isolated from potential trade with both Neverwinter and Waterdeep for as long as Neverember ruled both.</p>
<p>Neverember's most reliable agents were his mercenary general, Sabine , and his lackey Soman Galt , who served as mayor of Neverwinter during its rebuilding. He also had a number of advisors in Neverwinter, including Drijm Stoneaxe , Sudbury , Shay Morningstar , and Silwen Wiltfen . His Master of Trade and personal accountant in Neverwinter was Len-jes . He had ties to the Zhentarim via an advisor named Rian Nightshade , and while he did not advertise this relationship, neither did he see a need to deny it if asked. Additionally, through the exchange of favors, trust, and coin, Neverember had managed to secure a network of faithful loyalists. These included Liset Cheldar , the owner of the Moonstone Mask in Neverwinter; Harrag , the proprietor of the Beached Leviathan in Neverwinter; Agada Vane , a shopkeeper and spy in Waterdeep; Dalakhar , a dedicated rock gnome spy; Nazra Mrays , a shrewd socialite and intelligence gatherer in Waterdeep; and many Neverwintian politicians who had agreed to support him. He was not above working with criminals, but he preferred that they at least pretend to be lawful or reformed. He was known to reward his best mercenaries and adventurers with large homes in Neverwinter.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Dagult Neverember was born into the noble Neverember family in the Year of Ten Terrors, 1429 DR . He grew up in Neverwinter, and even from a young age, he began to dream about creating a mercantile empire for himself. At some point he moved to Waterdeep and firmly established himself there, so much so that the people of Neverwinter did not see him as one of their own when he eventually returned.</p>
<p>From Waterdeep, he achieved his goal of building a mercantile empire, and became obscenely rich and thus influential. At some point, Neverember began to invest heavily in the island of Mintarn , where he founded a ship-building company as well as facilities to train mercenaries. He also bankrolled the White Sails company, which grew to become the biggest Tarnian provider of soldiers and ships for hire.</p>
<p>In Waterdeep, he married into the noble Brandarth family, adding his wife's broad property holdings and wealth to his own. She bore him a son, Renaer, before dying when the boy was still in his youth and leaving everything to him instead of to Dagult.</p>
<p>Neverember became the Open Lord of Waterdeep circa the Year of the Three Heroes United, 1467 DR . By this time, he had become one of the richest men in the city, and thanks to both his resources and his political acumen, Waterdeep began to thrive after years of neglect. Not all went smoothly, however. In an unpopular move among the nobility, he instituted a law that allowed for a limited number of Waterdhavian titles to be bought and sold. He personally organized the sale of many noble titles to potential allies in exchange for the promise that he could rely on their support in the future, while also profiting in the present. He also immediately implemented a tax on all residents of the city, requiring them to pay one shard each month when the City Guard came knocking. Furthermore, within a year he had lost most of the City Navy after sending them to hunt Northlander pirates, and so hired a fleet of Tarnian mercenary ships to replace them (and proceeded to profit from spending Waterdeep's funds to hire companies in which he was an investor).</p>
<h3>Lord Protector of Neverwinter</h3>
<p>In the Year of the First Circle, 1468 DR , Neverember turned his attention to the ruined city of Neverwinter, which had been destroyed when Mount Hotenow erupted about 16 years earlier . He started the " New Neverwinter " movement to rebuild the city, claiming himself to be the "Lord Protector of Neverwinter". This role was commonly understood to be one of stewardship, with the recognition that he would legally step down if an heir to the Alagondar line of Neverwintian kings came forward to claim their throne. However, Neverember aimed to prove that he himself was a descendant of Neverwinter's former kings and thus a rightful king of Neverwinter. To lend credence to his claims, Neverember invested a great deal of his own personal fortune to rebuild the city's infrastructure, buy the interest of merchants, keep the city safe by employing an army of Tarnian mercenaries, and even ensure that Neverwintian refugees had enough food and gold in hand. Within a decade, a steady flow of refugees were returning to the city and Neverember had turned himself into the linchpin of Neverwinter's stability by providing Neverwintians with ever-improving security, work, and access to goods.</p>
<p>Neverember's true intentions were popularly understood to be imperialistic, and his efforts to increase the prosperity of the city were in order to gain the favor and love of the Neverwintians so that they would welcome him as their king in the future, thus transforming Neverwinter into the center of his powerful mercantile empire. While he was quite popular with refugees who returned to the city under his watch, Neverember's army of Tarnian "peacekeepers" soon aggravated many locals, notably among those who hadn't fled the city following the Ruining . In addition to his army of mercenaries, Neverember also paid for an army of carpenters, stonemasons, and artisans to rebuild Neverwinter. To spur economic growth, he implemented a policy of few regulations on trade and low taxes on imported goods, hoping to attract back former residents as well as merchants from across Faerûn . This largely succeeded, and as the city grew, he took a keen mercantile interest in the trade and visitors coming and going via the docks. By the end of the 1470s DR, the docks had been rebuilt fully (at the cost of every tree on the Upland Rise north of the city) and a steep tariff had been imposed on incoming merchant ships.</p>
<p>Shortly after his arrival in the city, Neverember began prioritizing a fortification known as the Wall to keep his New Neverwinter operation safe and to protect his base of operations at the Hall of Justice, a former temple to the then-dead god Tyr , that he had selected largely because of its emotional significance to the people of Neverwinter. To make his occupation of the old temple more palatable to the locals, he initially staffed it with priests of Torm to create the illusion that he was rededicating it to a still-living god. In the Year of the Fourth Circle, 1474 DR , Neverember announced the completion of his " Protector's Enclave ", a section in the southwest of Neverwinter that he declared to be (mostly) rebuilt and as safe as any other city. While it was more secure than the rest of the ruins—it was protected by the Wall and was centered on the Hall of Justice—it was also a veritable police state under the strict control of Neverember and his mercenaries who patrolled the streets, his spies who kept the residents in line, and his tax collectors who kept the operation funded. Any defiance or opposition against Neverember's rule was swiftly, and often violently, repressed within the Protector's Enclave. This ultimately led to the rise of the Sons of Alagondar, an underground movement associated with the Harpers, who were dedicated to resisting Neverember's reign in Neverwinter, fearing that his imperialistic goals would not aid the people of the city in the long run.</p>
<p>At some point, Lord Neverember banned the High Sun Games that were being held in the city, considering them brutal. For example, in the final Games, one contestant made it to the last round, only to be half-eaten by a remorhaz .</p>
<p>Neverember increasingly began to spend most of his time in Neverwinter, and left much of the day-to-day running of Waterdeep to his trusted lieutenants, including clerks and bureaucrats loyal to him personally and allies among the Lords of Waterdeep. He traveled to Waterdeep only irregularly, meaning his visits were hectic affairs in which he dealt with long-delayed legal and governance decisions as well as a flurry of meetings and events, including speeches, conferences with nobles and merchants, and summary court rulings. He was known to handle matters important to the city without communicating with the other Lords of Waterdeep, often using stalling tactics to keep them out of his way. Amidst all of this, he still found time for womanizing in Waterdeep, including a year-long torrid romance with Kalain, an artist whom he met when she painted his portrait in the Year of the Final Stand, 1475 DR . When he was busy with his new duties in Waterdeep, he left the day-to-day running of Neverwinter to General Sabine and Mayor Soman Galt.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Purloined Statue, 1477 DR , news was finally beginning to spread that Neverwinter was rebuilding, and Neverember had put out a call to invite back all who had fled following Mount Hotenow's eruption.</p>
<h3>Threats and Rivals</h3>
<p>In the Year of the Dark Circle, 1478 DR , upon returning to Neverwinter from a trip to Waterdeep, Neverember survived an assassination attempt led by his Neverwintian spymaster Dhafiyand , who was secretly a member of the Red Wizards of Thay and who had acquired the legendary Crown of Neverwinter . Neverember was saved thanks to the efforts of one of his agents, Rucas Sarfael , and the aid of several members of the Sons of Alagondar who sought the Crown for themselves, but the affair ended with the Crown in Neverember's possession. It was said that the Lord Protector protested against his mercenary bodyguards' efforts to keep him safe during the attack, wishing to fight his enemies head-on. He also gave a rousing speech to onlookers once his former spymaster lay dead at his feet.</p>
<p>His focus in Neverwinter at this time was split between fully reclaiming the Blacklake District and defending the people from both Many-Arrows orcs occupying the city's northeast and plaguechanged horrors—sent by the Abolethic Sovereignty —rising from the Chasm in the city's southeast. Despite great investment to ensure the city's security, Neverwinter was far from safe. Also in 1478 DR, he proclaimed the " Protector's Law ", a controversial decree that any and all spellscarred or plaguechanged individuals were to be expelled from Neverwinter and sent to Helm's Hold . This was accompanied by Neverember sending mercenaries to help police the town, and he quickly established sufficient political influence that the town could do little except acquiesce to his whims.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , many in Waterdeep felt that Neverember was abusing his power, using the City Watch for his personal errands, and wielding his influence to waive penalties for his son's reckless escapades. That year, he conspired with Khondar "Ten-Rings" Naomal to find the Overlord's Helm in order to find out the secrets of his fellow Lords of Waterdeep, but this relationship disintegrated when the full extent of Khondar's plans to establish wizards as the rulers of Waterdeep became known. Furthermore, his constant focus on Neverwinter caused concern among Waterdhavians, although he assured them that his efforts were meant to bring Neverwinter under Waterdeep's influence.</p>
<p>Also in 1479 DR, a self-proclaimed " Lost Heir " of the Alagondar bloodline seemingly wearing the Crown of Neverwinter made public their claim to the throne of Neverwinter, rallying the support of the Sons of Alagondar and quickly turning public opinion against Neverember and his "tyrannical ambitions" for the city. For his part, the Lord Protector claimed that he would be happy to hand over the city to a legitimate heir, but openly questioned the Lost Heir's methods, secrecy, and refusal to parlay. Privately, he had no desire to give up the city in which he had invested so much, and so he instructed General Sabine to hire a group of adventurers to track down the so-called heir and discover their true intentions. This Lost Heir was ultimately revealed to be a fraud wearing a false Crown of Neverwinter . However, the real Crown was stolen that same year following the Thayan-led Siege of Neverwinter when members of the Nashers —a splinter faction of the Sons of Alagondar—plotted to place their leader, Arlon Bladeshaper , on the throne.</p>
<p>Even after the Crown was recovered, Neverember would subsequently fend off yet another pretender to the throne in the wizard Gyrion and his Cloaked Ascendancy , who also produced a false Crown and used it to rally the Nashers against him. Neverember would take an increasingly aggressive stance toward tracking down and eliminating any descendants of the Alagondars with stronger claims to the throne than himself. In addition, he hired groups of volunteer rangers and adventurers to take care of other issues relating to the security of Neverwinter and the surrounding region, including slaying Mordai Vell , leader of the Ashmadai, and recovering an artifact known as the Talon of Umberlee , which was believed to have the power to protect the city against threats from the sea. He also sent troops to garrison points north of the city, including Rothé Valley and Raven Cliff Beach .</p>
<p>Eventually, the many threats faced by Neverwinter—including the Many-Arrows orcs, the Thayans, and the horrors of the Chasm—were brought under control, leading Neverember to institute public celebrations such as an annual jubilee and the festival of the Masquerade of Liars . He also celebrated the opening of new trade relations with Icewind Dale and New Sharandar .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR , Neverember, along with General Sabine and Jelvus Grinch , met with Bruenor Battlehammer and Emerus Warcrown in Neverwinter to discuss the reclamation of Gauntlgrym from the drow . Neverember had been hiring adventurers to seek out the underground city for over seven years, hoping to rebuild it as his own, but the dwarves had brought an army to his doorstep to demand he relinquish any claim to Gauntlgrym's riches. Caught by surprise and left with no leverage, Neverember was merely able to insist that any new dwarven realm's borders would not touch the surface, and thus any trade in or out of Gauntlgrym could be taxed by him. Once the dwarves had secured the city, tensions remained high between Gauntlgrym and Neverember.</p>
<h3>Ousted from Waterdeep</h3>
<p>During his tenure as Open Lord, Neverember took advantage of several opportunities to enrich himself and to further his goals in Neverwinter at Waterdeep's expense. He hired mercenary companies in which he was an investor, used Waterdhavian soldiers and laborers to rebuild the High Road to Neverwinter (at the expense of Waterdeep's own construction needs), and—most egregiously—embezzled large sums of money. In one scheme, he stole half a million dragons from Waterdeep's coffers, and to conceal this sum, he made an arrangement with the gold dragon Aurinax : in exchange for the Dragonstaff of Ahghairon , Aurinax would guard the gold until Neverember wanted it back. For secrecy, he then removed the information about the gold's secret location from his mind, and stored it in an artifact known as the Stone of Golorr . In the summer of the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant, 1487 DR , Neverember participated in a separate year-long scheme to launder another million gold pieces—mostly in platinum —out of Waterdeep with the aid of House Margaster: he "purchased" the ruined keep of Thornhold from the Margasters for a paltry sum of 40,000 gold pieces , and House Margaster arranged to have the million funneled from Waterdeep to Neverwinter under the ruse of Clan Stoneshaft purchasing the Thornhold deed from Neverember. Following the completion of this scheme in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR , Neverember would also support an invasion of Luskan by the Margasters in exchange for the laundered money.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Neverember ordered soldiers to reclaim the ruined town of Leilon that lay between Neverwinter and Waterdeep on the High Road. Shrewdly, he ensured that all those responsible for rebuilding the town would be loyal to him personally. By spring of 1488 DR, rumblings of the Waterdhavians' frustrations with his rule had already spread far and wide.</p>
<p>Neverember was increasingly seen as a tyrannical ruler in Waterdeep, and circa the Year of the Warrior Princess, 1489 DR , he was facing several political scandals. With his resources stretched thin between rebuilding Neverwinter and maintaining influence in Waterdeep, it was at this time that the Masked Lords of Waterdeep decided to replace him as Open Lord in favor of Laeral Silverhand. Prior to his ouster, Neverember led the Council of Waterdeep —an alliance meant to stand against the rise of the Cult of the Dragon threatening the North —which had further made him not only ruler of Neverwinter and Waterdeep, but leader of the entire Lords' Alliance. Thus, the loss of his status as Open Lord hit him particularly hard as it also cost him his place of leadership on the Council. Even so, he continued to join the meetings and to pledge his and Neverwinter's support for the fight against the Cult, hoping to restore his honor by demonstrating the strength of his leadership. He remained a voice of pragmatism on the Council, even supporting unsavory tactics such as forming an alliance with the Red Wizards.</p>
<p>The decision to depose Neverember from the Open Lordship occurred while he was in Neverwinter and effectively exiled him from Waterdeep, thus severing his connections to his assets in that city, which included the hoard of money he had embezzled and the Stone of Golorr , which had been hidden in the Palace of Waterdeep . Many of his loyal clerks left alongside him, leaving Waterdeep's bureaucracy short-staffed.</p>
<h3>Refocus on Neverwinter</h3>
<p>Having been ousted as Open Lord of Waterdeep, Neverember focused all of his efforts in his role of Lord Protector of Neverwinter, continuing to rebuild the city, revive Neverwinter's economy, and secure his grip on power. Slowly but surely, Neverwinter had begun to return to being a center of civilization on the Sword Coast under his stewardship. However, bitter over his expulsion from Waterdeep, Neverember became more despotic and began to enforce more heavy-handed laws in Neverwinter. Blaming the nobles and guilds of Waterdeep for betraying him, he enacted high taxes and harsh regulations to constrain the Neverwintian nobility and abolish any Neverwintian guilds in an effort to stifle all political competition. This soon became a strategy of scapegoating the city's wealthy for all of Neverwinter's ails, a message that he found resonated well with the poorer citizens, but perhaps complicated his efforts to attract wealthy families from Waterdeep to invest and settle in the city.</p>
<p>The continued demand for construction work to rebuild the city served to funnel more coin into the pockets of poorer residents, earning Neverember greater popularity among them. At some point, his seemingly bottomless pockets had begun to run dry, perhaps leading to the ever-steeper taxes he imposed on Neverwinter's aristocrats and rich merchants. He also began the process of training local Neverwintians to form their own army and city watch, known as the Wintershield watchmen , in order to reduce his reliance on paying Tarnian mercenaries. This also had the benefit of being quite popular with the citizenry, who still resented being policed by foreign soldiers. Furthermore, he managed to finally coordinate the closing of the Chasm in the heart of the city, and—in an apparent show of humility—he moved his office into his private home and gifted the Hall of Justice to followers of Tyr to restore as a temple. These actions made him an even more worthy leader in the eyes of the Neverwintians.</p>
<p>Due to this commitment and his many accomplishments helping the city and its citizens, the people of Neverwinter finally accepted him as the rightful leader of their city, despite the fact that people from other lands saw him as a tyrant. While he still faced opposition, even many of the Sons of Alagondar eventually began to join him to help replace the ranks of mercenaries. However, he was still not recognized as a king or heir to the throne, and so throughout this period, Neverember continued to seek the death of any other person who claimed to be a descendant of the Alagondar family.</p>
<p>In a testament to Neverember's immense influence at this time, his ouster from Waterdeep combined with his draw down of mercenaries from Mintarn led to a crisis on the island nation as much of their reliable income dried up. At the same time, Neverember had stopped contributing to the payment of tribute to the red dragon Hoondarrh , exposing the island realm to a greater threat from the beast. Needless to say, the Tarnians largely saw this as a betrayal.</p>
<p>Resentment and suspicion of the former Open Lord remained rampant in Waterdeep, and some believed he intended to start a war to regain control of the city. When a number of the Lords of Waterdeep were murdered in the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , Neverember was immediately and unjustly accused of the deeds as people believed he wanted to take revenge on them over his exile. When Laeral asked him about this—using a spell to commune with him from Waterdeep and to read his mind in the process—she learned that Neverember was innocent, and he in turn learned that she wished for friendlier relations with Neverwinter. Nevertheless, mistrust of Neverember remained high in Waterdeep, and spies were sent to keep an eye on his activities.</p>
<p>Around this time, work on resettling Leilon neared completion. Neverember remained the de facto ruler of the town, with Neverwintian soldiers occupying it—led by Sergeant Hazz Yorrum —and rebuilding efforts being overseen by his agents—notably Grizzelda Copperwraught and Valdi Estapaar . Despite this, he still insisted that the settlers pay for the privilege of his troops securing the High Road between Leilon and Neverwinter. Following the Battle of Leilon , in which the townsfolk fended off an assault from two cults dedicated to Talos and Myrkul , Neverember took a more active role in the area's defense by posting large bounties on Leilon's enemies.</p>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Neverember sent his spies, among them the rock gnome Dalakhar, to Waterdeep to retrieve the Stone of Golorr . None of them succeeded, and the Stone instead fell into the hands of others. This led to rumors swirling about the extent of Neverember's malfeasance as factions like the Zhentarim and the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild rushed to claim the stolen money for themselves.</p>
<p>When Indrina Lamsensettle , a noblewoman and actress, assembled genealogical information which proved that Neverember was not legitimately descended from Nasher Alagondar, she feared that he would seek to make her disappear. However, by this time he was confident enough in his position to casually dismiss her claim as lacking evidence.</p>
<p>As of the Year of the Duplicitous Courtier, 1496 DR , Neverember was known as the man who had brought peace and stability to a mostly rebuilt Neverwinter. By then, he held autocratic power over the city, and his focus had turned to restoring Castle Never to its former glory. To accomplish this, he had begun imposing new income taxes on merchants and adventuring companies , and would sentence tax evaders to imprisonment and death in " the holes ".</p>

<p>For all of his power, Lord Neverember suddenly took ill in the late 1490s DR, causing him to slip into a vegetative state. The previously unknown Forge Fitzwilliam seized upon this opportunity and waged a political campaign for lordship of Neverwinter, describing Neverwinter's leaders as "corrupt and inept" and financing his bid for lordship using his own ill-gotten fortune. He was aided by the wizard Sofina , his top advisor, whom it was rumored had caused Neverember's sickness with her magic. Once Forge ascended to lordship over Neverwinter, he soon revived the High Sun Games that Dagult had previously banned, much to the excitement of the people. He also ordered destructive logging of Neverwinter Wood as part of reprisals against the elves and the Emerald Enclave for questioning his legitimacy.</p>
<p>Forge would eventually be revealed as not only a conman scheming to use his position to steal from wealthy marks, but a co-conspirator in a plot by Sofina and Szass Tam to transform the attendees of the High Sun Games into undead minions of the Red Wizards of Thay. However, this plot was foiled by a group of thieves-turned-heroes: Edgin Darvis , Holga Kilgore , Simon Aumar , Doric , and Forge's fomer ward Kira . With the Red Wizard Sofina subdued and her magic negated, Neverember awoke from his coma and once again assumed lordship over the city. His first official act was to award medals of heroism to the five heroes and to pardon Darvis and Kilgore, who were both on the run after breaking out of the Revel's End prison. His second act was to grant formal protections to the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood and their land as well as to the Emerald Enclave. Meanwhile, the fleeing Forge Fitzwilliam was apprehended by the paladin Xenk Yendar , and was sent to Revel's End.</p>
