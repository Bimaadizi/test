<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary Umar Witch . Erlin and his wife Enna Hendrick fled their distant farm in fear of the dreaded witch and stayed within the Imnesvale. They brought their seven favorite chickens over to the village. The chickens were not pets but rather the couple's future meals. Curiously enough, one of the chickens they brought over to Imnesvale had swallowed a precious beljuril gemstone that was still inside it.</p>
