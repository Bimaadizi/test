This led said owner to become somewhat worried; he contacted the War Wizards to see to additional security, as the security he hired kept accepting bribes from the nobles intending to attend.</p>
<p>An altercation resulted from the convergence of numerous murderous blueflame ghosts , sent by Cymmarra and Lord Calantar during the performance.</p>
