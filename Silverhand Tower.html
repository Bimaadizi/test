<p>Silverhand Tower was the primary residence of Dornal Silverhand in the mid–8 th century DR . It was also the birthplace of the Seven Sisters .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tower stood in a wooded dell near the city of Neverwinter and nearer the site of would later be the location of Longsaddle .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Silverhand Tower was little more than a cottage attached to an empty ring of battlements on a collapsed keep by the 760s DR. There was a small vegetable garden nearby, and presumably a stream and a stump both visible from the cottage.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Dornal Silverhand and Elué Shundar got married, they moved to Silverhand Tower, where Dornal's senile mother welcomed Elué as the "sorceress in the moonlight" of her dreams ere passing away. Dornal and Elue lived in the tower where they had a new daughter every year, starting with Anastra Syluné in 761 DR and Alustriel in 762 DR .</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Dornal, upon learning his wife's transformation into something ever closer to a lich was due to possession by some entity of overwhelming power, murdered his wife and fled the lands. Their six daughters were orphaned, which prompted Mystra to send her Chosen , Elminster Aumar , to look after the little girls.</p>
