<p>Forgefires was a small dwarven stronghold located in Fimbrul , Laerakond .</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The dwarves of Forgefires were xenophobic and only allowed other dwarves to enter in their domain. Even so, unfamiliar dwarves were treated with suspicion as well.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Forgefires was built in tunnels too small for giants or dragons to enter them. The stronghold had hundreds of hidden tunnels and doors, and the deeper cellars were located in volcanic rifts where the dwarves forged all manner of stuff.</p>
