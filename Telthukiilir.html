<p>A telthukiilir (or "high seeing orb" ) was an extremely powerful version of a crystal ball .</p>
<p>It was lit faintly from within, emanating emerald-colored light. By speaking a command, the large orb could show the whereabouts of any individual. It was capable of scrying even through powerful magical barriers, but its more powerful abilities used its charge more rapidly, and it took time to recover from this.</p>
<p>Sarya Dlardrageth recovered a telthukiilir originating from Aryvandaar from the ruins of Nar Kerymhoarth .</p>
