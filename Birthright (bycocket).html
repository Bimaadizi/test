<p>Birthright was an enchanted and fancifully embroidered bycocket hat designed to magically boost the wearer's charisma.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once adorning a wearer's head, Birthright magically affected their appearance and charisma, making them more appealing, pleasant, and charming. This magic was especially useful for warlocks , bards , and sorcerers as their command of the Weave did not come from their natural wisdom or sharpness of the mind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Birthright was in stock at Sorcerous Sundries , a wizard's shop in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate , where it was sold by the proprietor's magical simulacrum or by his tiefling clerk named Rolan .</p>
