<p>The Airsteppers Guild was a messenger guild of windsoul genasi that operated in Airspur , Akanûl , in the late years of the 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Activitties</h2>
<p>Due to the vertical nature of Airspur, travel throughout the city was challenging. However, windsoul genasi could levitate over short distances and float and thus made excellent couriers. Guild members wore blue and white robes and followed a strict code of secrecy.</p>
<p>As of 1479 DR , the Airsteppers, as they were called, were often employed by Queen Arathane and the Four Stewards , usually to work as guards or decoys, as they were known for their adherence to the guild's rules, though a few individuals were corrupt enough to be hired by the Stewards Magnol and Myxofin for intel gathering.</p>
