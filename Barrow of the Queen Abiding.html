<p>The Barrow of the Queen Abiding was a Narfelli vault within the Rawlinswood of the Great Dale holding the Queen Abiding , a demon bound by the ancient Nar . It was disturbed by Fallon in 1373Â DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>Per the Rotting Man , the Barrow of the Queen Abiding was connected to the Arches of Xenosi and to the rest of the catacombs around Dun-Tharos .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Close to the Arches of Xenosi, a single flight of stairs was hidden beneath a weedy mound. These led down to a landing; the landing led through a straight tunnel into a larger chamber with a cylindrical block of almost-black ice in the middle. This was the prison of the Queen Abiding . This chamber had its walls and ceiling covered in brittle, dark ice veins, while the floor was covered in ice just rough enough to gain purchase.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The landing, tunnel, and the chamber were all unnaturally cold, likely due to the power of the Queen Abiding; the walls were themselves covered in eldritch frost and ice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , both the group of Fallon and Araluen , and the party pursuing them, consisting of Marrec , Elowen , Gunggari Ulmarra , and Ususi Manaallin , crossed through the Barrow of the Queen Abiding. Though she took notice of Fallon and Araluen, her forces only stirred to action in response to the second party.</p>
