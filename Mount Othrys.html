<p>Mount Othrys Geography Type Mountain Elevation 50 mi (80 km) Society Races Greater Titans Mount Othrys was a massive mountain in the Othrys layer of Carceri that was well known for being the home of the imprisoned Greater Titans , but was also the divine realm of their ruler, Cronus .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Mount Othrys stood 50 miles (80 kilometers) tall and was made up of two conjoined mountains, each of which stood on a different one of the layer's orbs, their highest peaks nearly touching. Like all of the orbs on the layer of Othrys, these were 100 miles (160 kilometers) apart from each other.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The Titans encouraged the development of many creatures on Mount Othrys, many of which were similar to those found on Olympus . They made special pets of many of these creatures and would exact vengeance upon any who slayed them. One such creature was the Othrysian dodecahydra .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>There were no settlements on Mount Othrys, only a massive palace and amphitheaters of white marble in disrepair that stood at where its two peaks met, though there were also small hostels that regularly popped up around the structure's entrances. Separate from the rest of the layer of Othrys, the palace maintained its own plane of gravity. At the center of the palace stood Cronus's throne room, which measured a 1 mi (1.6 km) wide.</p>
<p>The structures on Mount Othrys were twisted echoes of the edifices found on Olympus, the plane where their marble and the Greater Titans both originated from. Their state of disrepair came gradually as the Titans inhabited Carceri, but due to their imprisoned state no additional marble could be obtained to make repairs. Being a delipidated, unrepairable echo of what they once had on Olympus, the structures caused the Titans both great frustration and pain, serving as a constant reminder of their lost glory. They were liable to destroy anyone that drew their attention to the state of disrepair, even if it was done as an offer to import marble for them.</p>
<h2>Notable Inhabitants</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the month of Hammer , in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves transported to the plane of Tarterus after defending the githzerai fortress of Tah'Darr from a tanar'ri incursion. At the urgings of the fallen paladin Elendil , the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to their Prime Material world of Toril . When they first entered the crumbling palace they were greeted by a 50 ft (15 m) tall marble pillar, with a column of twenty spears jammed down one crack, each impaled with the severed head of a man. They were then approached by the titan responsible, Chiron , who demanded tribute from them in exchange for an audience with his father. Chiron informed the group that tanar'ri were visiting his father and advised them not to comment on the disrepair of the palacee as it was considered rude.</p>
<p>Eventually the group made their way to Cronus, deep into some kind of Cosmic Game with the marilith Cucathne , the latter of whom was entertaining the Titan with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr. Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.</p>
