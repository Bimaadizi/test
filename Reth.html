<p>Reth was one of the largest and most powerful city-states in the Vilhon Reach . It also was one of five free cities located in the Chondath region of the Vilhon Reach in Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reth was a high-walled fast-growing trading port city of Chessenta . One of its most renowned structures was a grand amphitheater rivaled only by one in Manshaka . The amphitheater was used as a gladiatorial arena that hosted battles twice per tenday.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Reth laid at the westernmost coastal border of Chessenta and close to the Akanapeaks to its south. One of the very few passages across Akanapeaks was the Gap of Reth that connected the city with Airspur that, by the mid-14 th century DR , fell under Reth's control. The Gap of Reth was located behind a sizable gate that protected the city from dangers of the savage inhabitants of the Akanapeaks.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Before the Rotting War , Reth's power was in the hands of the governor. Several centuries after Chondath fell apart, Reth's governmening was put in the hands of the council of merchants, the so-called Lords of Reth. The council of merchants leader was wizard Murzig Hekkatayn circa 1357 DR .</p>
<p>By the 1370s DR, Reth was governed by an elected Mayor and Seven Senators. Each of the Senators held absolute power in their aspect of the government. These aspects were: Public Works, Defense, Trade, Games, Economy, Justice, and Relations.</p>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>Chessenta , as well as the city of Reth, followed the revised version of Unther 's Code of Enlil . According to it, any individual accused of piracy (or other capital crime) had a right to defend themselves in front of a court and a jury. The conviction was always done after the jury reached the verdict unanimously. Smuggling was considered a major crime as the coastal cities of the Vilhon Reach, including Reth, profited from taxation on trade goods that passed the city's harbors. Convicted smugglers and tax evaders were fined, their goods were confiscated, and individuals were sometimes banished from Reth.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The council of merchants that governed Reth kept tariffs and taxes low, so the city attracted high numbers of trade ships. Even though the city was located far from major centers of production and industry, the city had access to iron mined in the Akanapeaks. Most of the food and drink in Reth came from the cities of Akanul .</p>
<p>Reth attracted tourism via its popular gladiatorial battles. Many of the gladiators were freeborn adventurers who were promised fame and riches, unlike many other gladiatorial arenas that existed on the backs of slaves. Reth's gladiators usually had life-long careers and successful fighters lived in luxury and gained minor noble status.</p>
<p>Apart from entertainment, Reth produced fish , quarried stone, and lumber. Reth's logging operations took place in Nunwood and brought ire of the Emerald Enclave in the past. By the late 14 th century DR, Reth was winding down its production of lumber under the Enclave's pressure.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>An alliance was forged between Reth, Hlath , and Nun . The cities agreed to offer each other protection from sea-side attacks. However, Reth failed to aid Hlath in its war with arcanaloth Yrkhetep of 1357 DR , causing tensions in the aftermath. Since being separated from Chondath, Reth built a strong navy, ready to withstand a possible attack by Arrabarr. Reth sent patrols to its south, keeping the lands between the city and the Fields of Nun safe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Reth was founded by Chondath in the Year of the Bright Plumage, 320 DR , along with Nleeth and Amah , as a location to training centers for the ritual combat of the Southsand Games . The combat competition of tactics and wit became a major tourist attraction for all of the three cities.</p>
<p>The Chondathan civil war was sparked in the Year of the Thirsty Sword, 900 DR , as the governors of Hlath and Reth took more control over their cities. This prompted King Neveris Bikou of Chondath to send his armies towards Hlath. Both towns, Hlath and Reth, joined forces and sent their armies into a bloody battle against Chondathan's troops along the Emerald Corridor to the south of River Nun . By the Year of the August Armathor, 901 DR , the war turned Hlath and Reth against each other, and Whinonas Ferentier , the leader of Hlath, used ancient Netherese sorcery against advancing armies of Hondath and Reth. In response, wizards of Arrabar and Reth retaliated with deadly Netherese magics themselves, scorching the battlegrounds with death and destruction. In the Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , troops from Reth clashed in combat with joined armies of Arrabar and Hlath in the Fields of Nun, in the foothills of the Akanapeaks. The rulers of Chondathan cities craved an easy win and ordered their wizards to summon deadly necromantic plagues. The resulting epidemic killed two-thirds of the Chondathan armies in minutes. The survivors took the plague home, spreading the deadly disease. The devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar's loss of influence. All the cities of Chondath, apart from Iljak declared independence, making Reth a self-governed city-state.</p>
<p>The Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR brought Reth sponsorship of Turmish as the country's new ruler, Lord Saros , established ports across the Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Horn, 1222 DR , Alion Narithryn , a noble "dragon slayer" from Westgate , traveled to Reth on orders from the clergy of Lathander . There, he secretly unleashed a blue dragon hatchling of a savage temper, his pet. Heroically, Alion set out to slay the mighty beast as the hatchling devoured farm life and peasants growing quickly. It was presumed that Alion Narithryn did slay the dragon. However, both the slayer and the blue wyrm disappeared, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Reth was under the control of Chessenta with a separatist movement active that sought to join with the city's old masters – Chondath. However, the rulers of Reth were opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>Circa the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Reth was struggling with separatist sentiments as a significant portion of the population sought to leave Chessenta and become part of Chondath. However, the ruling council did non wish to change Reth's status quo nor wanted to have close ties with Chondath. During the same period of time, Reth came under regular attacks from the orcs of Akanapeaks. The inhabitants of Reth called for retaliatory action against the mountain tribes. The council knew that that would lead to a war and eventual destruction of the city-state.</p>
<p>Circa the Highharvestide of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , Xvimlar clerics led by Ruinlord Glorganna , arrived in Reth to establish a temple of Iyachtu Xvim . By Uktar 18 of the same year, a large shrine of Gargauth was claimed by the Xvimlar cultists and was turned into the Temple of the Dark Eyes . Folk of Reth were unnerved with the presence of Zhents and their evil god, while the council of merchants was quite content with the new trade brought to the city by the Zhentarim . By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Xvimlar planned to have the Temple of the Dark Eyes usurp the rulership of Reth, becoming one of the most influential centers of Xvim worship.</p>
<p>Reth was reported half-destroyed during the Spellplague . Half of Reth was destroyed and swallowed by the Bay of Silvanus 's waters while the remnants of the city fought to survive. In the spring of Year of Silent Death, 1395 DR , a black monolith appeared not far from Reth's coast following a violent thunderstorm. The next morning, a band of kuo-toa harpooners riding strange flying morkoths attacked Reth. The assault was stopped by the High Lady Glorganna and a band of Banite warriors. The kuo-toas belonged to the newly resurgent Abolethic Sovereignty and one of their floating cities. However, it was a mystery what was the goal of the reckless attack on Reth.</p>
