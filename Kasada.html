<p>Kasada was the second emperor of Wa , according to the mythological pre-history of that nation.</p>
<h2>Legends</h2>
<p>According to legend, after a long period of strife known as the War of the Spirits , which began with the death of Wa's first emperor Kochi , Kasada retook the mythical Moonlight Arrow back from the Spirit of Yakamashi Mountain . With this sacred symbol, he ascended the throne as the second emperor and ushered in a new era. Afraid to name the new age after himself, Kasada ordained that the new time period would be called the era of Koyo .</p>
<p>The southern tribes of korobokuru supported Kasada's rule, but there was still conflict against the northern korobokru tibes.</p>
<p>The descendants of Kasada maintained the dynasty through at least two eras, including the era of Kuni . When the final Kasada emperor died without an heir, a new ruling family emerged, the Goshukaras , ushering in the beginning of the modern Wa calendar . This was the Year of Harbor's Lights, âˆ’417 DR .</p>
