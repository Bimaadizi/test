<p>The Warring States (or simply the warring states ) were a group of countries in the south of Kara-Tur known for their conflicts.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>They lay in the wooded lands south of T'u Lung and between Petan in the west and Malatra in the east.</p>
<h2>Relations</h2>
<p>The Warring States were often at war with T'u Lung, ever since that empire was established in Shou Year 2316 (1066 DR) . Around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , the Fengnao Province of T'u Lung had some political connections to the Warring States. By that time, Nu'sazto Ichi , the son of a captured general of the Warring States, had been brought to the imperial court in Wai , kept as an amusement despite his clumsy attempts to assassinate Emperor Wai Gada Sinzu . The emperor believed Nu'sazto to be a crude barbarian.</p>
