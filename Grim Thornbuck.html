<p>Grim Thornbuck was a member of the Knights of the Black Fist in Phlan in 1489 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He usually became indebted to the wrong people and did all he had to to repay the debts.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1489 DR, he was in charge of the Black Fist detachment at Sokol Keep . When the quartermaster, Igan Sokol , announced that he had discovered a treasure thanks to a strange ghost , Grim and his fellows were filled with greed. Thus, when they came to the right room of the dungeon, Grim killed Igan. This however angered both the ghost Harae and the undead guardian of the dungeon. Thus Grim and his fellows were trapped and besieged inside the room.</p>
<p>In the end, they may have been rescued by some adventurers hired to solve the mystery of the keep, but Grim and his fellows would very probably still need to face justice.</p>
