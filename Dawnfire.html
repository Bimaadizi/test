<p>Dawnfire was the ancient capital of the kingdom ruled by the gold dragon King Orchtrien by the end of the Time of Dragons .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The city was built as a single large castle. A wonder to the eye, the city seemed to be hewn from the top of its mountaintop resting place rather than being built there; the entire place was ornamented tastefully, and caught the eye in an especially fetching way at dawnbreak.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>There was a single road from the base of the mountain all the way up to the castle. The nation contested lands east of a river with a force of green dragons, presumably the green cabal , almost certainly on its west. To the southeast were other lands that Orchtrien contested with other dragons.</p>
<p>Orchtrien's palace had at least one archway of precious metals, inlaid with gems, and marble stairs.</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>There was an Elf Quarter in Dawnfire, a grove of oak and shadowtop trees transplanted from old forests. Many of those shadowtop trees held canopy houses, with open platforms. One of them had a spiral staircase along its trunk.</p>
<p>Orchtrien's personal palace was a hive-like structure with a great door, that had a smaller door on the right doorblade for human-sized guests. The southern towers had a surrounding garden, that smelled of brunfelsia . Another tower, where he watched over things, was surrounded by greenery, which included pine trees, mutated by magical experiments so that their needles clinked with a metallic sound in the wind, and some of the flowers were pale, fleshy, with lidless eyes in their centers. The tower had illusory ceilings in the center of its one-room floors, to allow for a wyrm's ease of movement.</p>
<h3>Defenses</h3>
<p>There were a number of half-dragon soldiers in the city, comprising Orchtrien's personal guard. Much of Orchtrien's force was quartered in a nearby fortress.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>King Orchtrien had deputies, two of which were Maldur Breakstone and Rhespen Ash .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −25,000 DR , Orchtrien destroyed large portions of the city, including the royal keep and fortress, during the first Rage of Dragons .</p>
