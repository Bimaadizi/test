<p>A safety net was a rope enchanted with Darsson Spellmaker 's safe fall spell .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These ropes were made from giant spider or ettercap silk and were available in lengths of 50 feet (15 meters), 100 feet (30 meters), and 200 feet (61 meters).</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Once tied into a loop, a safety net created a feather fall effect that operated both vertically, horizontally, and at any angle. The safety net would eliminate the perpendicular inertia of whatever approached it. Thus, a safety net placed horizontally would impart a feather fall for someone falling down on top of it.</p>
<p>The limit on the amount of weight that could be affected was 200 pounds (91 kilograms) plus a number of pounds equal to twice the rope's length in feet. Multiple nets could be used to increase the area affected, but the weight limit was determined by the smaller net.</p>
