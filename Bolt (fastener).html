<p>Bolts and nuts were metal fasteners that were used in metalworking, carpentry, and construction. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included nails , spikes , and pegs .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bolts were typically less than 8‑inch (20‑centimeter) long and 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) or less in diameter. Their most important feature was their thread , which allowed a nut to attach and hold the materials in place.</p>
<p>A similar, simpler fastener was the link bolt , a clevis pin that had no thread and instead used an eyehole and pin to hold the rod in place, often tightened with the insertion of shims .</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of bolts, nuts, and related tools in various configurations and sizes. Bolts were available from 8‑inch (20‑centimeter) long and able to be cut to length, in ¼", ½", ¾", and 1‑inch (2.5‑centimeter) diameters for 3 gp /lb, and with fine and coarse threads. Variously-fitted nuts were available for 2 gp/lb.</p>
<p>For the most part, around the 1370s DR finely-made threaded screws and bolts were treated as "holy secrets of Gond " and used in temples, furniture, and devices built and owned by that faith. Link bolts were far more common, with human , dwarf , and gnome smiths producing them widely across the Sword Coast and Shining Sea of western Faerûn .</p>
