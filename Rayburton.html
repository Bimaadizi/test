<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The crest of the Rayburton family was a black "hawkdragon". It had the feathered head and beak of a hawk but the rest of the body, including scales, a forked tongue, large claws, and a reptilian tail, was very reminiscent of a dragon . The renowned explorer and historian Volothamp Geddarm posited that this symbol was the result of an inebriated Rayburton laying eyes on a wyvern .</p>
