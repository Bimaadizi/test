<p>A holy hand of Bane was a magic item found only within dark temples devoted to Bane , the Lord of Darkness. Only a handful of these wicked guardians were known to exist.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These obsidian sentinels stood 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. They levitated motionless in the air until activated.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A holy hand of Bane would activate automatically when a pure-hearted invididual entered the room where it waited. The hand would turn slowly to face the nearest target and would instantly attack anyone approaching within 60 feet (18 meters) of Bane's dark altar. The holy hand could sense all pure-hearted individuals within the temple and would pursue them constantly once activated.</p>
<p>A holy hand was completely immune to harm from all forms of fire and electricity, nor could they be controlled mentally or via magic . The hand would attempt to strike, grasp, or crush a single target at a time.</p>
<p>Any magic or enchanted items or weapons coming into contact with a holy hand were utterly absorbed. Additionally, any spells that would have caused a great deal of harm to the hand at a single time would actually heal the hand. Upon the hand's destruction, all magic absorbed by the hand was dissipated harmlessly, rather than released violently. A magic item drained by a holy hand could only be recharged via a wish . Any artifact coming into contact with a holy hand would be transported randomly to another plane of existence . The use of a dispel magic spell upon a hand would only slow it for one minute.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Holy hands of bane existed as far back as the 8 th century DR , when a Banite organization called the Brotherhood of the Black Hand established a secret safehouse in the city of Ascalhorn that featured one.</p>
