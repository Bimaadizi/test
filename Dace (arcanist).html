<p>The archwizards of Netheril saw Dace as not much more than an arcanist who should have been a priest . As many arcanists at the time considered themselves to be just below the gods, they frowned upon Dace's reverence.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dace was born in 1962 NY (−1897 DR) . In 1995 NY (−1864 DR) , Dace came up with the spell that would become known as comprehend languages . After developing ventriloquism and tongues , the arcanist invented the taunt spell. Dace attempted to discover a means of magical life extension and sought out potions to do so. However, archwizards of Netheril would plot to end Dace's life as they didn't share his utmost devotion to Mystryl. After Dace finally discovered a potion of longevity , these rival arcanists ordered the potion to be cursed . After becoming far older by imbibing the cursed potion, he finally died in 2083 NY (−1776 DR) .</p>
