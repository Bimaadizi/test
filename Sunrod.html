<p>Sunrods were a light source created either through alchemy or magic .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sunrods were iron rods with golden tips, measuring roughly 1 foot (0.3 meters) in length and weighing 1 pound (0.45 kilograms). They were activated by striking them against another surface.</p>
<p>They casted a steadier light than torch light, shining brighter and out to a wider radius. They also lasted for a longer duration —typically four to six hours —and they were difficult to extinguish. Once a sunrod's duration was over, its golden tip became dim and unusable.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Ember moss was one of the few known items that could be used in the creation of sunrods.</p>
