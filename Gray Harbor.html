<p>The Gray Harbor of Baldur's Gate was one of the largest and busiest ports located on the western coast of Faer√ªn . It spanned all six districts of the Gate's Lower City , forming a crescent along bottom of the city's distinct sloping bluffs.</p>
<p>Although this was the name of the harbor, it was previously bestowed upon the entirety of the settlement itself, before it was changed to "Baldur's Gate".</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Along the city, its harbor was inset within a natural bay that formed along the northern shore of the River Chionthar , about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) upstream from the Sea of Swords .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Massive in size and scope, the harbor featured over a dozen piers and an astounding seventy-six mechanical cranes that were used to load and unload cargoes onto and from ships. Operated by the guild-sponsored deckhands, these enormous devices were originally designed by the Baldurian clergy of Gond from the High House of Wonders .</p>
<p>Extending out from the Seatower of Balduran , there was a massive chain that, under normal circumstances, rested along the riverbed, before being tethered to a post in the eastern-most dock of Brampton . When necessary, a rotating capstan could be manned and the chain would raise taut, allowing no ships larger than a dinghy to pass into the port.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Gray Harbor was bustling with activity at all hours, day and night, but especially busy in the hours before dawn.</p>
<p>Due to the city's receptive nature and business-first mentality, a great variety of cargo passed through the docks of Gray Harbor. Even pirates and smugglers could find a home for their ship, even if only for a short while.</p>
