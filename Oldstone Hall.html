<p>Oldstone Hall was a manor house located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr and home of the town's lords.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The manor house lay in the center of town, on Wheloon Way, opposite the Wheloon Moothouse .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Oldstone Hall was the grandest building in Wheloon. Its façade was an impressive edifice of soot-darkened stone, intricately decorated with carved monsters: gargoyles , gremlins , jubbrawuks , satyrs , and wyverns . It was built in the style of early Cormyrean manor houses, of palatial size and almost a castle , suggesting old pride, old wealth, and old entitlement.</p>
<p>It was surrounded by large paddock of lush, well-groomed grass, dotted with many big and old duskwood , oak , and shadowtop trees. This was, in turn, enclosed by high stone walls and a set of gates. Stone monsters on plinths also flanked the gates and rested on the walls.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The gates were warded against unauthorized visitors by ring ward s that triggered a warning alarm if contacted.</p>
<p>Of the stone monsters guarding the walls and manor, the gargoyles were said to animate if commanded by the lord of Wheloon or the Court Wizard of Cormyr.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Oldstone Hall was the home of the lords of Wheloon. In the mid-to-late 14th century DR, this was Lord Sarp Redbeard . Other privileged guests could stay there, such as the king's messengers, War Wizards , and some Harpers . Few others were allowed beyond the gates.</p>
