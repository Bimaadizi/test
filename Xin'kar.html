<p>Xin'kar was fragment of the ancient Netherese enclave of Xinlenal that broke off during Karsus's Folly , and became an independent community for a time before falling into ruin.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was situated deep within the Neverwinter Wood , within the territory claimed by the Gray Wolf tribe of Uthgardt barbarians .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The arcanists of Xin'kar forged a wraith eidolon to protect their research facility from the dangers of the Neverwinter Wood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following the calamity of Karsus's Folly in the Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR , the flying cities of Netheril came crashing to the ground. During Xinlenal's descent, a circle of arcanists used their magic to protect part of the city and bring it safely down to an area of the Neverwinter Wood. The survivors renamed their new sanctum Xin'kar, and renewed their arcane scholarship. They focused their studies on the profound primal magic that emanated from the woods.</p>
<p>After some time, the scholars Xin'kar reopened communication with survivors from Xinlenal and went to their aid. Those left in Xin'kar were overrun by Uthgardt barbarians, who founded the settlement of Vellosk in the lands surrounding the enclave.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Red Wizards of Thay delved into the ruins of Xin'kar in search of some unknown relics. Their efforts were thwarted by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge , who fought in service of Kyrn Whitesky of the Forsworn .</p>
