<p>Lassos , also known as lariats , were a relatively nonlethal form of exotic ranged weaponry.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lassos were little more than lengths of rope , typically thin, knotted with a slipknot at the end to create a large loop.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Lassos were used by simply twirling them in the air, then hurling them at a target and pulling the rope taut once the loop landed around their target.</p>
<p>Within this simple framework there was a variety tricks that could be done with lassos. They could be settled around a target's legs to trip them, settled around their necks to strangle, or settled about their torso and arms to pin them down. Though in the latter case, there was a chance a target might shrug the rope off before a wielder could pull their lasso taut.
People were also known to settle lassos about a mounted target's torso, bracing for impact as they pulled them to the ground off their mount.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the 14 th century DR , Tsenya Garbo captured Sandiraksiva using a golden lasso.</p>
<p>Some time prior to 1367 DR , a nephew of Lyra Sunrose was trampled to death by a herd of wild horses when he attempted to lasso a mare in the oat fields along the western shore of Lake Sember .</p>
