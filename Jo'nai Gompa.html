<p>Jo'nai Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language ) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was found in the south of Tabot.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Pang of Pokarr Gompa dismissed Jo'nai, Mafensea , and Lo'S'sem Gompas as "all alike", with "primitive and gaudy" ceremonies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was founded some time between Shou Year 585 (−665 DR) and Shou Year 640 (−610 DR) , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Jo'nai.</p>
<p>Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Jo'nai was among those southern monasteries opposing the northern monasteries in the yig-tsang (monk council) of Tabot. Meanwhile, spies loyal to Lady Holang of Pim Tung had infiltrated the monastery at all levels.</p>
