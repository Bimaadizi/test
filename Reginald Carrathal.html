<p>Reginald Carrathal was High King of Callidyrr in the Moonshae Isles during the early-to-mid 14 th century DR . Like his predecessors, although he held the title of High King of the Moonshae Isles, he was considered to be merely a figurehead by the Ffolk outside of Callidyrr.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was the final ruler of the Carrathal Dynasty . He was the third son of his father and predecessor, King Alec IV .</p>
<p>Reginald had a bastard son with an Amnian woman. The son's name was Brynth , and became Reginald's heir.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He assumed the throne of Callidyrr in the Year of the Sword and Stars, 1332 DR , after the death of his father. His reign lasted fifteen years.</p>
<p>Beginning in the Year of the Bloodbird, 1346 DR , King Reginald became more and more withdrawn. This was the result of a series of carefully placed charms placed upon the King by his advisor Cyndre , making the King dependant upon Cyndre for everything. The king soon became little more than a puppet in service of Bhaal , and so was deposed by Tristan Kendrick .</p>
