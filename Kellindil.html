<p>Kellindil was an elf archer and a member of Dove Falconhand 's traveling party in the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When he encountered Drizzt Do'Urden , he challenged him, ignoring his pleas to parley and attacked him, however, Drizzt managed to escape. Believing in the end that the drow was an exception to his race's reputation, he promised Dove to keep track of him and watch his actions. He then left a healing potion and a dagger behind for Drizzt to use.</p>
<p>Kellindil kept his promise and followed Drizzt to Mooshie's Grove , where he saw the battle that ensued between the rangers and the forces assembled by Roddy Mc Gristle . In the aftermath of the battle, he pursued Roddy and tied him up to have him tried for his crimes in Sundabar , mainly against Montolio Debrouchee and Drizzt Do'Urden, as he was the one who led an army of orcs and winter wolves against them in Mooshie's Grove. However, Tephanis cut Roddy's bindings and Roddy strangled the elf with his bare hands. Then he buried him and whatever supplies he couldn't carry.</p>
