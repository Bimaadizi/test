<p>Andreth Thalendur was a War Wizard who served the Royal Court of Cormyr in Suzail under the direct command of the Royal Magician Vangerdahast Aeiulvana in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , Andreth Thalendur was placed in charge of enchanting speaking-stones that were in wide use among Coryrean nobles, court, and the War Wizards. Andreth found himself abusing access to the speaking-stones of his creation. However, he always claimed to have been trained to hear the words of the nobles but not listen to them. In 1348 DR, following the Battle of Hunter's Hollow , Andreth Thalendur was confronted by the Crownsilver nobles â€“ Maniol Crownsilver and his wife Jalassa , who demanded an audience with the King Azoun Obarskyr IV . Maniol attempted to manhandle Andreth, but the smug wizard calmly and politely allowed the nobleman to grab his enchanted robes. Diminutive blue-white arcs of electricity zapped the Crownsilver treasonous fingers away. Andreth informed the nobleman that the War Wizards were testing these enchanted robes on behalf of Vangerdahast. Andreth informed the Royal Magician of the angry Crownsilver, who held the audience instead of the King, as Andreth returned to listening in through Crownsilvers' speaking-stone .</p>
