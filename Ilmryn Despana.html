<p>Ilmryn Despana was once the weapon master of House Despana .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Ilmyrn owned a special House Despana insignia, crafted by his brother, Malavon . It was a small obsidian and adamantite amulet, with a purple ribbon attached to it. Ilmyrn was gifted the trinket by Malavon. This insignia was enchanted , and the wearer could cast three spells a day when it was worn: Melf's acid arrow , Otiluke's resilient sphere , and blur .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ilmyrn was often found in the Ust Natha tavern , where he would tell of his adventures to fellow drow. He completed the Blooding in 1368 DR, where he made a long voyage to the surface with two brothers. He found the surface horrid, and met a beautiful young elf, whom he slaughtered "too easily". He and his brothers (who were slaughtered) were hunted by surface elf patrols, but Ilmyrn made it back to the Underdark, with the female's head in his hand. It was a fine trophy, and his matron mother , as a result, sponsored him entry into Ust Natha 's male fighter's guild.</p>
<p>When the Lolth -worshiping matriarchy was assaulted by his brother, Malavon , and his brother's allies in the worship of Vhaeraun , Ilmyrn had to face his brother in battle. At first, the weapon master had the upper hand, but Malavon invoked the power of Ilmryn's amulet by means of a secret word. The enchanted insignia Ilmyrn wore responded and cast a magical protective sphere around its wearer.</p>
<p>However, when Ilmyrn emerged from the resilient sphere , he was faced against several powerful tanar'ri . Here, he was slain, cursing the name Malavon.</p>
