<p>Darkenshield was a small Cormyrean village in the Stonelands which was destroyed by the forces of the Lost King Gondegal in 1352 DR . The symbol of the village was a black shield with a white star in the upper left corner, set on a blue field.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Darkenshield was located on the edge of the Stonelands about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Halfhap and the Moonsea Ride , and about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the Storm Horns and Wyvernwatch Castle along the Stonebolt Trail . The land around it consisted of dry, desolate plains punctuated by hillocks and copses of trees.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>During Gondegal 's war against Cormyr in 1352 DR , the Starburst Swords unit of Purple Dragons marched through the Stonelands and chose to avoid an easily winnable battle with the Twilight Brigade , a unit of Gondegal 's forces. The Twilight Brigade went on to attack Darkenshield and easily overwhelmed its militia, razing it to the ground and slaughtering the entire population. The spirits of Darkenshield's residents were bound to the ruins by the outrage of their deaths, unable to pass on while their killers lived. The Starburst Swords went on to be attacked by a gang of trolls below the Tower of Ruin , with not a one surviving, and their spirits were also trapped by the shame of their dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Lord Vorik Aris built up a fortified base nearby at Wyvernwatch Castle and made preparations for making war on Cormyr like Gondegal had. Among his soldiers he recruited the surviving 32 Twilight Brigade members, and made one of them, Tobias Querl , the Captain of the guard of Wyvernwatch. At the same time, the bard Mendryll Belarod caught wind of exciting rumors of ghosts and crumbled towers, and sent a group of adventurers to investigate the old battle sites with the assistance of an old rhyme he had come across. They explored the area and uncovered the history of what had really happened, also discovering the plans Lord Aris had for occupying Darkenshield and using it as a base of operations of aggressive raids throughout the region.</p>
<p>After realising the severity of the situation, Mendryll met up again with the adventurers at Darkenshield with Rhyn Mournsoul in tow. Together they performed the ritual of vengeance Olin Foolsgold had left behind, as well as a second ritual contained in the old rhyme that used the Four from Cormyr and allowed the Starburst Swords another chance to perform their duty of defending the village. When the second battle of Darkenshield began, the Twilight Brigade was specially targeted by the ghosts of Darkenshield and destroyed completely, while Lord Aris and his lieutenants Gribbergrash , Tanatha , and Ratakos were either killed or driven away in retreat.</p>
<p>The battle ended with Lord Aris' army destroyed, and his ambitions of conquering Cormyr severely set back. With the great injustice righted, the folk of Darkenshield were finally laid to rest and passed to the City of Judgment , while the spirits of the Starburst Swords finally fulfilled their duties and passed to Torm 's domain.</p>
