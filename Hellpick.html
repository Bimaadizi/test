<p>Hellpick was a sturdy dwarvish magic warhammer that once belonged to a hero named Durlow Ironbar , some years before 1281 DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The weapon possessed a potent +3 enchantment .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Like many dwarven weapons, the Hellpick was blessed by the dwarven deity Moradin upon its creation. Its first known wielder was warrior Durlow Ironbar, who smashed countless skulls with this weapon across numerous battlefields. The name itself – "Hellpick" was earned when Durlow wielded the warhammer against drow mages , and their evil spawn pulled from the depths of the Abyss . Even though it was never confirmed, dwarven legends claimed that the Hellpick killed a yochlol , the evil "Handmaiden of Lolth."</p>
<p>Years later, Durlow Ironbar was killed by a magically disguised drow who poisoned the hero. Despite being on the brink of death, Durlow used the Hellpick to kill four out of five assassins before perishing.</p>
<p>Over time this weapon changed hands, until ending up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR .</p>
