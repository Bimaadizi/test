He was rumored to have been working on a special chain of magic that would allow him to hurls dozens of spells at once with minimal effort. It was during this period of research when he was challenged by Tsanbrin Aulmeroevler after Weldrarn destroyed the school of wizardry where Tsanbrin was studying, who was Weldrarn's third challenge to his title.
