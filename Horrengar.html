Just as they managed to enter the main gates of Thrymstone, their efforts came under attack by both the white dragons of Kovanyrach and adventurers from Waterdeep . As the adventurers invaded the fortress, Horrengar expressed disappointment that such successful enemies were so small. In the ensuing fight, Horrengar remained defiant as the adventurers broke his axe and forced him to surrender.</p>
