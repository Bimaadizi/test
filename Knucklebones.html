<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Ancient</h3>
<p>Though knucklebones was known around Faer√ªn and beyond, it was particularly famous for one specific tale. This tale involved the god Jergal and three incredibly ambitious men: Bane , Bhaal , and Myrkul . The three mortals wished to assume Jergal's throne, and as he had grown tired of his rule, he accepted. However, they could not determine who among them would rule. Thus, Jergal proposed a game of skull bowling, where each of them would take the skulls of Jergal's most powerful liches, and roll them across the Gray Waste . When Malar interrupted their game of skull bowling, Jergal instead proposed to play knucklebones. The three accepted. Whoever won would choose one out of three of Jergal's portfolios. Whoever came second would choose next, and whoever was last would take the remaining one.</p>
<p>The game began as Jergal broke off his bones and handed them to the three mortals. When the game ended, the winner was declared to be Bane, followed by Myrkul, and in last place was Bhaal. Bane chose the portfolio of tyranny, whilst Myrkul chose the dead, and Bhaal chose murder. When Malar returned, he found that the game of knucklebones was already over, and alas, only the beasts were left for him.</p>
<h3>14 th century DR</h3>
<p>When Kelemvor claimed the position of Lord Death from Cyric , he recalled the ancient tale of how Myrkul had once won the position via a game of knucklebones. It made him realize that if he did not carry out his duties as a deity , he could be very easily replaced.</p>
