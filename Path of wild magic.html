<p>The path of wild magic was a primal path that some barbarians followed, that saw them receive influence from powerful magic that often originated from other planes of existence .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As most barbarians lived deep in the wilds of nature, they became more susceptible to the influence of wild magic . Over the years, living in remote locales that were influenced by energies from the Feywild , or even the Upper planes , they accumulated supernatural powers that were often practiced by their ancient forebears.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Aasimar , genasi , tiefling , and other planetouched individuals were most among those barbarians that followed the path of wild magic.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>By their very nature, wild magic barbarians garnered greater awareness of magic and dweomers that remained nearby. One or more times per day, they could detect the location of any magical spell within 60 ft (18 m) of their person, and even determine the school of magic from which it originated.</p>
<p>As they honed their abilities, barbarians that walked the path could tap into wild magic whenever they entered into their rage . Surprising and sometimes catastrophous events could occur as a result of their wild magic surges. They could just as easily conjure the spirit of a flumph as they could imbue their weapon with magical force energy . Skilled barbarians could even harness this power to bolster the combat prowess of themselves or their allies.</p>
<p>Some of the most well-traveled and venerated barbarians became so in-tune with wild magic, that the inherent magical energy within them would lash out if they ever became truly in danger.</p>
<p>Yet it was only the most-experienced wild magic barbarians who could truly control and harness their wild magic surges. Whenever they raged or faced true peril, they could deliberately conjure protective lights around their body, teleport themselves away, shoot out bolts of lightning , or manifest other wild magic feats.</p>
