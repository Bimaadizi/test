<p>Ryxfith was the leader of a group of ettercaps who occupied the upper floors and spires of Castle Never as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The ettercap thought of itself as a mystic or prophet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The ettercaps of Castle Never had once dwelt deep in the dungeons while the building was still in use, but following its abandonment after the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the midâ€“15 th century DR, they claimed the ruined castle as its new rulers. However, when the undead servants of Valindra Shadowmantle arrived, it forced Ryxfith's ettercaps to flee to the upper floors, where they proceeded to fill the halls and spires with their webs.</p>
<p>As long as they stayed away, the Thayan undead left the ettercaps alone, and so they soon grew complacent. Then, a beholder known as Talgath arrived in Castle Never, and began attempting to subjugate the ettercaps. As of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Ryxfith was declaring a prophecy that strangers from outside the castle would soon arrive to liberate them from the menace posed by Talgath.</p>
