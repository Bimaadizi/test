<h2>History</h2>
<p>Deirdre Gallaway was a young and ambitious member of the Gallaway Coaster, daughter to Rawleigh Gallaway , and granddaughter of Ilmus Gallaway of Easthaven . Shortly before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Deirdre was sent to run the Gallaway Trade Depot in Targos with aid and council from Jemeliah , her father's loyal friend and employee. Deirdre's ambitions, however, were cut short by the grim reality of war. That year, the Legion of the Chimera targeted the Ten Towns and besieged Targos, costing the coaster profit and forcing Deidre to provide the town with weapons and lumber on credit with some persuasion by the Speaker Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmore . The loss of income embittered young woman, causing tensions between the coaster and the leadership of Targos.</p>
