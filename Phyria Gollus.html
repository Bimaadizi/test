<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the Cult of the Absolute . The crisis flooded the city with refugees, elevating tensions among its citizens and allowing a new power to take rulership of the city â€“ Lord Gortash . Phyria eagerly consumed the new lord's propaganda from the curbside preachers and from the pages of the Baldur's Mouth Gazette. Augur Harxkellan was a Gortash loyalist whose words attracted a crowd of gawkers in the Lower City with Phyria Gollus among them. As a fellow loyalist, Phyria approved of Gortash and his steel watchers .</p>
