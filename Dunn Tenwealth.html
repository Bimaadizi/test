<p>Dunn Tenwealth was a priest of Torm in the mid–14 th century DR . He served as high priest at the Temple of Torm's Coming in Tantras before and during the Time of Troubles and was a member of the city's High Council .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Right after the start of the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR , Dunn discovered one of the Tablets of Fate in the basement of his temple. Meanwhile, the god Torm incarnated in an avatar in Tantras and told his devotees that his arrival was caused by the theft of the Tablets.</p>
<p>Dunn did not tell Torm that he had one of the Tablets but instead, together with the other senior members of the church, decided that the arrival of their god was a sign that Tantras was Torm's chosen city and that they needed to convert or eliminate the other churches. So they secretly paid assassins to destroy all the other's gods temples and later kill all the faithful of other gods who did not escape the city. Dunn's secret project was larger: he dreamed of uniting all of Tantras's citizens under Torm and with the Tablet march to reclaim Torm's rightful divine plane .</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Dunn, the god Torm started to suspect something and later the heroes Adon , Midnight , and Kelemvor Lyonsbane , arrived in the city to warn about a Zhent invasion led by the god Bane . They investigated the destruction of the other temples and searched for the Tablet, which they knew Bane had hidden in the city, and this was the reason for the impeding invasion.</p>
<p>In the end, Bane empowered himself by consuming all the assassins in the Realms, so Dunn and his conspirators recruited some common people to kill a recently discovered cell of worshipers of Oghma . However, the god Torm and the heroes, having discovered the entire plot, easily subdued the inexpert killers and soon confronted Dunn. Dunn and the other senior members of the church explained that all they'd done was in the name of Torm and they did not have bad intentions, but the god was disgusted and ordered them to put them in prison.</p>
<p>Soon after, however, Bane and the Zhent troops arrived. To gain enough power to face Bane, Torm decided to absorb the souls of many of his worshipers. At first, he did not want the souls of Dunn and his associates, but at last Torm understood that they were misguided and only needed pardoning. He absorbed the souls of Dunn and the senior members of the church and added them to his power. With all the souls' power, Torm and Bane killed each other.</p>
