<p>Ignace Dethingeller was a loremaster of Baldur's Gate who journeyed to Anchorome in the 1370s DR .</p>
<p>He communicated with Tethtoril , the First Reader of Candlekeep . In one letter, he reported he had journeyed north of Fort Flame to an unnamed island where the wreckage of a flying ship was discovered. From a journal that Dethingeller was able to recover, he learned that the ship had been captained by Eartharran Neirdre from Evermeet and that it had crashed after battle with a wing of dragons . The journal contained sketches Eartharran Neirdre had made of statues from a floating city that had been abandoned. These statues depicted a race that had both draconic and avian features which Neirdre speculated either belonged to a draconic race that had evolved these features or possibly a race that was a common ancestor to both the dragons and aearee . The city was said to have been protected by a wing of dragons.</p>
