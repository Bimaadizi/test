<p>An ardent was an unconventional philosopher of psionics , whose strong commitment to and pursuit of particular cosmic philosophies allowed them to tap into their obscure reserve of great power, a psionic mantle , obtaining a suite of thematic powers. They were akin to a cleric among the various types of psionic wielders, a comparison that was not without some faults, as their powers were not reliant upon reverence of a deity .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Across the Realms, ardents were comparatively far fewer in number than the more common psionic pathways of the psion , psychic warrior , soulknife , and wilder . Many ardents could be found living in organized religious structures, such as a monastery of Deneir or temple of Deep Duerra , but could just as often be found on their own.</p>
<p>They were passionate individuals, showing just as much enthusiasm towards these philosophies as any divine missionary. They sought signs of, and support for, their cosmic philosophy everywhere they went. Ardents often viewed their involvement in just about any enterprise as an opportunity to spread awareness of their philosophy, and to enlighten those who relied upon less "universally true" sources for their daily guidance and inspiration. They naturally gravitated towards groups that would support bringing their brand of enlightenment to others and might see members of an adventuring company as potential first converts. The most dark and corrupt of ardents would go so far as to force others to follow their path.</p>
<p>Ardents were typically very intelligent people, with sufficient bodily stamina to keep up with a life of traveling for their studies. Becoming an ardent required having a philosophical mind and a good deal of education in esoteric concepts and ideas. They were equally as likely to come from any of the psionically-inclined sentient races, but humans seemed most apt to follow such a path. Savage and monstrous humanoids generally lacked the aforementioned pre-requisites.</p>
<h3>Religions</h3>
<p>One could find an ardent drawing power from any one of the deities of the Faer√ªnian pantheon , as well as Corellon Larethian , Garl Glittergold , Gruumsh , Moradin , Yondalla , and even Vecna . However, they were most frequently found among religions with a specific connection to psionics, such as Deep Duerra, Deneir, Ilsensine , Laduguer , Pisaethces , and Sseth . During the time of Jhaamdath , ardents within the empire typically worshiped Auppenser , and some could still be found worshiping the god in the late 14 th century DR . Some ardents who dedicated themselves to the concept of storms, drawing power from either Talos or Umberlee , took their devotion to greater heights by becoming what were known as storm disciples .</p>
<p>Compared to clerics and other divine spellcasters , ardents were more detached from the religion they followed. Their worship was more casual, less focused on reverence towards a deity's sanctity, but more to the concepts and philosophies that a deity represented. They might view these to be the only constants throughout the multiverse or as concepts that transcended the multiverse itself. This resulted in them often being beneath a god's notice.</p>
<p>An ardent's choice in the cosmic philosophies they followed was of a personal nature. They gravitated towards those that were suitable to their own life experiences, their upbringing, their heritage, and emotional leanings. The choice could also derive from an ardent's alignment and the portfolio of the deity they worshiped. The personal nature of this choice resulted in ardents developing unique understandings of their chosen philosophies, as well as unique approaches to the pursuit of greater psionic power.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Ardents, like divine minds , drew their psionic powers and a unique psionic ability from the knowledge of psionic mantles, distillations of universal concepts and philosophies. But whereas the latter started their journey with only one mantle, ardents always started theirs with two, knowing one power from each mantle. These were their "primary" mantles, the ones that most appealed to them and that an ardent believed held the most potential power.</p>
<p>Over the course of their career an ardent could learn four additional mantles. These other mantles were "secondary", philosophies worthy of study but less central to the universe from the ardent's perspective. An ardent always had to maintain a balance between the two, having more powers from their primary mantles than from their secondary. At two points within their long pursuit of power and philosophy, as their worldviews changed and they began to value other concepts more highly, an ardent was capable of swapping the priority of two mantles.</p>
<p>While divine mind could only choose among their favored deity's mantles and never from their opposing alignment, an ardent had no qualms with choosing mantles that were diametrically opposed, such as the chaos mantle and law mantle , or even aligned mantles that they did not share the alignment of. This was usually done by those of a neutral alignment, however, as manifesting powers from aligned mantles was considered to be an act of that alignment.</p>
<p>The reasons for why an ardent might choose contradictory mantles varied. Some might desire to embody a series of contradictions, some might wish to constantly seek ways of balancing such contradictory philosophies. Others may do so in pursuit of better understanding an alignment they have taken to fighting against. And some may do so simply as part of their scholarly pursuit to better understand universal truths.</p>
<p>Over time, as they grew increasingly aware of the interconnected nature of cosmic philosophies and their understanding of how the multiverse functioned expanded, an ardent gained access to further powers from their mantles. These powers, much like those of other methodologies for wielding psionics, were ingrained in the ardent's head and thus required no preparation like the spells of a spellcaster. However, they did need to rest each day to regain their mental strength.</p>
<p>In terms of combat, they were equally capable of wearing any form of armor and shield , though they wielded simple weapons and would never use a tower shield . Their ardent's approach to battles varied depending upon what mantles they followed, though it was usually a single approach. Those who followed the mantles of Conflict and Guardian would relish wading into the thick of a battlefield, while one who followed the mantle of Energy or Mind might prefer to assist from the back lines. Unlike other psionic users, an ardent could supplement their powers with their mantle abilities, allowing them to conserve psionic energy when necessary.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Some strongly religious communities could take umbrage with ardents, viewing them as encouraging people away from the traditional institutions of religion.</p>
<p>Ardents had a special fondness for other intellectuals, such as psions and wizards . Towards divinely focused folk like clerics, paladins , and druids an ardent might express pity, disdain, or possibly even unease around them. For most other forms of adventurer, ardents largely felt ambivalence.</p>
