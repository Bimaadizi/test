<p>Suelasta was a collector of exotic animals who lived in Tajar in the Pearl Cities region of west Zakhara in 1367Â DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Suelasta's menagerie was located near Al-Adib River within the city. Though he strove hard to collect an impressive variety of animals and monsters from all over Al-Toril , his safety practices were somewhat lacking, resulting in the occasional breakout of a savage creature within Tajar.</p>
