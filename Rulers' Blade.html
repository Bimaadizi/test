<p>The Ruler's Blade , also known as the Great King's Sword or ar'cor'kerym in Elven , and sometimes referred to as the Crownblade , ) was one of three elfblades created in ancient Cormanthyr to help the elves establish a ruling family. This particular blade was used to name the Coronal , the monarchical ruler of the kingdom of Cormanthyr and leader of the elves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Ruler's Blade was created by Elven High Magic alongside its mates, the Warblade and the Artblade in −4000 DR , at the behest of the ill Coronal of Jhyrennstar , Oacenth , who desired the magical swords to determine the rulers of the united tribes and new nation of Cormanthyr. Since it was drawn by the first Coronal Kahvoerm Irithyl , it never left the side of the Coronals.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Bloody Tusk, 661 DR , after the passing of Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl , the Ruler's Blade hovered atop the Rule Tower awaiting a claiming ceremony during the five years of mourning instituted by the Coronal's niece and lone heir, Aravae Irithyl . Aravae was ultimately murdered three years after her uncle died, and in the Year of Stern Judgment, 666 DR , the first open Claiming Ceremony begun in Myth Drannor . Every noble house sent representatives who each in turn were destroyed after being proven unworthy. Days passed as more and more elves tested their might, but none proved worthy. Soon, some non-elves attempted to draw the blade, which caused civil strife and combat before the Rule Tower. In the end, the Srinshee drew the blade and was proven worthy. However, saddened at the moral failings of the elves, she took the blade and her High Mages and departed from the mortal realm to Arvandor until a time when she deemed the elves worthy of the gift of the Ruler's Blade and a Coronal who couldunite the elves as Oacenth wished returned to claim it.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR , the Srinshee returned at last to Myth Drannor and offered the Ruler's Blade to Ilsevele Miritar in recognition of her wise rulership and involvement in the realm's refounding. Ilsevele accepted the blade and became the first Coronal in over seven centuries.</p>
<h2>Blade-Rite</h2>
<p>To become Coronal of the elves, an heir must pass the test of Blade-rite , an ancient ritual which culminated in the drawing of the Ruler's Blade . Only one such elf failed to draw the blade; this was Divisav Irithyl , a greedy son of the first Coronal, Kahvoerm Irithyl.</p>
<p>A successful candidate to wield the Ruler's Blade should be lawful good and have the interests of Cormanthyr at heart. They should be socially adept and able to handle delicate negotiations with diplomacy.</p>
<p>Failure of even one of the three tests, as part of Blade-rite, saw the wielder consumed in arcane fire within a minute, killing them instantly and leaving no trace.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The blade appeared as if it was carved from stone from afar, though in reality it was simply raw iron that was pitted and craggy. An elven crown rune was stamped just above the quillons. Golden light crackled like lightning up and down the blade, casting its light. Two black selu'kiira were bound at each end of the quillons, while a red one was on the pommel.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The Ruler's Blade , like others of its type, shared some common characteristics with its kin elfblades , but also had its own special powers.</p>
<p>With a command word , the wielder of the blade was able to heal other as with the heal spell three times per day and sense deceptions as with detect lie or discern lies at will.</p>
<p>The blade's owner was also granted the knowledge of three high mages whose essences were imbued in the gems within. The knowledge of the three high mages manifested as greatly improved knowledge of the Art and spell -craft, and a general improvement in all other branches of knowledge.</p>
