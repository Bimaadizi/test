<p>Mossy deathcap was a type of mushroom that was toxic to non- plant creatures .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These mushrooms were speckled with moss and grew in dense clusters. They were not only toxic but highly unstable: walking across a patch without care caused a cloud of poisonous spores to be launched into the air. Destroying a mossy deathcap neutralized its toxic spores.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>These mushrooms infested patches of moss, including oblivion moss .</p>
<p>They could be found underground, such as beneath the Delhalls in Vaasa .</p>
