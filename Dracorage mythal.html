<p>The Dracorage mythal was a magical effect created at the end of the Time of Dragons by High mages of the Fair Folk . This High Magic effect tied a Faerûn -wide mythal to the King-Killer Star .</p>
<h2>Effect</h2>
<p>The Dracorage mythal encompassed roughly a 250,000 square miles (650,000 square kilometers) area where the King-Killer Star was visible over Faerûn and caused all dragon and dragon-blooded creatures to slowly become more agitated and reckless, eventually becoming little more than raging beasts, when the star was actually visible; the phenomenon was known as the Rage of Dragons .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The mythal's effects were first felt in −25,000 DR , possibly from the work of Lady Winterflower Duskmere , though other sources placed the start of the rage in −24,500 DR and in −24,000 DR . At a later date, the dragons retaliated, attacking the capstone en masse; elves successfully defended the location, leaving the area littered with interminable bones millenia later, a large number of which were avariel .</p>
<p>Some years prior to 1373 DR , Sammaster reached the mythal's capstone through a portal hidden in the Novularond mountains. Though he had triggered certain effects as far back as Uktar 9 of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it wasn't until by Hammer 1 of 1373 DR he had completed the alterations, using his own phylactery to bind the mythal itself to energies drawn from the Abyss , which would power it rather than the King-Killer Star : this way, he started a continuous Rage of Dragons.</p>
<p>Eventually, a force of dragons led by King Tamarand , the Talons of Justice , Dorn Graybrook and the wizards of Thentia broke into the heart of the Rage and slew the guardians. Though Sammaster fought them every step of the way, his alterations, alongside the mythal itself were finally broken by Pavel Shemov on Nightal 6 of that year, ending the Rages forevermore.</p>
<h2>Capstone</h2>
<p>Capstone of the Rage Geography Type Ancient elven citadel Region Northernmost Faerûn , nearing North Pole</p>
<p>The heart of the Rage lay within a structure of stone, raised magically, with barbicans, spires, and towers, the terrain around it littered with an incredible amount of avariel and dragon bones hidden in a rocky valley somewhere on the northernmost reaches of the Faerunian continent. The location was so far north that the days were extremely short in comparison with the nights. The area was prowled by at least one ghost dragon . Strange events littered the landscape, the product of much magic and death. There were also remains of a golem or earth elemental; the local flora included lichen, bistort, coltsfoot, and spadderdock. A single portal led from a hidden citadel within the Novularonds to a passage carved into the walls of the valley, allowing for a degree of separation with the fortress housing the mythal itself.</p>
<p>As of 1373 DR, it was protected by six Tarterian dragons in service of Sammaster . The valley was also trapped, afflicting those who attempted to fly out of it with maze . The passage itself was guarded by a dragonbone golem . A ward around the citadel itself transported those who attempted to enter it instead across its whole span, also preventing anyone from teleporting inside.</p>
<p>Some parts of the place had other disturbing effects and an especially virulent pocket of enchantment lay somewhere. The corrupted enchantment in the valley, when it affected Taegan sufficiently, had a similar effect to the microcosm psionic power, creating for Taegan the illusion he'd always just been a highborn rake in Lyrabar with an odd compulsion to climb and jump, which he barely managed to disbelieve in time to avoid hitting the ground after falling from flight due to the illusion.</p>
<p>The dracorage mythal itself was embodied in a room within the citadel, with a silver pentacle inlaid on the ground, with black walls and ceiling on which the night sky had been depicted with gemstones; a gigantic ruby traling carmelians stood in for the King-Killer Star. After Sammaster's meddling in 1373, a number of portals on the room's walls generated color flashes, which were visible from outside the room. The lich had also placed two guardians at the entrance of the room, an ironwyrm golem and a drakestone golem .</p>
