<p>The Pushy Pixie was a friendly and welcoming tavern located in Velarsburg , Harrowdale , during the midâ€“14 th century DR . The rustic alehouse was extremely popular among the local farmers and woodsmen, who were entertained by lowbrow jokes, risque dancers, and crude pranks. Fights were common within the Pixie, and just about every night included pieces of broken furniture that were easily replaced by local woodworkers.</p>
<p>Two priests from the Temple of the Harvest Moon were regularly stationed in the tavern during the evenings to tend to the wounded.</p>
<p>While the dancers in the Pixie were not particularly talented, once a month a group of traveling priests of Sune known as the Flametresses would stop within the tavern and demonstrate their acrobatic abilities. Locals throughout Velarsburg would pack the tavern on these nights.</p>
