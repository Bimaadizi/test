<p>Incarnates were sentient embodiments of the energy of abstract principles.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Incarnates were invisible to other creatures, but if viewed through magical means they appeared to be multi-colored balls of light. Each was composed of the living energy of a certain abstract principle, such as evil, anger, courage, hope, etc.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>All incarnates possessed an immunity to harm from fire , cold, and electricity. All were capable of draining creatures of their constitution by touching them, inducing feelings of weakness in both their victim's body and mind. When the constitution of a creature was completely drained away an incarnate could attempt to take over their victim. Afterwards, a creature's constitution would gradually return to them. The creature's alignment would also immediately, though only temporarily, change to match that of the incarnate possessing them.</p>
<p>Once in control of their body, an incarnate could use its host however it desired â€” actions, speech, spellcasting, etc. They also developed a telepathic bond with them, allowing the host and incarnate to communicate. They also provided their hosts with varied unique abilities. One ability that all incarnates provided their hosts was an immunity to mind-affecting spells .</p>
<p>While inside them a host acted as a buffer between incarnates and enemies, with all attacks against them merely harming the host's body and not the incarnate. In addition, while possessed by an incarnate a creature could not be taken over by other incarnates or spirits, such as ghosts and haunts , nor be affected by magic jar .</p>
<p>Only the death of a host and certain spells could drive an incarnate out from a body. Minor incarnates could be driven out by the spells dispel good or dispel evil and limited wish . Major incarnates could only be driven out from a host by means of exaction , holy word or unholy word , and wish .</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<p>There were over sixteen types of incarnates, divided into two classifications, major and minor, which could be subdivided between the alignment spectrums of good and evil . They could be found across much of the Outer Planes , but gravitated towards planes and planar layers that suited their temperaments and particular alignment.</p>
<p>Good-aligned incarnates rarely attempted to interfere with the behavior of their hosts and avoided taking over creatures that would be harmed by their presence. While evil-aligned incarnates had no such concerns or scruples, caring only that they get as much energy as possible from their host.</p>
<h3>Major</h3>
<p>Within the major classification there were only two types of incarnates, a good and an evil. They could not possess weak creatures without destroying them in the process, the power of their pure energy causing the creature's body to incinerate.</p>
<h3>Minor</h3>
<p>Within the minor classification there were over fourteen types, divided between the alignment spectrums of good and evil. They were both liable to take neutrally aligned creatures as hosts, but would abandon them as soon as possible for someone more appropriately aligned.</p>
<h2>Minor Incarnates</h2>
<h3>Good Minor Incarnates</h3>
<h3>Evil Minor Incarnates</h3>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Incarnates were attracted to energy sources similar to their own substance. Such as angry individuals attracting anger incarnates and courageous individuals attracting courage incarnates.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>Incarnates fed upon the pure energy given off by hosts expressing abstract principles similar to their own substance.</p>
<h3>Homelands</h3>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>Incarnates of both alignment spectrums served a wide variety of deities and pantheons all across the Realms:</p>
