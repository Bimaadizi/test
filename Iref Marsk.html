<p>Iref Marsk was a guard in Heliogabalus as of the late mid-14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was stocky. His hair was "foppishly" barbered, slicked with oil.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>As of the time of his death, he'd bought an amethyst and gold earring.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Iref Marsk was part of the raid on Kosef Demsk 's room the morning he was captured at some point in the 1360s DR.</p>
<p>Nights later, while leaving a brothel, he was followed by Pavel Shemov and Tana Farag , who suspected he had worked to frame Kosef; though he noticed them, they caught up to him. They attempted to beat a confession out of him, but before they could, he was slain by a barghest .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though they never actually managed to prove it, Pavel Shemov and Tana Farag had reason to believe that Iref Marsk had employed some device as he entered Kosef's home to dissolve a duplicate of Kosef's signature weapon which had been swapped for the real thing. However, Pavel had strong reasons to believe it, and that the conspiracy went as high as to involve Glar Chelenov , who would have appointed Iref Marsk to the raid; when he threatened the magistrate with offering this theory to the priests, the magistrate agreed to drop the charges against Kosef, Tana, and Pavel, though the latter two had been clearly guilty of murder and arson at the time as well as being in the magistrate's crosshairs.</p>
