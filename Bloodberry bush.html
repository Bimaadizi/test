<p>Bloodberry bushes grew on the plains surrounding the Battle of Bones .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Reddish-purple berries and heart-shaped reddish-green leaves characterized this bush.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>These bushes were extremely poisonous in every part. Eating just a few of the berries killed most creatures within minutes. Chewing the twigs or brewing the leaves in a tea was similarly deadly. Even using the twigs from this bush in a campfire could prove dangerous, causing eyes to swell shut from the toxic smoke and making food cooked over the fire toxic as well. Surviving the poison still left one seriously sick.</p>
<p>Despite this, bloodberries were reputed to be an ingredient in Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie , which was known to be incredibly tart.</p>
