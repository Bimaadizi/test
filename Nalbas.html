<p>Nalbas was a halfling who dealt in exotic treasures, often found in the Yawning Portal trading with adventurers descending into or leaving Undermountain in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nalbas was a friendly halfling who thought adventuring and especially expeditions to Undermountain to be a dangerous and foolish endeavor. However, it never stooped him from using those adventurers to retrieve precious curiosities for him from the perilous depths of Undermountain.</p>
<p>Spending a lot of time in the Yawning Portal, Nalbas chatted to all sorts of folks and always knew the latest rumors.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In the Yawning Portal, Nalbas sold an odd version of potion of healing to willing adventurers. He claimed that it was as potent as any other potion of the sort but it was bitter-tasting.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1370 DR , Nalbas met the lone adventurer who was sent to Undermountain by Khelben Arunsun to investigate the increased kobold attacks in Waterdeep . The halfling shared the rumors of shadow fiends snatching people from Waterdeep's alleys and dragging them into Undermountain, eating the victims' shadows and transforming them into mindless zombies .</p>
<p>Nalbas won 50 gp when the Khelbenite emerged from the Undermountain alive and well and gained access to the second level of the mega-dungeon. The betting for and against brave and stupid adventurers diving into the depths of danger was one of the halfling's favorite ways of making money.</p>
