<p>Dragon's Eye was a large volcanic structure, identifiable by its huge toothed maw and glowing "eye".</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<h3>First Floor</h3>
<p>The first floor was dimly lit, with few torches scattered around its caverns. Many creatures made Dragon's Eye their home. Trolls , lizardmen , beetles, and several types of spiders resided here. A lizardman king commanded his subjects from his cavern, which was also where the captured villagers from Kuldahar were kept.</p>
<h3>Second Floor</h3>
<p>Similar in its cavernous structure, the second floor contained the same creatures as the first floor, but was also home to some Talonite priests. A huge lair of bombardier beetles could also be found here. A stone dais in a large well-lit cavern stood out, surrounded by clerics of Talona. Mother Egenia , head priestess of Ilmater , was to be sacrificed here.</p>
<h3>Third Floor</h3>
<p>Undead , especially wights , skeletons , and zombies , roamed the area of the third floor. It was littered with traps and wards, and had a pungent stench of rotting flesh. A subterranean river divided the cavern in half, with bridges connecting the two regions. A priestess named Presio made her home here, where she summoned and commanded the restless undead.</p>
<h3>Fourth Floor</h3>
<p>The fourth floor hosted a Temple of Eldath , covered in several tapestries and rugs. The priests of this temple seemed to be non-hostile and allowed visitors to rest and be healed, if they so wished. However, it turned out that this was just a ruse. In fact, the priests were actually lizard men and yuan-ti , in disguise. A high summoner and ritualist, deep within the temple, summoned several waves of such creatures. The high ritualist let slip that Yxunomei , the evil marilith leader, had the Heartstone Gem .</p>
<h3>Final Floor</h3>
<p>The final floor was where Yxunomei resided, and kept the Heartstone Gem. The chambers here held a large array of traps, including poison dart traps. The floor contained a torture chamber, which led to a hidden room. A group of adventurers slew Yxunomei, and recovered the legendary gem.</p>
