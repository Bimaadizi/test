<p>Yujist Glemp was the "almost famous" sculptor from the hamlet of Gillian's Hill , active sometime before 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Yujist Glemp once created and gifted a statue to the good folk of Gillian's Hill that later came to be known as Glemp in Granite . The sculpture was proudly displayed on the streets of the town. Many locals felt that the generous gesture rang hollow as the statue bore resemblance to the sculptor's own face. Eventually, to no one's surprise, an unknown person "improved" the sculpture one night night with a hammer and a chisel . Angered, Glemp stormed around the hamlet, trying to find the "ungrateful peasant" who defaced his masterwork. The sculptor decided to re-bestow the sculpture on the poor inhabitants of Gillian's Hill. The new version was to be a golden reproduction of the sculptor's face, raised on top of a high obelisk, "out of each of their barbarous chisels."</p>
<p>Soon after the ruination of Yujist Glemp's first gift, he mysteriously disappeared before the sculptor had a chance to start working on the new monument to himself. The defaced sculpture was moved away from the decent folks of Gillian's Hill eyesight and into the back of Torleth's Treasures , the local antiques and "junk" shop. Glemp in Granite , as it came to be known, was still in Torleth Mindulspeer 's store as of 1372 DR.</p>
<p>The truth of Glemp's disseverance was somewhat mundane. To finance his golden cast statue, he took a load from notorious shark - Vladmyr of Daggerford. Using that coin , the sculptor purchased barrels worth of what he thought was gold. In reality, it was useless pyrite . Glemp wanted to use his sculpture as a collateral, but with only pyrite on hand, he was in danger. Before Vladmyr could send his collectors, Glemp disappeared, leaving behind his " Barrels of Bamboozle " for the angry loanshark.</p>
