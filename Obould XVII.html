<p>King Obould XVII was the seventeenth king of the Obould dynasty , ruling over the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows in the Silver Marches in the 1470s and early 1480s DR . He reigned from Dark Arrow Keep .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Obould XVII's reign was strong around 1479 DR . At the time, he sent forces to investigate options in the city of Neverwinter . However, the lieutenant he sent to achieve this, a power-hungry orc named Vansi , allied herself with the Abolethic Sovereignty and rather than reporting back to her king, risked turning herself and her warriors into pawns.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , after the Darkening , Obould started to lose control of his chieftains. Soon after, under the orders of Tiago Baenre and Ravel Xorlarrin , he was killed by the drow assassin Belween , who'd disguised himself as the orc prince Lorgru , who had been kidnapped previously.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>As with all his predecessors, Obould XVII inflicted lethal punishments on unruly chieftains. They were sent to battle in the Pit in Dark Arrow Keep; while survival would receive a pardon, Obould XVII gave a slow-acting poison to those he especially wanted to be rid of.</p>
