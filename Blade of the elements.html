<p>The blade of the elements was a magical katana from Kara-Tur that may have appeared in Faerûn in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lord Sunang of Kara-Tur was forced to make alliances and purchase magical weapons like the blade of the elements when his lands were besieged by the forces of a mighty wu-jen . However, this strategy proved very costly: Sunang was near-bankrupted and his influence waned, while his enemy continued to grow in power. Ultimately, Sunang's realm collapsed from its own weaknesses, not to conquest. It was supposed that the profit-hungry merchants supplied arms to both sides, but proof was lost to history.</p>
<p>The blade of the elements may have turned up in the Sword Coast North in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The katana was observed to have a guard, with either a tassel hanging from the guard or a brown cloth wrapped around the lower half of the blade.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A blade of the elements was a +3 katana that could slay an elemental on impact.</p>
