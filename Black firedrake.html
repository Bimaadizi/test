<p>Black firedrakes were the mutant offspring of a black dragon and a fire drake .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>They possessed a breath weapon that was composed of both acid and flame, arising from both sides of their heritage. They had wings that allowed them to fly.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>They would attack opponents with their breath weapons as well as their sharp teeth and claws.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The only known case of this mutant creature being created was when the Thayan Red Wizard Marek Rym√ºt bred them in the 1360s DR while he was a resident of the city of Innarlith . He used the male black dragon great wyrm Insithryllax and female firedrakes in order to create them. The female firedrakes were captured from the north shore of the Lake of Steam.</p>
<p>At first, he ran a hatchery/nursery for them underneath the second quarter of Innarlith, but found problems when he ran out of space and food for them, leading to some of them escaping to the surface and causing destruction in the city.</p>
<p>He later transferred them to a pocket dimension called the Land of One Hundred and Thirteen , where he bred them into an army under his control.</p>
<p>Marek intended to use the army in order to overthrow and replace the Ransar of Innarlith.</p>
<p>This plan reached fruition in 1365 DR , when Marek's puppet, Senator Salatis overthrew Ransar Osorkon with the help the black firedrake army that had been polymorphed into human form.</p>
<p>The black firedrakes served as Salatis's personal bodyguard up until the time when Senator Pristoleph invaded Innarlith with an army and took power for himself. The black firedrakes then turned on Salatis and murdered him themselves before giving themselves over to Pristoleph's command.</p>
