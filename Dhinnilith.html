<p>Dhinnilith , also known as the First City of the Sword , was a phantom city rumored to appear on moonless nights every few years, hovering over the waters of the Vilhon Reach , just north of the Chondalwood .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dhinnilith was the first of the Twelve Cities of the Sword of Jhaamdath , founded in −5750 DR by that empire's psionic rulers. It was supposed destroyed with the rest of Jhaamdath in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR , when the elves used high magic to send a tidal wave in retaliation for the slaughter of the elves of the Chondalwood.</p>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , no explorer had located the ruins of Dhinnilith on the bottom of the Vilhon Reach .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Persistent rumors were spread that Dhinnilith had somehow survived the great destruction of the Year of Furious Waves. It was claimed that a city of phantom stone would rise out of the waters of the Vilhon Reach on moonless nights and vanish before sunrise. The last such sighting occurred in the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR .</p>
<p>While as of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , no adventurer had explored the transient city, the truth was that the city's only remaining inhabitant was a caller in darkness , a ghostly cloud with thousands of human faces, silently screaming in terror and anguish.</p>
