<p>Shaben Shortcloak was a scout for Company Yargo that served aboard the Buccaneer's Tear during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a particularly brave individual that did not let danger get in the way of his appetite for treasure.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shaben was exceptionally skilled at sneaking by others, even when they had the advantage of familiar terrain.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Shaben joined Company Yargo's expedition to the earthmote of Pirates' Skyhold above the Sword Coast North . He and his fellow scouts Thoros and Lili Huntinghawk traveled through the mote's swamps and became separated a short ways before they arrived at Skull Fortress . Thoros believed Shaben became isolated and trapped in the sunken village that surrounded the fort, but in truth the intrepid halfling was merely searching for a way inside to recover the treasure and riches undoubtedly found within.</p>
<p>Thoros and Lili enlisted the aid of the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to help uncover their friend's whereabouts. The adventurer arrived to find Shaben free from harm, searching for any opportunity to recover the fort's treasure. Shaben found nothing of great value, but guessed that it could have been moved within the dungeons below, and offered his new ally just enough information to "convince" them it was worth further investigation.</p>
<p>The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge found more than they bargained for â€“ the depths of Skull Fortress were being used by the undead pirates that originally arrive at the earthmote decades earlier. Take aback by the revelation, Shaben sent work back to Company Yargo at the docked Buccaneer's Tear while the adventurer continued onwards towards the pirates' stronghold of Scoundrel's Retreat .</p>
