<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the function of Crèche Y'llek was repurposed as the githyanki war against the mind flayers in Faerûn shifted in balance. Ch'r'ai W'wargaz arrived at the crèche, leading the inquisition in pursuit of the Astral Prism , a device that imprisoned Orpheus , the long-lost son of Gith . Therezzyn directed her forces at Y'llek to find the prism at once, in service to their queen Vlaakith CLVII .</p>
