<p>The Watchful Knight was popular inn located in the town of Beliard . It earned its name from the centerpiece of its main hall, a suit of armor that sprang to life to guard the inn.</p>
<p>It was run by Arachar Calatharr who, at his insistence was not related to the famous adventurer of the same name .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The inn was built of logs and as such was deathly cold in the winter. It was warmed, as much as possible, by two chimneys located on either end.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Watchful Knight comprised a vast central hall, atop which sat two additional floors of 16 guest rooms. Each of these rooms had an interior balcony that overlooked the inn's first floor.</p>
<p>Right in the center of the main hall was a suit of full plate armor that faced the inn's entrance. This was in fact a helmed horror that obeyed</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time before the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR , the helmed horror vanished from the Watchful Knight. The innkeeper followed suit a brief time later.</p>
