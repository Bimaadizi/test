<p>Spysong was a scouting organization that collected information about threats to the kingdom of Damara .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>In the 14 th Century DR , Spysong operated throughout the Bloodstone Lands on behalf of King Gareth Dragonsbane of Damara. Their primary mission upon their founding in 1359 DR was finding the location and the defenses of the Citadel of Assassins .</p>
<p>As of 1480 DR , Spysong was headed by Riordan Parnell and based out of the Cave of the Whispering Wind in the Galena Mountains . The organization was still active throughout Damara and Vaasa , but had become dedicated to undermining and overthrowing the current King of Damara, Yarin Frostmantle , who they believed to have been behind the death of Queen Brianne Dragonsbane .</p>
<h2>Notable members</h2>
