<p>Al-Oyun , also called The Eyes , referred to a pair of islands found in the Genie's Turban archipelago in the Corsair Domains of northwest Zakhara around 1367 DR .</p>
<p>Al-Oyun and Al-Anf were collectively referred to as the "Beauty Marks" by local corsairs . Ever distrustful of strangers, the corsairs would use the term as a form of password to test outsiders.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Both of these forested islands were similar in size, measuring 30 miles (48 kilometers) in length and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) in width. They were located very close to each other directly southeast of Chaos Bay and the much larger Island of Firethorns . Their position made them appear like "eyes" when viewing the larger scope of the Genie's Turban archipelago.</p>
