<p>Dor Stavask was a criminal mage in Heliogabalus as of the late mid-14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was tow-headed and clean-shaven, with an open, youthful face. He wore a symbol of Bane round his neck and his cloak had a pattern concealing a symbol of Gargauth .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was strangely excited about people being suspicious of him.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was counted both a mage and a skilled cutpurse.</p>
<p>He knew a number of spells, amongst which, most certainly, were burning hands , Laogzed's breath , and Mestil's acid breath . He was strongly suspected of knowing a spell that closely resembled major creation as well as one that closely resembled lesser planar binding , and of having the power to affix a counterspell in some device useable by another.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was known to have involved himself in conspiracies against the king.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The day that Kosef Demsk allegedly killed Mivar Greyman , Quendar Horn had been with him all day. The next day, he was briefly questioned by Pavel Shemov , who suspected that Kosef was set up; Quendar almost got violent, but Tana Farag interceded and removed the priest before his face.</p>
<p>Later, Tana Farag and Pavel Shemov broke into his home; they found evidence that he'd practiced at copying Kosef's signature sword. He attacked them then, and was ultimately slain.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Though it was never conclusively proven, Tana Farag and Pavel Shemov strongly believed that their questioning of Iref Marsk was cut short because of a barghest summoned by Dor Stavask, as he was the one with the opportunity to swap Kosef's sword with a fake and the one whom a barghest would deal with. When they broke into his sanctum, they found evidence he'd been affixing to mind the details of Kosef's sword, making it more likely that he was the one who performed such an act.</p>
