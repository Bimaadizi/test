<p>Shalanka was an eladrin twilight incanter who served as the protector of the so-called Village of the Mad Druid in the Shadowfell as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She was insane and delusional, and as a result, not very perceptive. Living in the Shadowfell had twisted her mind such that she believed living creatures to be abominations and that undead were natural and normal. However, her grasp on reality was tenuous enough that although she believed herself to be the guardian of a village of undead, the inhabitants were in fact living people who merely pretended to be undead to placate her and earn her protection.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She used her powers to manipulate a battle, teleporting herself and her foes or binding and blinding her enemies, all to gain advantage for herself and her minions.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She patrolled the Shadowfell Road just outside the Village of the Mad Druid, attacking and seeking to slay any living travelers with her pack of undead animals.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Although she was dangerous and unstable, Shalanka was appreciated as the defender of the Village of the Mad Druid, and the citizens tried not to upset her as they knew that they would be condemned to death without her.</p>
<p>As of 1479Â DR , Shalanka had come to realize that she was not strong enough to contest either the Thayans who had pacified the Shadowfell Road nor their Netherese rivals, thus she did not attack agents of either realm.</p>
