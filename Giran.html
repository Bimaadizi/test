Unfortunately, the circus' tent fell victim to a mad gnome illusionist Kalah , who transformed the tent's interior into a fanciful tower filled with guests and performers, ensorcelled to appear as monsters. Giran's mother was trapped inside, transformed into a giant spider . The child was left outside of the spellbound tent, crying for his missing mother.
