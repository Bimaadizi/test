<p>Huros was a priest who maintained the shrine of the Watchful Shield in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 14 th century DR, Huros sent a letter out to Allessia Faithhammer , his former pupil, summoning her from her home in Secomber to Baldur's Gate . She would become one of the six heroes to aid the Gate against Mordoc Se Lanmere‎‎ , the vampire villain of the Battle of Bones . While Allessia adventures back in Baldur's Gate, Huros collected copious coin from her to aid orphans, unfortunate, and sick of the city, eventually allowing his pupil to reach the status of a paladin of Helm after serving the church one last time in slaying Goreth Vileblack – a foul cleric of Cyric who was assembling an army of skeletons in the foothills of the Sunset Mountains to attack the town of Asbravn .</p>
