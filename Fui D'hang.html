<p>Fui D'hang was a general of the Shou Lung empire stationed at the Ginger Palace embassy on the Dragon Coast region of Faerûn during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The general wore leather armor that was covered with a large tunic along with a brass helmet lined with silver .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Since the Ginger Palace was first constructed, General Fui served as the commander of the royal guards protecting Princess Wei Dao .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The general had a contentious relationship with Prince Tang, seething with hostilities that always seemed to exist beneath the surface of their banter. While Fui was the superior military commander, the prince believed himself he had the right to secure victory for the empire of Shou Lung.</p>
<p>Fui's son Yuan ti was an officer in the imperial army. The general pulled some strings to have his son stationed with him at the Ginger Palace, a cushy job that would keep allow him to keep an eye on his son.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR , General Fui and his men accompanied Prince Kao Chou Tang on a mission into the nameless swamp in order to slay the dracolich Cypress the Black . During their journey along the waters of the swamp, both the general and the prince, along with their men chewed lasal leaves in order to protect their minds from the undead dragon's powers drawn from the Invisible Art . The leaves had the unintended effects of inciting anger and belligerence within the Shou men.</p>
<p>In his lasal haze, General Fui D'hang questioned the authority of Prince Tang to the point of insubordination, and was punished with an immediate death sentence. The prince inadvertently chose Fui's son Yuan Ti to behead the general. With his father's approval, the young officer followed orders and slew his father before they even reached the dragon's lair.</p>
<p>After his death, Lady Feng sent the apparition of Fui's visage to guide Tang as the prince ventured out alone to save his mother from Cypress. The deceased general guided Tang through the flooded passageways in Cypress' labyrinthine lair as a final act of loyally and dedication to Shou Lung .</p>
