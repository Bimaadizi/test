<p>The High Moors were elevated uncultivated lands that, together with the Farsea Marshes (or Farsea Swamp during the century that followed the Spellplague ), formed the northern frontiers of the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The High Moors, like the rest of Cormyr, received a lot of precipitation every summer and spring and snowfall in winter. The area also was known for commonly occurring mists from where they stretched to the High Horn and the Eveningstar Gorge . The Moors were untamed and largely unexplored lands speckled with ruins of keeps, giants ' castles, and other ancient structures inhabited by the remnants of the once powerful monster communities. Many believed that the High Moors hid ancient secrets of fallen civilizations and mysterious alien elder powers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The High Moors were located in the foothills of the Storm Horn Mountains , on their northern slopes with the Stonelands and the Goblin Marches bordering its northern edge. The Farsea Marshes bordered the Moors' western edge, separated by the Shore of Sorrow .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the glory days of Myth Drannor and when Suzail was still a fledging settlement, circa the Year of Leaping Flames, 200 DR , the Goblin Marches and the High Moors were home to a mighty empire of goblin raiders who successfully ruined nearby kingdoms of Asram and Anauria . When the desert of Anauroch encroached on their lands, the goblins scattered into disjointed tribes, some of which retreated to the High Moors.</p>
<p>At some point before the late 14 th century DR , Maris Khorma Terrabin , a researcher and writer, built a small keep north of the High Moors from whence she traveled across the Moors and the Goblin Marches and collected information on the local species' ecologies.</p>
<p>Sometime circa the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , sages discovered tales of a forgotten city-state that once stood in the Moors. The lore came from a book called the Yielding Tide and talked about how powerful mages trapped a minor female deity underneath the city in an attempt to siphon her divine powers. It was believed that the goddess was still trapped under the ruins in the late 14 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The only active human group that maintained its presence in the High Moors was the Black Network, the Zhentarim that moved its caravans across the Goblin Marches. A beholder Zhent ally named Zantiid had his lair hidden somewhere in the High Moors from whence he emerged to patrol the Stonelands. Apart from the Zhentarim, the High Moors had minor holds of power established by the region's goblins. Goblin trilbies, the Neidlig , tribe of six hundred, and the Fenlis â€“ hunted and laired on the High Moors.</p>
<p>The region was inhabited by griffons who were believed to have a central lair in a cave somewhere near the High Moors north of the Castle Kilgrave . Copper dragons inhabited the Storm Horns near the edge of the High Moors, with hieracosphinxes inhabiting the areas closer to the border's center, and hill giants claimed the eastern side of the region.</p>
