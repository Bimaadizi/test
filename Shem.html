<p>Shem was a gambler. In 1374Â DR , he played Three-Dragon Ante against Yasha and Warian Datharathi somewhere north of Cathyr in Dambrath ; the last hand was interrupted by Bui the Hog , who chose that moment to pick a fight with Warian. He did not take part in the ensuing fight; when Warian finished the battle, victorious, Shem did not contest him taking the accumulated pot.</p>
