<p>The Umar Witch Project Journal was a copy of an allegedly true journal that was once kept by victims of the infamous Umar Witch of Imnesvale , distributed to visitors of the town in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Copies of the Umar Witch Project Journal were heavy, 3‑pound (1.4‑kilogram) books bound in a fanciful gray cover decorated with an image of a pentagram.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This unreservedly truthful and authentic journal was maintained by an apprentice wizard as she traversed the wilderness of the Umar Hills. She was accompanied by two fellow apprentices, Joshellus and Michaelus , on the journey to find evidence of the fabled Umar Witch's existence for their master. The journal's entries were, reportedly, hard to believe. They chronicled the trio's dismay after getting lost in the hills and being hounded by some unseen creature every night. The later parts of the Umar Witch Project Journal were written in a panicky, feminine script that ended abruptly after the following passage: "...sorry to Joshellus's mother. I'm sorry about what happened to Michaelus. There's something out here with us. We thought it to be peasants, but peasants aren't this clever. Joshellus says it's the witch. I hear her when I sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want..."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These journals could be procured from Vincenzo , the innkeep of the Umar Inn in Imnesvale in the late 14 th century DR. All guests that stayed at the inn, be they passersby, caravan traders, or thrill seekers, received an earful of the Umar Witch's legend from Vincenzo. The innkeeper claimed that the Umar Witch Project Journal came from a group of wizards who headed for the Umar Hills some years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . Vincenzo told visitors that he himself discovered the original journal in the woods of the Umar Hills. A local youth, Willet the Stableboy, corroborated the story by saying that the said mages were good people. Vincenzo claimed that he commissioned "a copy or two" from his scribe friends. In reality, one of the inn's back rooms was filled with copies of the Umar Witch Project Journal .</p>
