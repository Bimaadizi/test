<p>Quantoul was a popular and prolific spell-inventor of ancient Netheril and the founder of the enclave of Jockteleg .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As an arcanist , Quantoul had a supreme interest in altering the makeup of matter, and his focus was therefore in variation magic.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Quantol was born in the Netheril Year 1812, which corresponded to −2047 DR . He was primarily active as an inventor from the year of −2028 DR until −2017 DR , during which time he created numerous spells, at least a dozen of which were commonly used throughout the spheres . Among these were spells such as haste and polymorph self .</p>
<p>In −2019 DR , Quantoul founded the enclave of Jockteleg . The flying city became a center for the study of the arcane arts, particularly of the school of variation . This led to Quantoul's promotion to the ranks of the archwizards , and after 60 years from its founding, visiting arcanists from all over the empire flooded its streets.</p>
<p>In −1932 DR , Quantoul's magical studies focused around the mythallar of his city. He sought a means to allow the citizens of Jockteleg to polymorph themselves at will. However, his efforts failed drastically, as the modifications to the mythallar instantly transformed all of the city's inhabitants into voadkyn .</p>
<p>Quantoul tried desperately to repair the change to himself and his citizens but never could find a means to reverse the magic. His original fear that everyone would lose their sanity turned out to be unfounded; indeed, everyone maintained their original minds and personalities, provided that they never left the range of the mythallar .</p>
<p>For centuries, Quantoul remained on Jockteleg to lead his polymorphed people, extending his life by longevity magics, all the time seeking a cure for his mistake. He never succeeded, and he and his people remained in the form of voadkyn until the Fall of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Some believed that Quantoul actually survived the destruction of his city and that his mind still existed in some other form, but most eventually forgot the name of the great archwizard.</p>
