<p>Shocktroop devils were brutal devils of the Nine Hells , assault troops that charged directly into battle to smash through enemy armies.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shocktroop devils were heavily armored and imposing figures, the ground trembling beneath their steps.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Shocktroops devils were unusually blunt for their kind, tending away from subtlety and towards straightforward violence and unrelenting bloodlust, though they were still reasonably intelligent.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Individually, shocktroop devils were able to act as one-man armies, singlehandedly inflicting massive casualties on the enemy. Despite their armor and size, they could fly even faster than they ran. Prolonged combat put them at a disadvantage however, as they could only perform their most devastating attacks when uninjured. The power of Asmodeus protected them from divine power until they were sufficiently weakened, at which point they were notably vulnerable to it.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Shocktroop devils began engagements slamming into their targets like metal battering rams, throwing foes off balance, smashing them aside, and leaving them in a daze. Their attacks broke up enemy charges and shattered their formations, making it of tactical benefit to hurt them before they could barrel into the fight. If other forces were present to hold the line and they seemed to be losing, they might make a tactical retreat to rest and regroup before making another shock assault.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Shocktroop devils were the frontline soldiers and bodyguards in infernal forces, using their hell-forged equipment to deal quick death to their enemies. Anyone who promised perpetual combat and threatened strict discipline was someone a shocktroop devil would be willing to work for.</p>
