<p>A celestial charger was a breed of celestial unicorn from the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia or the Grove of the Unicorns , the divine realm of Mielikki .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Celestial chargers were champions for the cause of good and powerful defenders of peaceful forests and those who inhabited them.</p>
<p>It was common for celestial chargers to become clerics , using divine magic to support their noble causes.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Besides the innate magical powers shared with common unicorns, celestial chargers were resistant to harm from acid , cold , electricity , and spells . The most powerful among them were also resilient against attacks from mundane weapons.</p>
<p>Like all celestial creatures, an attack from one against an evil foe could sometimes cause more increased harm than the same blow would inflict on a non-evil creature.</p>
