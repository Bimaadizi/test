<p>The Wand of Orcus was the primary weapon of the demon lord Orcus .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The wand was a black obsidian and iron rod topped with the skull of a human hero once slain by Orcus. It was considered a Major Artifact .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If wielded in melee the wand functioned as a +6 unholy chaotic heavy mace . If a non-outsider, or an outsider (except very powerful ones) touched the wand, there was a chance he or she would die immediately.</p>
<p>The wielder of the Wand of Orcus could call upon each of the following powers once per day:</p>
<h2>Destruction</h2>
<p>The Wand of Orcus was once destroyed by Gareth Dragonsbane and party after they traveled to the Abyss and stole it from Orcus using advice from Saint Sollars . Bahamut directed them to the only method of its destruction, which was to immerse the wand in the black blood of Tiamat 's heart.</p>
<p>The adventurers used the heart of Tiamat's avatar, which proved just as effective, but Bahamut admitted that the Wand of Orcus would eventually return to existence in one century.</p>
<p>After being destroyed in Tiamat's blood, the heart of the wand was left behind in the form of a small white gem. This gem was planted in the courtyard of Palace Dragonsbane in Bloodstone Village and grew into a tall white tree with golden leaves. The Tree-Gem of Bloodstone prevented demons from entering Bloodstone.</p>
