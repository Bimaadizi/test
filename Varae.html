<p>Vaerae (sometimes spelled Varae ) was an obscure demipower that was subsumed and made an aspect of Sseth .</p>
<h2>Cult</h2>
<p>Vaerae's cult was popular in northern rural Calimshan and the Vilhon Reach , having been brought to those areas by nomadic tribes that were normally found on the Shining Plains . These cults held that no snake should ever be injured; the punishment for harming a snake was maiming, and the punishment for killing a snake was being killed in return.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vaerae was first worshiped during the Fifth Age of Calimsham in a beast cult amongst nomadic humans; there was also some evidence in the North, found in the Farsea Marshes and the Vast Swamp , that he was worshiped under the name Repra as well during that time.</p>
<p>During the Time of Troubles , however, Vaerae was severely weakened and subsequently was slain by Sseth, who saw the new aspect as a way to expand his influence and acquire more power in Toril. He granted new powers to Vaerae's priests, and sent yuan-ti purebloods from the Chultan Peninsula to infiltrate and assume control of the cults. The cults proved capable of providing valuable support to yuan-ti agents in the area, and the yuan-ti in turn spread the cult's influence.</p>
<p>One group of cultists traveled further north in search of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun . However, they were all turned into ophidians after they accidentally unleashed an artifact that was originally created by House Orogoth .</p>
