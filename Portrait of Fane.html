<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This portrait was an exquisite work of art. Its subject was a skeletal creature in a red cloak , enveloped in green swirling spell energy. The undead was so life-like it almost felt like its empty eye sockets followed those who looked at the painting, judgmentally.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Portrait of Fane was found within the ancient and abandoned Temple of Jergal in the Western Heartlands , after the structure was broken into by Gimblebock and his scavenger crew.</p>
