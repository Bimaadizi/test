<p>A cloak of echoes was a cursed enchanted item that appeared to be a cloak of elvenkind to the unwary.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This magical cloak functioned exactly like a cloak of elvenkind for the vast majority of the time. However, if the wearer was deliberatly trying to remain silent while moving, the cloak of echoes would magnify any noise made by the wearer, causing the sound to echo loudly. A cloak of echoes would also emit a loud cry every time it was removed.</p>
