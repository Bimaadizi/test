<p>Thoqqua ( pronounced : /ˈ θ ɑː k w ɑː / THAK-wa ), also called rock worms , were worm-like elementals native to the Elemental Plane of Fire . They were favored by the orc goddess Luthic and the gnome deity Urdlen .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A thoqqua's long body was hot enough to melt rock. Thoqqua had no internal organs, being made purely of the elements of fire and earth .</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Thoqqua were foul-tempered. They spent most of their time burrowing underground in search of minerals to eat.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Thoqqua used their bodies to slam their enemies. This was particularly effective because the touch of a thoqqua resulted in fire damage.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Thoqqua were natives of the Elemental Plane of Fire or, possibly, the Paraelemental Plane of Magma . However, they also dwelt on the Elemental Plane of Earth and in the Underdark on Toril , where they did particulary well in volcanic regions of the Lowerdark .</p>
<p>They were usually found alone or in pairs. Two percent of the population of Earth's End were thoqqua; the place was a launching point for adventurers who wanted to discover peculiar metal and gems of the Lowerdark.</p>
