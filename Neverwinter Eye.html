<p>The Neverwinter Eye , also known as the Eye & Tears , was a symbol popularized in the city of Neverwinter in the late 14 th century DR , and still retained its presence in the late 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Neverwinter Eye was a blue image of an eye with a thin-slit pupil, topped with two sets of horns, two horns on the bottom, and three tears dripping underneath. It was believed in Neverwinter that the weeping eye offered protection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the Neverwinter Eye dated back to the tumultuous year of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , when the Wailing Death plague ravaged the Jewel of the North, immediately followed by the betrayal of the city by its paragon, Aribeth de Tylmarande and a short war with Luskan that shook the city's economy. After the plague and the war ended. The city began to rebuild, and the blue image of a weeping eye, the Eye & Tears started popping up in the city, with the locals believing it to be a symbol of protection. As such, it became a new popular design to be tattooed , especially by sailors and salty dogs of Neverwtiner. One tattooist parlor of note that offered Neverwinter Eye tattoos was Rusty Al's Tattoo & Pawn located in the Docks District , one of the places damaged by the plague.</p>
<p>By the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the Neverwinter Eye in white on a blue background was adopted by the Neverwinter Nine as part of their uniform. Members of the Nine wore a blue tunic adorned with the sign over their ceremonial armor . The Eye was worn by Sir Nevalle , a trusted aide of Lord Nasher Alagondar , and Darmon , who led the city guard in the late 14 th century DR. The weeping eye-decorated uniform was still in use during and several years after the war with the King of Shadows that further damaged Neverwintran economy.</p>
<p>The Neverwinter Eye was immortalized as a part of the monument dedicated to Nasher Alagondar that was erected in front of the Neverwinter arena , adorning his belt . The Neverwinter arena was reopened in the late 1490s DR.</p>
