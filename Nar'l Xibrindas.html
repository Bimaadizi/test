<p>Nar'l Xibrindas ( pronounced : /ˈ n ɑːr ʊl z ɛ ˈ b r ɪ n d ɑː s / NAR-ul zeh-BRIN-das ) was the wizard advisor of the Xanathar in Waterdeep during the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Usually Nar'l was in the audience chamber inside the Xanathar's lair.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The family's house was destroyed and only Nar'l and his elder brother Soluun survived. They decided to join Bregan D'aerthe .</p>
<p>In 1491 DR , Nar'l was assigned a mission to infiltrate the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild and get closer to the beholder crime lord. Nar'l was so successful that he became the only advisor of the Xanathar.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR , however, Nar'l was worried about the growing paranoia of the beholder, who'd started to suspect something about the drow. Jarlaxle too believed that Nar'l was double-crossing Bregan D'aerthe and was willingly working with the beholder.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Nar'l was a nervous individual. He always chose his personal safety over that of his allies. He had with him a secret poison to blind the Xanathar.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Nar'l had always at his side a grell bodyguard assigned by the Xanathar; the grell had secret orders to dispose of the drow if it saw signs of disloyalty.</p>
