<p>Bantakent was a wealthy merchant family of low moral fiber that included a married power-couple that resided in the city of Neverwinter in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 1490s DR , the Bantakent manse in Neverwinter fell under attack by the "faceless dead", an incorporeal evil that sent the servants running for their lives and cornered Lord and Lady Bantakent, menacing them with floating vases and flying about Miffles , Lady Bantakent's dear terrier .</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the terrified merchant couple, what menaced them was no undead apparition but a young girl armed with a pendant of invisibility . Kira , the girl, was an ingenious distraction while her father Edgin Darvis cleaned the manor's upper levels of its valuables. The thieves got away with the heist and returned to the town of Targos unbothered by the city guard.</p>
