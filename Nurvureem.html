<p>Nurvureem , also known as the "Dark Lady" , was a draa'zekyl shadow dragon with a fell reputation among the inhabitants of the Dessarin River Valley . She maintained several different lairs, though she favored the ruined manor-house of Rundreth Manor .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>As of the 15 th century DR took on the persona of enigmatic and beautiful drow woman, referred to by locals as "the Dark Lady".</p>
<p>She did not abide disruptive visitors and cared little for those who tried to ingratiate themselves as allies.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Nurvureem had a predilection for young, handsome male humans . She enticed them to her by using illusions to appear as a beautiful woman wearing very little in the way of clothing. Those who remained peaceful might be allowed to leave alive, often after falling in love with her.</p>
<p>Though if she discovered that these so-called "Faithful Few" had spread her secrets (such as in the case of the bard Inder Braelen , who wrote a ballad about her), those men quickly disappeared. Most men however, were eaten as not only did she enjoy the company of young human men, she also particularly enjoyed the taste of their meat.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nurvureem was born in the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241 DR shortly after her mother was captured by the malaugrym . Nurvureem was the daughter of Mauzzkyl Jaezred , the Patron Grandfather of the Jaezred Chaulssin but she was lost when the kidnappers were killed by Jaezred Chaulssin assassins .</p>
<p>Nurvureem was not noted in history again until the Year of the Stag, 1304 DR when she was discovered roaming the lands southeast of Triboar between there and the borders of the High Forest . She slew at least three other dragons and many more wyverns before she was discovered by the Jaezred Chaulssin in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . The drow let her be, content to observe her until they detected a threat or the possibility of their history being exposed through her.</p>
<p>In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Nurvureem succumbed to the Rage of Dragons , killing several dragon cultists who had come to try and transform her into a dracolich before destroying the village of Uluvin . After the Rage had passed, she aided Cult rebels in Yartar to drive out their leaders, Pox and Saurglyce , before informing the local authorities of their presence a few months later.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , elemental cultists approached her to propose an alliance. She declined the offer and devoured most of them, letting a few live to report their failure. Though curious about the cults, she wanted simply to be left alone.</p>
