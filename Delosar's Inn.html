<p>Delosar's Inn was a tavern in Athkatla .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Delosar's was a large tavern, manned by a bartender named Calbor . It was scarce on entertainment, and folks usually only went there to drink. It was particularly frequented by city guards. The inn was known for being short-staffed, mainly because the off-duty guards would cause problems, and Calbor would scare off the serving wenches.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern was located in the Center District of Athkatla.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>Though the tavern was old, it was kept in good condition. It had three floors of medium size. The bar room was located on the bottom floor, which contained sets of tables and chairs and serving maids. The second floor was a bedding area, containing eight beds and chests. Mercenaries, especially those of Riatavin , would spend time here. The top floor was mainly filled with either sailors or nobles. It was the most comfortable room of the three and contained four luxury beds and a large dining table.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The inn was mainly a "drinking hole" for everyone from guards to nobles. The bar sold beverages such as mead, ale, and wine. If patrons got too drunk, the barman would chuck them out onto the road. There was, however, a "blue elf" wild mage who would perform for a range of customers about his woes. He was very well received but was eventually hunted down by Red Wizards of Thay for his magical talents.</p>
