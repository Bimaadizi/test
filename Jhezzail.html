<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Jhezzail did her best to be friendly and polite, even in uncomfortable situations. She was remarkably brave and composed for her age, even in the face of high priests and werewolves .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Jhezzail was usually tasked with sentry duty at Moonshadow Hall 's main gate, which mainly involved greeting or turning away visitors.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jhezzail was on sentry duty when Feena Archwood arrived to aid High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar . Later, she stonewalled High Luck Colle Shoondeep at the gates of the temple, facing his outraged demands for entry with admirable calm.</p>
<p>She was unfortunate enough to witness the bloody aftermath of Dhauna's attempt to force Feena to infect herself with lycanthropy , and followed Feena's instructions to use belladonna on the victim. She was then assigned to guard Feena's room, but was overcome by the more experienced priestess by charming and paralysis magic, allowing Feena to bind and gag her, then escape the temple.</p>
