<p>Tintibulus was the third layer of Acheron . It was a mostly deserted expanse of loudly colliding boulders of different shapes and sizes, which often attracted magical researchers for its remoteness and isolation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike the top layers of Avalas and Thuldanin , the blocks of Tintibulus were not exclusively shaped like cubes. Rather, regular solids of other shapes were often found floating in the layer, with eight- and twelve-sided blocks being common, although any number of sides was possible. The solids were composed of gray volcanic stone, coated with a layer of ash-like dust of varying depths.</p>
<p>Collisions were frequent throughout the layer, carving hexagon-shaped crevices on the solids along naturally occurring fault lines and breaking the solids up into smaller shapes. Those collisions produced a constant ringing sound that could be loudly heard across the entire layer, in many cases impairing communication.</p>
