<p>Inthracis was an ultroloth necromancer who lived in Corpsehaven in the Blood Rift . He was the commander of the Black Horn Regiment , an elite army 500 strong.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Inthracis was a clone and kept clones of himself in reserve for his death.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1373 DR , Inthracis was approached by the god Vhaeraun , who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the Yor'thae (Chosen of Lolth): Quenthel Baenre , Danifae Yauntyrr , and Halisstra Melarn . As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis reached the Demonweb Pits at the Pass of the Soulreaver and there battled Quenthel, Danifae, Halisstra, Jeggred Baenre , and Pharaun Mizzrym . They defeated the regiment, however, and Inthracis was killed by Pharaun. His death was not permanent, however, as he had another clone body to revive in.</p>
