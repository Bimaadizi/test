<p>The Straits of Koryo were the channels of water lying between the Koryo Peninsula and the island of Saishu and the other small islands between them.</p>
<h2>Tides</h2>
<p>The Straits of Koryo were famed for their huge tidal ranges and speeds: the water could rise a distance of 30 feet (9.1 meters) in only two hours. Low tide exposed the sea bed by the shore.</p>
<h2>Fauna</h2>
<p>The Straits of Koryo were home to prides of sea lions that menaced sailors, and huge orange crabs called dikanie .</p>
<h2>Hazards</h2>
<p>When the tide went out, an unwary sailor could find their boat beached for hours in the mud. Worse, they became prey for the dikanie.</p>
<p>Notorious pirates Crow Dz Pong and Rantoon Gwa plied the Straits of Koryo, harassing the coast between Pyong Do and the Ziyero Ridge .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The fishermen of In'ani and Ansong , on either side of the Straits of Koryo, had eliminated the dangerous prides of sea lions before 1357 DR . For this and other achievements, they were claimed to be the best in the world.</p>
