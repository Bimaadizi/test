<p>The Citizens' Brigade of Port Nyanzaru in Chult was a volunteer militia who protected the city's outlying slums against attacks from the jungle as of the late 15 th century DR . In times of crisis, it was also the closest thing that Port Nyanzaru had to a standing army.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Citizens' Brigade was formed to watch for and defend against dangers to the slums outside of Port Nyanzaru's defensive walls, including Malar's Throat , the Old City and Tiryki Anchorage . They were the first and sometimes only line of defense for the people living in these wards as the mercenaries hired by the merchant princes of the city mainly protected the walls.</p>
<p>The Brigade patrolled the streets and kept watch for attacks from the jungle, including from undead and pterafolk . When an attack was spotted, they sounded horns to warn the residents to flee for the safety of the city's walls. Some members of the Brigade might stay behind to defend their wards.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The Citizens' Brigade had a good relationship with the Emerald Enclave , whose members—notably the tabaxi Screaming Wind —would fight alongside them to protect Malar's Throat.</p>
<p>The Brigade received funding from Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Concurrent with the events of the Death Curse , Malar's Throat came under attack from an alliance of pterafolk and grungs wielding a piece of the Dreamer's Amulet . They captured people for sacrifice—including the elf Siela —and carried them into the jungle. The Citizens' Brigade stood against these attackers and sent a rescue party, including the tabaxi Ashen Rock , to pursue them.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Citizens' Brigade was made up of volunteer civilians from Port Nyanzaru's slums.</p>
