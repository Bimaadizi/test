<p>The Republic of Tivaan was a merfolk republic on the Hmur Plateau , beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars , that formed out of rebellion against the oppressive king of Thalorlyn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In −1455 TS (−1525 DR) , in the midst of the Third Serôs War , a group of spies discovered that Coronal Essyl Merynth of the Aryselmalyr Empire and King Kyron of Thalorlyn were secretly allied with a trio of fiendish krakens for further power. This revelation led to the formation of the Republic of Tivaan. Despite the power of their kraken allies and the artifact known as the Emerald Eye , the rebels managed to depose Kyron and his loyalists a year later. They were all banished from the Hmur Plateau, disestablishing Thalorlyn and having the Republic of Tivaan take its place.</p>
<p>Having lost his puppet state, the focus of the Third Serôs War shifted as Coronal Essyl began sending his forces against the upstart republic. In −1452 TS (−1522 DR) , the republic would forge an alliance against Aryselmalyr with the Arcana of Humbar , a usually isolationist nation of morkoths .</p>
<p>Deposed from the Thalorlyn throne, but still an ally to the Coronal, the exiled King Kyron sought to create a new center of power for himself. He and his loyalists constructed the temple of Vynagyr along the slopes of the Nalaan Plateau , finishing it in −1453 TS (−1523 DR) , and dedicated it to Those Who Sleep Below . From his new base of power Kyron worked together with Essyl to forge alliances with various evil creatures of the Inner Sea, including morkoths and scrags , hoping the addition of such forces could help them to quell the rebellions against Aryselmalyr.</p>
<p>In −1439 TS (−1509 DR) , the first Passing of the shalarin occurred, as the Wildtide Portal and shalarin flooded into the Inner Sea from the Sea of Corynactis . The newcomers were quickly attacked by the forces of Essyl and Kyron, with the added aid of their Emerald Eye . The Republic of Tivaan, the Dukars of Myth Nantar , and the Arcana of Humbar would quickly rush to the aid of the shalarins and summarily forge an alliance with them against Aryselmalyr.</p>
<p>In −1436 TS (−1506 DR) , the Dukars would finally slay the mad exiled king and take his Emerald Eye into custody. His loyalists then divided, with some joining the Republic of Tivaan and others maintaining their allegiance to Coronal Essyl. The Third Serôs War would eventually come to an end in −1432 TS (−1502 DR) . From then on the Republic maintained peaceful relations with the other nations of Serôs .</p>
<p>Years later in −1399 TS (−1469 DR) , the Fourth Serôs War began as a massive horde of merrows and koalinths invaded the Hmur Plateau. Their numbers too great to overcome, they overran the Plateau and brought about the fall of the Republic of Tivaan. Feeling desperation, a mermaid stole the Emerald Eye from one of the towers of the Dukars, believing the powerful artifact could drive away the invaders. However, she became corrupted by the Emerald Eye , taken over by what some believed to be the spirit of King Kyron contained within the artifact.</p>
<p>With her mind corrupted by the Emerald Eye , the mermaid imposed herself upon the invaders, declaring them to be the Second Kingdom of Kyron and becoming their leader in a continued conquest of the Hmur Plateau. The war would eventually come to an end in −1396 TS (−1466 DR) , with the possessed mermaid killed and the Emerald Eye taken back into the custody of the Dukars. The mermaid's body would be buried in the Plains of Duna, subsequently renamed the Haunted Plains , and the Kingdom of Thalvan would be founded as the successor to the Republic of Tivaan by King Darmox .</p>
