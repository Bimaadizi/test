<p>Starwheels , also known as wheel locks or wheel-locks , were a type of pistol and a further development of arquebuses that originated somewhere beyond Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Unlike arquebuses, which had a match-lock mechanism, starwheels had a saw-edged wheel firing mechanism and trigger. This saw-edged wheel would be wound up in a spring, with a piece of either flint or pyrite held against it in a vise.</p>
<p>Starwheels typically weighed around 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>When its trigger was pressed, the pistol's wheel would spin and shower sparks into the enclosed pan where the smokepowder was held.</p>
<p>This weapon required only a single hand to operate and inflicted rather little damage, but compensated with an improved ability to aim accurately.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<h2>Prices</h2>
<p>On Toril in the mid–14 th century DR , a starwheel typically cost around 1,000 gold pieces .</p>
<p>In many areas of Wildspace , these pistols would cost around 700 gold pieces, but on the Rock of Bral they sold for only 400 gold pieces.</p>
