<h2>History</h2>
<p>Hesta was born on Alturiak 7 of the Year of Spilled Blood, 1315 DR to Hetta Debrinne Matrell and Obiron Matrell I .Growing up, Hesta, along with her three siblings Obril , Dregaul , and Xaphira Matrell were ostracized by noble families of Arrabar for being a young merchant house with no social weight behind their name. The fact only aggravated by the fact that Matrells were created by the bastard-born of House Mestel . Hesta's life was cut short on Kythorn 28 of the Year of the Worm, 1356 DR .</p>
