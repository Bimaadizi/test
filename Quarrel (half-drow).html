<p>Quarrel was a half-drow warlock who feverishly pursued magical might and attention of the infamous warlock Ammon Jerro in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Quarrel had dark grey skin, wild black eyes, and white hair.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Quarrel's personality was a volatile mixture of confident displays of power and insecurity. Quarrel was obsessed with his fellow warlock Ammon Jerro, who played a role in the recent Shadow War in Neverwinter .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Quarrel was armed with a unique enchanted mace that shared his fiery personality, and a set of leathers , supposedly stitched together out of armor once worn by the half-drow's warlock hero.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Quarrel's quest for arcane power and pursuit of Ammon Jerro's legacy brought him to the small swamp town of West Harbor just as it was taken hostage by a duo of Harbor Mead -loving black dragons – Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor . By that time, Quarrel had already gained some significant arcane powers from dealings with demons and devils and seen things that would terrify the stoutest hearts. When the dragons arrived, Quarrel foolishly confronted the wyrms, bragging about his great powers to Voaraghamanthar's and Waervaerendor's amusement. The dragons laughed in Quarrel's face and tossed him with other villages to work in West Harbor's brewery, supplying the thirsty wyrms with their favorite mead . This mockery wounded Quarrel's vulnerable pride.</p>
<p>When a group of adventurers who partnered with a merchant princess Sa'Sani arrived in West Harbor, forging new trade routes for her mercantile empire, Quarrel took the opportunity to join them and travel to the Crossroad Keep . The fortress was the center of Sa'Sani's merchant business in Northwest Faerûn and another significant step in Ammon Jerro's history worthy of study.</p>
<p>Luckily, the half-drow did find some first-hand information about Jerro. The Crossroad Keep's seneschal at the time was Khelgar Ironfist , who, in fact, spent some time traveling alongside the famed Knight-Captain and Ammon Jerro. To Quarrel's fury, Khelgar mockingly talked about how his group defeated Jerro at his strongest in the warlock's hidden haven. The drow refused to believe such preposterous claims. All things considered, keep's books, stories, and information Quarrel collected were worth his time. He concluded that in order to learn Jerro's power, he had to do what the older warlock did – join with a power he respected, the group of Sa'Sani's adventurers, becoming a permanent member of the group, despite moral disagreements between them. The alliance would eventually let Quarrel learn and gain more power.</p>
<p>As part of the adventuring company, Quarrel faced with the yuan-ti plot of the Snaketongue cult to cripple the Sword Coast economy and Sa'Sani's business, eventually confronting the interloper deity Zehir in the jungles of Samarach . After the crisis was over, Quarrel returned to the Crossroad Keep to continue his accumulation of power and learning; however, that did not last. Eventually, the half-drow found out that his hero, Ammon Jerro, resurfaced somewhere in the far eastern nation of Thay . Quarrel immediately headed there, leaving the Crossroad Keep forever.</p>
