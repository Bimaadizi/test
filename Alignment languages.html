<p>The Alignment languages , also known as the Alignment tongues , were nine distinct manners of speaking that each corresponded to one of the nine alignments . Despite the name, they were not full languages, but rather shorthand codes of various words, phrases, and gestures that were divinely implanted in the minds of all creatures by the various powers of the multiverse .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The nine alignment languages could only communicate basic things. These included expressing acceptance or disagreement, expressing emotions, and the concepts or dogma that were central to the alignment. For example, the lawful alignment tongues could express matters of administration and justice, someone of the true neutral tongue might state "all things are best balanced", whilst someone speaking in one of the chaotic alignment tongues might state "obedience to order stultifies". Beyond just words, all of the alignment tongues included some elements of sign language .</p>
<p>Most creatures innately possessed one of these alignment tongues, but for most this knowledge was only on a subconscious level. Unusually, alignment tongues were completely absent in the land of Zakhara and they were completely unknown to the korobokuru of Kara-Tur . Those who were conscious of their alignment tongue had at some point "unlocked" that self-awareness by recognizing congruity in the speech of those with a like-minded alignment.</p>
<p>Usually, only those of the corresponding alignment knew and understood alignment tongues, and thus they were a way to identify others of the same alignment. However, it was considered customary to speak alignment tongues only with those one knew. If one were to loudly speak it in public, or with strangers, those of differing alignments who could recognize it would see it as distasteful or offensive, while those of opposing alignments might consider it an act of hostility.</p>
