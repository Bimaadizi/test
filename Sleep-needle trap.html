<p>Sleep-needle traps were a type of trap in common use for household security across Turmish by the 1360s DR. They were developed by the apothecary Phindal of Gildenglade .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Of simple design, they comprised thorns dipped in a clear waxy oil that dried to a soft, crumbly texture.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>On contacting exposed skin, the unidentified poison could cause a person who could not resist to fall unconscious for a few minutes. The coating was effective for up to five such contacts and the effect was cumulative, with multiple contacts making the victim more likely to succumb.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Used in houses and stables, these could be concealed in locks, doorframes, and window frames and other places where an unwary thief would put their hand.</p>
