<p>The corruption of nature was a magical device similar to an Eberronnian rune arm , recovered from the Eveningstar War Hospital in the mid-1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The corruption of nature could be used to shoot bolts of magical corrosive acid , and further increased the potency of the wielder's acid-related spells. It also innately toughened their skin against damage and could help them make quick calculations.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The device was found in the Eveningstar War Hospital during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar . The plague spread by the unfortunate red musk zombie Peron Uthe affected the device as well, causing it to carry a weakened, benign, and persistent form of the red musk creeper disease that passed to the wielder and actually benefited them somewhat.</p>
