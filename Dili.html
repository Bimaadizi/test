<p>Dili was an inmate who was held within the Spellhold asylum in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . She was unique in that she wasnot imprisoned for her mental instability, but rather her unique magical talents.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Despite having been brought up as a test subject in Spellhold, Dili was a cheerful, friendly, and welcoming little girl. Her most notable oddity was that she did not seem to understand that her shapeshifting powers, which she referred to as "taking somebody's face", were rather unnatural. This could have been attributed to her very young age.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>From a remarkably young age, Dili was able to intuitively shape magical energy, presumably of the transmutation school. This enabled her to voluntarily transform into any form that she desired, with known forms including: a duplicate of both Abdel Adrian , the asylum's director , a common house cat , a giant spider , and a gibberling .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dili's polymorphing powers manifested at a very young age, and frightened her parents immensely. Ultimately, they grew so fearful of the child that they abandoned her to the care of the Cowled Wizards , who secreted her away in Spellhold to study her intuitive shapeshifting.</p>
<p>As of 1369 DR, Dili was still a young girl. When Abdel Adrian arrived to free his sibling Imoen , Dili was among the inmates who rallied behind the Bhaalspawn and tried to destroy their tormentor. She was apparently killed in the battle.</p>
