<p>The River Gauros was a relatively short river in northeastern Thay that flowed from the Sunrise Mountains , down the First Escarpment into the River Mulsantir in the Gorge of Gauros . Unlike the other waterways of Thay, this river was only partially navigable and offered little economic or tactical value to the nation's ruling tharchs and zulkirs .</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>There was little to no plant or animal life that could be found within the River Gauros.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During an ill-fated invasion of Rashemen on Mirtul 5 , 1375 DR , the Red Wizards serving under Tharchions Azhir Kren and Homen Odesseiron temporarily impeded the flow of the icy river with their magic , in an effort to march Thayan legions across the Gorge of Gauros. However, the Witches of Rashemen countered their spells , and sent the waters raging at the soldiers caught in its path.</p>
