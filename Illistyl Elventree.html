<p>Illistyl Elventree ( pronounced : /ˈ ɪ l ɪ s t ɪ l ˈ ɛ l v ɛ n t r i / IL-iss-til EL-ven-tree ) was a wizard and adventurer from Shadowdale in the Dalelands and a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Illistyl was born in Shadowdale around 1341 DR , the daughter of Ilcurt and Lasha Elventree . Ilcurt and his brother Neldock came to Shadowdale some time in the late 1330s DR , after leaving Elventree ; they would be known as 'recent arrivals' in Shadowdale for decades after.</p>
<p>Her parents died fighting with Zhent forces.</p>
<p>She first met the Knights of Myth Drannor while they were searching for a weretiger that had killed one of their members, the thief Alura Durshavin . They accidentally learned of Illistyl's psionic and magical talents and, with concerns for her welfare, protection, and development of her capabilities for the benefit of Shadowdale, as well as to control the danger her powers posed, they let her join them Doust Sulwood , at that time the Lord of Shadowdale, allowed Illistyl to live in the Twisted Tower of Ashaba . Although the Knights of Myth Drannor were based in Shadowdale at the time, only Illistyl was actually native to the dale. She soon proved herself capable in a fight.</p>
<p>Circa 1353 DR , the winter after the Knights rescued Dove from the Whistling Wizard inn in Voonlar , Elminster dispatched Jhessail, Illistl, and Sharantyr of Knights, as well as some two dozen Harper agents, to clear the place of the monsters that had since infiltrated it. With Storm and the Simbul and several Aglarondan apprentice mages doing the same, the Tarntar of Sembia happening to be present, and Elminster instigating matters, it became the massive, chaotic Battle at the Bar .</p>
<p>A census of Shadowdale conducted in the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR , recorded Illistyl Elventree and her magical and psionic aptitudes.</p>
<p>Illistyl was tutored in the magic arts by Jhessail Silvertree . When her teacher became pregnant with Merith Strongbow and later a mother, with the child born on Mirtul 1 , the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , Illistyl took a greater role amongst the Knights.</p>
<p>In 1357 DR, Illistyl and Lanseril Snowmantle of the Knights were venturing near Myth Drannor when they encountered Narm Tamaraith being harassed by bone devils . They saved the apprentice mage and saw him safely to Shadowdale where he could recover from his ordeal. Afterward, Illistyl and the other Knights would aid Shandril Shessair and Narm in Shadowdale.</p>
<p>Circa 1358 DR , Illistyl was known to wander the Dalelands. She was still only 17 winters old at the time. Nevertheless, she joined the Knights of Myth Drannor in the defense of Shadowdale against the forces of Zhentil Keep and Bane during the Time of Troubles that year.</p>
<p>Since then, Illistyl Elventree only grew more independent, more confident, and more powerful in magic. She became known as more than just Jhessail's apprentice and Torm's lover, but as a full-fledged member of the Knights of Myth Drannor as she continued to adventure amongst them.</p>
<p>True to their name, all the Knights of Myth Drannor came to Myth Drannor on Eleint 12 of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR to help defend the reclaimed city, joining the Elven Crusade and the Army of Myth Drannor against the Zhentarim and drow and the Masked Brigades . The Knights had sworn to defend Myth Drannor until the elves' return, and with the coming of the elves, the time had come to fulfill that vow. But in only hours, drow skirmishers drew them into a series of hit-and-run battles in the eastern forests. Their absence left Shadowdale fatally undefended against Sharran assassinations and a Zhentarim invasion of the dale. Nevertheless, they remained there as duty demanded as of Hammer 13 the following year , when they were joined by Mourngrym Amcathra , the former lord of Shadowdale, following the dale's liberation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As a young woman of 17 winters, Illistyl was small and lissome, standing only 5 feet and 1 inch (150 centimeters) in height and weighing 96 pounds (44 kilograms). Her blue eyes were described as friendly and bearing an impish twinkle, and her hair was dark and straight, and she kept it cut a little past her shoulders. She favored comfortable yet colorful attire, preferring a simple tunic and breeches to a lady's dress or a wizard's robes .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Illistyl Elventree was very independently minded and possessed a sharp tongue, a wry and mischievous humor, and an often cocky attitude. Age and experience only enhanced these qualities, making her also forceful and fearless. However, this belied her dependability, keen awareness, and sensitive nature. She was calm in battle. She was formerly something of a tomboy.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ilcurt and Lasha Elventree were her father and mother. She had a brother, Brennan , and a sister, Demeira . Her uncle, being her father's brother, was Neldock Elventree , and through him she had three cousins: Meltan , Neld , and Imura .</p>
<p>She was a lover of Torm , a rogue and fellow Knight; her independence and attitude made her well suited to putting up with him. Their relationship had surprising longevity for Torm, and she brought out his better nature.</p>
<p>Illistyl was both apprentice and good friend of fellow Knight Jhessail Silvertree . She spent more time caring for Jhessail's child, the infant Veluthil Silverbrow , than even her mother, given the crises requiring her. Nevertheless, Jhessail was training Illistyl to be her full replacement in the Knights of Myth Drannor.</p>
<p>She was a junior member of the Knights of Myth Drannor, standing alongside Torm, Rathan Thentraver , and Sharantyr .</p>
<p>Dove Falconhand of the Seven Sisters regularly recruited Illistyl to serve as a mage whilst hunting brigands around the Dalelands. Her son with Florin Falconhand of the Knights, Azalar Falconhand , enjoyed spending time with Illistyl when they visited Shadowdale. Storm Silverhand of the Seven Sisters dealt with Jhessail and Illistyl in her efforts to familiarize herself with both Shadowdale and the Knights.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Around 1358 DR, Illistyl provided arcane spellcasting for her fellow Knights of Myth Drannor and their tasks in the dales , but when the matter was too serious or too difficult, she would step back so Jhessail could bring her greater magic to bear. At such times, she acted as babysitter for the young one while the mother returned to the fight and also took care of the day-to-day magical needs of the Dalesfolk in place of the deceased Syluné . When needed, she would seek out Elminster for assistance.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>She had an aptitude for arcane magic and an innate talent for psionics . As a mage , she usually prepared the spells blue light , burning hands , firefinger , friends , mirror image , scare , unlock , untie from her traveling spellbook . However, she had another spellbook containing a total of 36 cantrips with a wide variety of applications. As a more experienced mage, she added dancing lights , enlarge , dispel magic , and lightning bolt to her repertoir.</p>
<p>In addition, Illistyl was a novice psionicist . She possessed the minor psionic devotions animal telepathy , body equilibrium , and empathy . She was capable of the psionic blast and ego whip attack modes and the mind blank and thought shield defense modes. She later developed another attack mode and another defense mode.</p>
<p>She was ambidextrous and proficient in daggers.</p>
<p>She also had some training in healing and the handling of horses .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Illistyl wore a brooch of shielding and slippers of spider climbing , was armed with two daggers , and had potion of clairvoyance and another of polymorph self . She was also often equipped with a a sizable pouch of herbs for medicine, a tinderbox and a dozen candles , and a small mirror in her backpack .</p>
