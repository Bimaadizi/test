<p>Tanataskar Moonwind was the cursed owner of the Cointoss tavern in Yartar around 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Once, Tanataksar was an adventurer devoted to Tempus but offended the god with his pride and Tempus cursed him. Whenever he drew blood in a fight, he went berserk, blinking and attacking random people, while broken weapons constantly fell out of his body, with no consequence for him. He consulted many wizards and priests of Tempus in order to find a cure but to no avail. He also stopped adventuring, in order to not risk endangering friends or fellow adventurers. He remained in his tavern and listened to stories of adventures. However, in his dreams, Tempus said to him that a great task awaited him.</p>
