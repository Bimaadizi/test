<p>An amber amulet of vermin was a magic item that conjured a giant insect to serve its owner.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The amulet consisted of an irregular nugget of natural amber on a gold chain, with an insect caught inside the amber. If watched closely, it appeared to slightly twitch.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>In the initial version of the amulet, when the amber was broken, the insect trapped inside burst out, sprang to life, and grew larger as though the spell giant vermin had been cast upon it. A later version could be reused once a day, with the insect being summoned and vanishing after one minute.</p>
<p>This creature could be either a giant bee , giant praying mantis , giant queen ant , giant stag beetle , giant wasp , huge monstrous centipede , large monstrous scorpion or large monstrous spider .</p>
<h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Depending on the type of creature, the amulet could be worth between 500 and 1200 gold pieces .</p>
