<p>The Chambeeleon ( pronounced : / k ɑː m ˈ b i l i ɒn / kam-BEE-lee-on ) was an old, ornate spell tome with an aquatic theme but unknown origin.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The resplendent cover of the spellbook was made of sheets of shimmering abalone and corners of pressed gold . It had 66 pages of polished electrum , with embossed writing that contained runes, glyphs, and script. Due to the distinctive elements in its crafting, it was completely waterproof.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The origins of the Chambeeleon were unknown, but it was markedly antique. The priesthoods of seven aquatic deities claimed it contained the "creation records" associated with their gods.</p>
<p>According to Alaer , it was found in the court of the aquatic elves at Thunderfoam an age before the Time of Troubles . Years later, the hero Galadaunt found the tome on the deck of a ghost ship in the Emerald Isles . He eventually sold it to an unnamed wizard whose apprentice wound up being known as the Mad Mage . This mage had the tome under guard by a succubus . His apprentice was Arbane , whose studies and recollection allowed for an understanding of the tome's contents.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The Chambeeleon was known to contain the following spells:</p>
<p>It was rumored to contain imprisonment and prismatic sphere as well. Also, as noted by Arbane, the version of conjure elemental would only summon water elementals ; they were loyal to the caster and would never attack them outright.</p>
