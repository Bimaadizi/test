<p>Echo gates , or ring-of-fire gates , were a magical practice devised by Ahghairon , the first Open Lord of Waterdeep , which employed the existing gates of Undermountain to bypass wards against teleport -type spells across Waterdeep .</p>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>An echo gate could be cast into areas that were otherwise warded in ways that could be reasonably expected to protect against the creation of gates or the use of teleportation spells.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Echo gates were first devised by Ahghairon, who found that leveraging the portals of Undermountain allowed for the creation of gates that bypassed most wards. He wrote a tome on the subject, which came to the possession of Amril Zoar . After mastering echo gates , Amril set out on his rampage killing of the Lords of Waterdeep in the early Flamerule of the Year of the Harp, 1355 DR . After he was captured, and his killing prevented by Storm Silverhand , Mirt reminded her to get the book from him anyway.</p>
