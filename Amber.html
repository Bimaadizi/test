<p>Amber was not a mineral, but this fossilized tree resin was graded as a fancy stone by civilized peoples, and beads of almost any quality were traded as currency among the northern barbarians .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amber was yellow to gold to orange in hue, and very soft and brittle. It was easily worked into strings of beads, but larger pieces were usually tumbled into smooth stones or polished and cut cabochon. Specimens that contained other fossils, like plants and insects, were priced four to five times higher than the base value. A typical clear specimen had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
