<p>Boots of elvenkind were magical boots, of elven origin that allowed the wearer to step across any surface quietly.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were rather soft for boots.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The boots of elvenkind allowed the wearer to walk much more quietly.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>They were popular amongst thieves because they were ideal for committing crimes. Thus elven makers were reluctant about letting them fall into foreign hands.</p>
<p>Several pairs of these boots were crafted for elven scouts in 884 DR , and aided in two major battles against mercenaries from Sembia .</p>
<h2>Varieties</h2>
<p>The slippers of soft movement from the lands of Zakhara had the same properties as boots of elvenkind , but appeared as slippers, and adjusted themselves to fit the feet of the respective wearer.</p>
