<p>Ondroth was a nascent kingdom of sea elves that inhabited the waters around the Tethyr Peninsula circa the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The elves of Ondroth occupied the caves on the underwater slopes off the coast of the Tethyr Peninsula, more commonly known as the Dragon's Head.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The peoples of Ondroth were self-exiled from the kingdom of Nindrol , located a bit over 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the north-northwest. As of 1370 DR, they had not chosen a ruler but had a few individuals from various families vying for the title as loyalties and popularity shifted fluidly. Why they broke away from Nindrol was not clear, and the population was so small that they did not control much territory at that time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The existance and brief history of Ondroth was revealed to the famed explorer Volothamp Geddarm by an elderly sea elf. Volo recorded the tale but did not independently verify the claims.</p>
