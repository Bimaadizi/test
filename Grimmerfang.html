<p>Grimmerfang was a male orc and Orc-King of the orcish kingdom of Vastar in the late 6th and early 7th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Vastar suffered eight bloody years of civil war following the death of Ologh the Overking , Grimmerfang won the war when he defeated his last rival for the throne, then ceremonially spitted, cooked and devoured them. Becoming Orc-King Grimmerfang in the Year of the Loose Coins, 580 DR , he took Ologh's court at the Hollow Mountain for himself, which he renamed "Mount Grimmerfang". With this, he ended warfare amongst the orcs of Vastar, at least for a short time.</p>
<p>However, taking advantage of the orcish strife, dwarves were encroaching from the west, spreading underground and applying increasing pressure on the orcs. Meanwhile, Vastar suffered repeated defeats to the elves . Finally, armed with orcslayer blades, the dwarves surged out of the mountains and slaughtered the orcs. Vastar fell in the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR , and Grimmerfang was slain in his namesake mountain. The orcish survivors were driven north and south into the mountain peaks as the dwarves founded Roldilar .</p>
