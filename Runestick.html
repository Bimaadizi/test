<p>A runestick was a magic wand made by a druid to store a certain number of spells for later use.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Runesticks were made of oak and measured around 12 inches (30 centimeters) in length. They had runes carved into their surfaces and were bound in mistletoe or holly .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>A runestick served as a repository for a limited number of druidic spells that could then be cast directly from the wand itself, similar in general principle to a ring of spell storing . It could store a maximum of five spell levels, and only druids of sufficient power could fashion such an item. After carving the runestick , the druid would then cast the desired spells directly into it to be stored. The wand could then be used by any druid when the proper word of command was spoken. The power of the magic contained in the runestick was equal to that of the druid who originally created it.</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>The lifespan of a runestick was limited. A month after it was created, the wand deteriorated to inert dust whether the spells stored in it were used or not, and it could not be recharged before that time. The only non-druids capable of using the wand were maidens of "pure heart" (provided they knew the command word), but in such cases the magic was only half as effective.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1358 DR , in the month of Uktar some time prior to the Feast of the Moon , the Volkumburgh shepherd Deker was clearing out the High Pasture in hopes of constructing a new barn. While doing so one of his sheep walked up to and bit a runestick that made it seemingly disappear. Later on a group of adventurers from Suzail , seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior Amanitas , came to enquire about this incident and found that the runestick acted as a two-way portal to another runestick near the ruins of the College of Rune Magics .</p>
