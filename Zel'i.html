<p>Zel’i was a githyanki child living and training in Crèche Y'llek in the Western Heartlands during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Zel'i was raised in the githyanki military culture at Crèche Y'llek, likely under the guidance of crèche caretakers and elder warriors devoted to Vlaakith . Despite her young age, she showed early aptitude with psionics and magic , namely the cantrip mage hand .</p>
<p>When the Absolute Adversaries arrived at the crèche, they would find Zel'i and her friend Ra'jak using their magic to toss around a locked traveler's chest . Unbeknownst to them—or possibly known and ignored—the chest contained a gremishka . The visitors might've either played along, interrupted them, or obtained the chest, possibly releasing the creature.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Zel'i's actions reflected the intensity of githyanki indoctrination, but her laughter and mischief revealed her youth. Zel'i was bold, curious, and enjoyed toying with outsiders. She referred to a stranger as an istik (a Gith insult for non-githyanki), but with a childish, mocking tone. Her sense of superiority was inherited from her people, but her behavior mimicked innocence more than cruelty.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Ra'jak was Zel'i's close companion and fellow githyanki trainee. They were nearly inseparable and always seen together.</p>
