<p>Grandmother Snow was the eldest bheur hag living in Shimmersky Valley as of the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Along with her fellow bheur hags, Grandmother Snow was able to command the howling winds of Shimmersky Valley, using them to carve snow drifts into battlement-like walls or labyrinthine traps. In combat, she attacked with icy blasts of magic .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Grandmother Snow and her fellow hags resisted the incursion by the Frosthunger Horde into Shimmersky Valley in the late 15 th century DR. However, they were largely unsuccessful in curbing the stubborn goblinoids as they stormed into the Valley from Dragonscar Gorge , fleeing from the depredations of their master, Shattercrown . The bheur hags became increasingly frustrated by this failure, so much so that they took out their anger on a party of adventurers from Waterdeep who had arrived to beat back the Horde. Grandmother Snow personally used her power over the winds to force the party to follow a trail created by her snow drifts, and lead them into a rocky dead end where she attacked them with a cackle.</p>
