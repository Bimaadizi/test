<p>Bellflowers were plants cultivated in elven communities. They were known for their scent and melodic sounds, but also served as a beautiful alarm system.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bellflowers chimed with a faint musical tinkling in the wind. They had different melodies according to the wind's direction and intensity.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Bellflowers could be found in Evermeet , especially in the gardens around Moonstone Palace , as well as in other elven settlements.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Bellflower gardens were designed to catch the slightest breeze, making the plants tinkle constantly. Any intruders passing through the area created a disruption in the air flow, thus altering the melody. The change could go unnoticed by the intruders, but be as alarming as a trumpet to the heightened senses of elven guards.</p>
