<p>Phaerorn was a cook at the Rain Bird Rooming House in Waterdeep in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Phaerorn took particular note that youngsters seemed less brave now than they'd once been.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He had long been a cook at the Rain Bird Rooming House for a long time. There, in addition to his normal tasks, he kept a door in the worst room of the kitchens clear of obstructions: that door had a carving of a hook-nosed wizard, and was covered in peeling blue paint.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was an old friend of Elminster Aumar , and had at least one son, who was working in Suzail . His least promising scullery boy was named Naviskurr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One night in early spring of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Phaerorn was cooking at the Rain Bird Rooming House and warning Naviskurr to ensure the door remained clear—he made this point vehemently, swinging a cleaver—when suddenly Elminster walked through that door. The wizard gave the cook news of his son. When Phaerorn explained to Naviskurr who the man was, the kid fainted.</p>
