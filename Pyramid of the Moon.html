<p>The Pyramid of the Moon was a mysterious structure in Chult . It only appeared during the full moon , and never in the same place twice. Once it appeared near Port Nyanzaru , and in the morning over two hundred people were missing; none were seen again.</p>
<p>It was said that the hallways within the pyramids were host to an eternal celebration, in which spirits and living beings danced, sang, and drank together. Those who did not leave before the moon set became spirits themselves, doomed to endlessly serve the Silver Priestess who sat on a glass throne in the pyramid's central chamber.</p>
