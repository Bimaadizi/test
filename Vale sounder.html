<p>Vale sounders were magical horns used to defend the Welcome Gates in the Visitors’ Vale on the island of Suj .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Vale sounders were iron horns 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length with a dual-tone output.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon activation, they emitted a shrill screech alongside a deep thrum, creating a cacophony of sound waves that clashed disharmoniously. This sonic assault radiated in a 120 feet (37 meters) cone. The sounder's low rumble caused the ground to shake intensely.</p>
<p>Creatures caught within the sonic cone lost concentration due to the horn's ear-piercing shriek and became deaf for several days. The silence spell mitigated these effects, although it did not prevent the ground quakes.</p>
