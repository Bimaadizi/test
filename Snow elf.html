<p>Snow elves were rare, reclusive elves who lived in icy, mountainous regions far from other civilization.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Snow elves were thin and slender like all elves, but were tough and wiry, as well as much taller: female snow elves were known to stand as much as 6 ft 4 in (1.9 m) tall, and males as much as 7 ft (2.1 m). They had pale skin, white or light blond hair that curled into wisps, and white or silver eyes.</p>
<p>They typically wore white clothing and favored bone jewelry.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Snow elves were typically described as being incredibly arrogant and equally unfriendly to any and all other races, save the valley elves that they sometimes befriended.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Snow elves were most closely related to valley elves .</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>Snow elves dwelt in icy cold mountains. They were native to the Crystalmist Mountains on Oerth , but there were unproven rumors snow elf clans also lived in far reaches of the Spine of the World or portions of the High Ice on Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>The chief deity of the snow elves was Tarsellis Meunniduin , though the worship of Rellavar Danuvien had also spread amongst them. Nonetheless, the snow elves explained some of the differences between them and other elves was due to them being directly descended from Tarsellis (a view most other elven scholars were skeptical about).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The tension between snow elves and other elves was said to date back to the wars that forced the drow into the Underdark : not knowing that the drow had turned to Lolth and declared war upon the rest of the elven people, the snow elves were deceived into allowing the drow passage, albeit for a large profit, through a mountain pass controlled by the snow elves. The other elves never formally condemned them for this, but tensions remained and snow elves withdrew into isolation*.</p>
<p>*Since then, the gap has between them and other elves has been attempted to be bridged to varying levels of success.</p>
