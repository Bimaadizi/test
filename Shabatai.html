After her companions offered aid to the warriors injured in the fight against Capnolithyl and thus ended the battle, he tried to orient them in their quest for the dracorage mythal , but knew of nothing that could aid them. It was another warrior amongst them that suggested they try asking The Hermit , which he initially dismissed.</p>
