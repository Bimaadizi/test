<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Embers, 1201 DR , an alliance of zulkirs Nymor Thrul, Narvonna Kren , and Szass Tam , devised a plan to invade the neighboring nation of Aglarond . Tam contributed his army of the undead to the cause and the trio formulated a complex strategy of a feint attack on the Watchwallm while Kren's warriors attacked Aglarond's flank through the Yuirwood . Nymor Thrul and Szass Tam felt nothing bust disdain for eachother but cooperated nevertheless. The attack was an initial successes thanks to Tam's undead, Kren's living troops, and Thrul's illusions concealing them. However, the humanoids lacked discipline and spent more time pillaging rather then following military orders, costing the zulkirs the element of surprise. The trip quickly fell to bickering, which cost them the operation. Nymor Thrul's reign as the Zulkir of Illusion came to an end right after the invasion failed. Being blamed for the narrow defeat, Szass Tam slew Nymor with the suffocate spell .</p>
