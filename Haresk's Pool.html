<p>Heresk's pool was a placid fishing pond nearby to the High Councilor's House in the city of Ashabenford within Mistledale . It was populated by a number of fish that would harmlessly nibble at the toes of anyone who decided to leap in for a swim.</p>
<p>During Haresk Malorn 's tenure as High Councilor , his wife Imbrautha and children could be found taking a swim in the pond to cool off during hot days.</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>There were legends that the muddy depths of the pond contained chests of gold coins and jewelry, the hidden cache of treasure from some long-past bandit captain. By the 1360s DR , the bottom of the pool had been dragged four times in search of these riches, but nothing was ever found.</p>
