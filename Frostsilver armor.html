<p>Frostsilver armor was distinctive enchanted dwarven armor produced in the hidden forges of Frostsilver Mines prior to that realm's eradication.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The armor had a reputation for being incredibly tough such that outfitting an army with it could turn the tide of a battle. Frostsilver armor remained in pristine condition even after centuries of disuse in the ruins of Frostsilver Mines, and it was said that each piece had received a blessing from Dumathoin that protected the secrets of its creation.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Suits of Forstsilver armor were known as the greatest treasures of Frostsilver. The dwarves used it to fashion animated armor defenders of their Mines, which they dubbed "Frostsilver Knights".</p>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the hobgoblin warlord Mrolgyet sent agents to tunnel into Frostsilver Mines with the objectives of bringing him back powerful artifacts. Before being stopped by adventurers from Waterdeep , they managed to retrieve a set of ornate Frostsilver armor and bring it to Mrolgyet. The hobgoblin fashioned the armor into a helmed horror , which he dubbed his "Champion" and which he would send out into battle in his stead.</p>
<p>The same adventurers who thwarted Mrolgyet's agents also defeated several Frostsilver Knights, and had to battle against the bandits of the Burntbone Horde who were trying to seize the magical armor. On the orders of Laeral Silverhand , the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the adventurers arranged to have pieces of the armor sent to Blackstaff Academy so that the students could study its secrets.</p>
<p>Those same adventurers would also eventually face Mrolgyet's Legion in battle at Chauntea's Citadel , and recognized the distinctive Frostsilver armor worn by Mrolgyet's Champion.</p>
