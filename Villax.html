<p>Villax was a powerful Amnian mercantile family during the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The house made history during the last days of the Torlath dynasty, when their archrivals, the Braethars , installed their respective puppet claimant. The Braethars had King Niskam the Doomed killed and replaced with King Rhor the Lackey in the Year of the Crested Thrush, 1094 DR , and the Villaxes responded in the Year of the Dawndance, 1095 DR , by slaying him and usurping the throne with King Dornak the Puppet King , who didn't last the year before being killed himself. The situation was ultimately resolved with King Erdhinn Wavegold I taking control of the realm.</p>
