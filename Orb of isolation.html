<p>The orb of isolation was a magical item used in the defense of Crosswinds Keep .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The orb was a glass sphere, glowing blue with magical power.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>With a command word, the orb of isolation hovered in place and sealed the area within 1 mile (1,600 meters) against planar travel, in a manner similar to dimensional lock . The warded area could be shaped so long as it remained within the distance limit. The orb's power prevented the ingress of any creature into the warded area, acting as an invisible and impenetrable barrier. Up to three gaps could be created at the user's option on the barrier: these gaps could be any size from 5 feet (1.5 meters) to 200 feet (61 meters).</p>
<p>Portals within the warded area had an even stranger effect; they malfunctioned most of the time, and had a further effect on outsiders , who became unable to wander further than 300 feet (91 meters) from a portal through which they had entered the warded area. This effect could be ended for any given outsider with a limited wish , miracle , break enchantment or remove curse powerful enough to cancel the orb's magic, or it could be broken for all of them by shutting down the orb.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The orb of isolation was part of the defenses of Crosswinds Keep as of 1372 DR .</p>
