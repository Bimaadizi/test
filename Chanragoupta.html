<p>Chanragoupta was a Netherese arcanist and merchant who operated Chanragoupta's Exotic in Eileanar until its destruction in 3520 NY (−339 DR) .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Chanragoupta traveled Faerûn in search of exotic textiles for his shop. He also bought up any fabrics brought back by the spelljammers of Yeoman's Loft , making him the sole supplier of these rare fabrics from Realmspace and other planes . His skills in business caused him to come into competition with Karmandon's Finery , resulting in Karmandon circulating the most horrid rumors in order to sabotage him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Chanragoupta managed to catch the prolific thief Cadogen during an attempted robbery, and intended to have him hanged at dawn the next day. Cadogen used his roguish skills to not only slip his bonds, but seduced Chanragoupta's wife Valleria , and escaped with her. With the situation posed as a kidnapping for ransom, Chanragoupta paid the demanded 20,000 gp , though she never returned. Despite fearing that she had been killed, he maintained a standing 5,000 gp reward for her safe return afterwards.</p>
