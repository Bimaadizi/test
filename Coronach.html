<p>A coronach was a bard lich , undead creatures who had once been magical performers who used a magic ritual to seal their soul in their instrument and grant them eternal life.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As an undead creature, coronachs did not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe air . They were also resistant to turn undead and similar effects. When a coronach's body was destroyed, the spirit that animated it returned to their instrument. The instrument then faded away, only to reappear with the coronach again fully formed at the place where the coronach had first played a song as a living creature.</p>
<p>Coronachs were powerful spellcasters. They had access to the following spells: friends , prestidigitation , thunderclap , dissonant whispers , Tasha's hideous laughter , shield , see invisibility , silence , fear , hypnotic pattern , greater invisibility , dominate person , synaptic static , Otto's irresistible dance , forcecage , and power word, kill . They could play an overpowering dirge that would drain the life force from those nearby into the coronach. They could also use their signature instrument as a magical weapon, slamming it into foes to paralyze them.</p>
<p>Coronachs were also gifted with quick wits. They could use cutting words at carefully chosen moments to unbalance others. They also had the power to dramatically reveal an intimate secret of a creature within 10 feet (3 meters) of them, which could magically charm that target.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>The ritual to become a coronach involved the bard ceaselessly playing the first song they ever learned for a tenday . After this, the bard's heart would die and their soul would be stored in their instrument. Typically, to keep them nourished through the ritual, bards employed others to feed them and take care of their bodies. Once the ritual was complete, the new coronach would kill these assistants to keep their secret safe. This first song the bard ever learned was also the secret to destroying a coronach. If the coronach's instrument was ever used to play that song, both it and the bard would be destroyed in a deafening explosion. To protect themselves, coronachs kept the truth of their creations private.</p>
<p>Coronachs moved through the world, ceaselessly learning new stories and songs. Without this, their bodies would wither and disintegrate. Their appetite for long-forgotten tales and tunes could never be filled.</p>
<h2>Notable Coronachs</h2>
