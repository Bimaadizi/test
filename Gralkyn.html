<p>During the Brave Blades' delve into Ondil's Tower , Gralkyn was instrumental in defeating a large trap where sparks of light followed metal objects. Later, during a battle against a trap that held a red dragon , beholder , and a mind flayer in abeyance, Gralkyn helped fling projectiles into the beholder. He also helped explore the area beyond the trap, a circular room with no end of balconies on its sides, though he realized soon that all of the balconies, including the one they came from, led into the same room.</p>
<p>After they made their way into the lich's chamber, Gralkyn smashed one of the windows; in response, a force squeezed him out of it, and hurled him into the ground, where he died.</p>
