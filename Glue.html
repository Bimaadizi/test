Fish bones, fish scales, animal hides, animal bones, horns, hooves, and deer antlers were all boiled to obtain the substance, with the hooves of oxen , horses , and mules commonly used. A variant called oyster glue was derived from certain Inner Sea shellfish, and produced an innocuous substance that only activated on contact with moisture.</p>
