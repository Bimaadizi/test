<p>The touched were mages that Mystra commissioned for a task, offering a small amount of power in exchange.</p>
<h2>Commission</h2>
<p>When Mystra liked a mage's character, she sometimes appeared to them in private as a blue radiance and offered them power in exchange for a service.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>The tasks of the Touched could be small indeed, such as casting spells of wild magic into a dead magic zone, or they could be more major, such as destroying an enchanted object at a particular, dangerous location. Even political tasks could be asked of one so touched.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The touched were never quite sure what their powers were, and sometimes learned those only in the moment, as a surprise realization that something they thought impossible became possible.</p>
<h2>Completion</h2>
<p>After completion, though the powers vanished, they usually kept some minor magic, such as a light or feather fall spell useable at will, or a strong resistance to one school of magic. Those who missed the power overmuch could petition to become a Pursuivant Arcane , or even a weavespinner .</p>
