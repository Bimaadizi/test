<p>A hooded lantern was the basic type of lantern; an illumination device that protected the source of light behind glass within a frame of metal.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Typical hooded lanterns consisted of a metallic frame enclosing glass panels, within which a wick connected to a reservoir of oil burned and shed light out to a range of 60 feet (18 meters), as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for 1 pint (470 milliliters) of oil.</p>
<p>Some hooded lanterns allowed the hood to be lowered, significantly decreasing the amount of light shed by the lantern without the need to extinguish the flame.</p>
