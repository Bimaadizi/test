In 1373Â DR , the spy Gorstag Helder stole an emerald pendant from him on the night of Hammer 16 for the Cult of the Dragon , under the orders of the local Wearer of Purple, Cylla Morieth . After he found the emerald in a strongbox, Hezza surprised him; though the thief claimed to work on behalf of the Harpers , Hezza was indifferent. Gorstag knocked him out during their fight and then ran away.</p>
