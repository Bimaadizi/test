<p>Firethorn , or Sea Rose , was a naturally occurring plant on the Island of Firethorns within the Genie's Turban off the coast of mainland Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The presence of firethorn gave the Island of the Firethorns a lovely red coloration. Though beautiful, the firethorn plant's thorns carried a dangerous poison , creating a natural barrier that surrounded most of the lower portions of the island since the plants grew so close together. Firethorn plants also gave off natural heat and glowed softly.</p>
