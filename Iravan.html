<p>Iravan was one of the most wealthy and influential merchant houses of Cormyr , as of the 14 th century DR , that formed the nation's economic backbone.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Along with their competitor merchant houses, the Iravan family's holdings were found throughout Cormyr and stretched into neighboring regions. The merchant houses aided the Dragon Throne in tax collection and were the power behind Cormyrean nobility.</p>
<p>In Suzail , the capital of Cormyr, the Iravan family ran a sizable rental yard, neighboring the rental yards of the Talahon merchant family to the north. The Iravan rental yards stood by Suzail's western wall, just north of the Field-Gates .</p>
