<p>Hruggek ( pronounced : /ˈ h r ʌ g ɛ k / HRUG-ek ) was the chief deity of bugbears , and was the god of ambush, violence, and combat. At one time he was an exarch of the greater god Bane . Other gods worshiped by the bugbears included Grankhul , the god of hunting, senses, and surprise; and Skiggaret , the god of fear.</p>
<p>Prior to relocating to Banehold , Hruggek lived in a large cave in Pandemonium called Hruggekolohk . His home was adorned with the severed heads of his defeated opponents.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Hruggek appeared as a massive, powerful bugbear, 12 ft (3.7 m) tall. He had great fangs and clawed hands and feet, and wielded a 10-foot long morningstar .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<h3>Clergy and temples</h3>
<p>Hruggek's priests dressed in black and wore skulls on their heads. [ citation needed ] Bugbears sacrificed the blood of their enemies to Hruggek.</p>
<p>Shamans of Hruggek could achieve the ability to cast up to 5th level divine spells.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hruggek was mostly apathetic to other deities, including those within the Goblinoid Pantheon . The only god he appeared to care about in any capacity was the goblin god Khurgorbaeyag , who he had an alliance with. Hruggek would occasionally compliment Khurgorbaeyag's plans and compare them to Maglubiyet's (which he claimed were inferior to the Overseer of All's) in order to sow discord within the Goblinoid Pantheon to secure more resources for his bugbears.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to his assimilation into the Goblinoid Pantheon, Hruggek was the unofficial leader of the Bugbear Pantheon . This pantheon was comprised of himself, Grankhul, Skiggaret, and three other unnamed deities that were presumably slain by Maglubiyet.</p>
