The other three were Welkinglory , Stockhold , and Vaseid . All four were depicted on a circular stained glass mosaic in an upper central chamber of the monastery. Around the mosaic were four pedestals, upon which laid each of their ceremonial weapons – masterfully crafted enchanted +1 items that were among those great works that attracted pilgrims from across Faerûn , Lathanderian and members of other faiths alike.
