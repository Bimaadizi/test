<p>The Trollford was a passable ford on the Amstel River by the South Road in Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Trollford was the only safe, shallow ford on the Amstel River for many miles, as the river was too swift and deep for much of its length.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The ford was located south of Eshpurta along the Troll Road (the local stretch of the South Road) as it crossed the Amstel, 40 miles (64 kilometers) downriver and 75 miles (120 kilometers) upriver of the next viable crossings. It was just downriver of the Qadim Hills and the junction of the River Valashar and Khalleshyr .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The site was once the center of a troll civilization that was wiped out by humans from Calimshan during its Third Age ( −1900 DR to −900 DR ), a period of northern expansion. The few surviving trolls fled to the nearby mountains, granting the name of the Troll Mountains , and a small population continued to persist in the region. The fallen kingdom's vast wealth was never found, and treasure hunters repeatedly searched the area to no result. The region became known as the Ralamnish Ridings , imperial Calimshan's northern frontier.</p>
<p>Trolls continued to use the ford to cross the river, and opportunistically raided caravans on the road. Council Army troops in Eshpurta received special training on dealing with trolls, and provided paid escorts from the city to past the ford. During the 14 th century DR , the troll population increased notably and so did their raids and skirmishes. It was believed that between the troll's original royal stash and the treasure obtained from looting, they had amassed a truly massive hoard.</p>
