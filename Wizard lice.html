<p>Wizard lice were a species of magical louse , tiny parasitic insects found in the land of Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A wizard louse usually measured 1 ⁄ 16 th of an inch in length, making them very difficult to spot.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Though generally harmless in small numbers, wizard lice bred rapidly, forming a nest on each host they infested. They fed off of memories and magical energy. They were particularly harmful when attached to wizards or priests , capable of erasing one spell per day from their host's memory.</p>
<p>A host infected with wizard lice needed to bathe with strong soaps or cleaning agents to effectively kill them. The cure disease spell was also a reliable method used to destroy wizard lice.</p>
