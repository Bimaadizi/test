<p>Ardreyth Mizzrym was a drow woman and a former matron mother of House Mizzrym in Menzoberranzan .</p>
<p>One day during a hunt, she happened to swat a wingless wonder out of her way when it suddenly snarled and created a meteor swarm , obliterating her and most of her family in the area. As the dust cleared, the merely blackened wonder sighed and waddled away, as the remaining drow looked on in shock, none daring to stop it. It was thought to still be active by the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
