<p>Dunsel was a dwarf with a dream during the early years of Khôltar , the Iron City. In the Year of the Molten Anvils, 366 DR , he finally got the funds from his Shieldlord and friend, Amberu Khôltar , to build a road paved in stone from Eartheart to Khôltar. It took years, and skeptical residents of the Iron City referred to the project as "Dunsel's Dream", but when it was finally completed, dozens of new heavy wagons (invented in the Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR , by Ulbrask Hael ) took advantage of the Dunsel Trail and brought a surge of prosperity to the town as it became a busy trade center. Dunsel didn't stop there: in the years to follow, he continued on, extending his road hundreds of miles across the Shaar to meet the Golden Road at Shaarmid , which benefited in a similar way.</p>
