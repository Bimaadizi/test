<p>High Lord Erlan Duirsar , also called Lord Duirsar and "Watcher Over the Hills", was the leader of the Hill Elders , the rulers of Evereska .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was short and thin with silver hair and a face that showed signs of age.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>High Lord Duirsar was a trusted, capable and decisive commander and leader for more than two centuries.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>He once created his own mist golem , a magical construct that resembled a being of "hard air", similar to that of a wall of force .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though he longed to protect Evereska from the outside world, since the phaerimm siege, High Lord Duirsar worked to move toward a more open relationship with the city's neighbors. He understood the true potential of the Netherese threat, respected the efforts to rebuild Myth Drannor, and embraced the end of the Retreat.</p>
<p>Duirsar also commanded the Cold Hand —an elite military company composed of Evereska's finest warriors that protected the city for over a century. At times, Duirsar's stewardship over the Evereskan military conflicted with his duties as head councilor of the Hill Elders, specifically when the council attempted to influence decisions made on behalf the realm's safety.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was aided by his trusted messenger, a finch named Manynests that fluttered around Evereska speaking with elves at his behest.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Lord Duirsar directed Evereska's high mages to the ancestral crypts of House Vyshaan in the Greycloak Hills , under escort by Kiinyon Colbathin the Evereskan Tomb Guard , in order to repair the tear in the Sharn Wall deep underground. The expedition suffered heavy casualties and were unsuccessful in their efforts. As the phaerimm escaped from the Sharn Wall and began to wreak havoc along the outer reaches of the Evereska Vale , Duirsar coordinated the realm's defense, again entrusting in the command of Tomb Master Colbathin despite his previous failures.</p>
<p>Months into the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Evereska had fallen under siege by the phaerimm entirely. In Mirtul of that year, Lord Duirsar worked with the archmage of Waterdeep —and stalwart ally of Evereska— Khelben Arunsun to strategize how the city could hold out through the siege of the phaerimm. When Evereska's mythal was on the verge of failing, Duirsar gave the final command that Khelben and the Company of the Cold Hand should leave the protection of the city's magical barrier and fight the phaerimm to ensure they did not overwhelm the city.</p>
