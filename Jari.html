<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , Jari sought to impress his beloved Anja 's father. The beautiful woman had numerous suitors, and her father thought that the men needed to compete for Anja's hand. Jari thought that if he failed to impress his beloved's parent, the couple would have to run away from the Wandering Village together, which was a likely outcome of the competition. Jari was not a good hunter, and in desperation, he thought of entering the deadly Fell Wood to try and kill one of the great white winter wolves tho laired there.</p>
