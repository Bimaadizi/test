<p>Giant-kin were large humanoids related to the true giants . Any race that could trace its lineage back to Othea 's relationship with Ulutiu could be considered giant-kin. The mother of all giants, Othea, cheated on her husband Annam All-Father , the father of giants, with Ulutiu, producing the firbolgs , fomorians , verbeegs , and the voadkyn . All true giants considered these types of giant-kin maug because of this act of unfaithfulness.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite the usual reluctance of giant-kin to interact with other giant-kin species, the coming of the Twilight Spirit increased the activity of true giant tribes in the Ice Spires , leading to concerns among giant-kin for their own protection, and some resulting cooperation between the species.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>A typical giant-kin pregnancy was nine months, and the offspring took around eighteen years to reach maturity.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Giant-kin did not generally associate with different types of giant-kin. Within their own tribes, they were bound by the ordning (except firbolgs ), and when they did interact with other giant species, they were ranked below all others, except ogres . Most giant-kin were under the impression that one day, they would be accepted back into "true giant" society and be accepted by their half-brothers.</p>
<h2>Main types of giant-kin</h2>
<h2>Other types</h2>
<p>The ogres were created during Othea's affair with Vaprak , and as a result were despised as giant-kin by true giants. Cyclopes and cyclopskin were of unknown descent but were believed to be the product of another of Othea's affairs.</p>
