<p>The Wild Hills was a barren plot of land that stretched between the Lizard Marsh and the hamlet of Gillian's Hill .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The region was known for its dead trees and a deep craggy river. It rushed through the Hills and joined Delimbiyr River , close to the mouth of the river, merging into the Sea of Swords . The Wild Hills had several shallow caves and an old toll house that sat atop the natural bridge that connected the two sides of the deep ravine through which a river flowed.</p>
<p>The Wild Hills were eight hours of a trek by foot away from the city of Daggerford .</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>This patch of land was mostly inhabited by carrion crows and vicious worgs . Sporadic barren trees wild grasses covered the craggy earth.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1372 DR , a group of dark Malarite druids made a lair in the Wild Hills. They actively sought to destroy the Stone Circle of Govan of the Brush of Barbs . The dark druids built a spine underneath the Tree of Blood, with the entrance hidden from casual eyes. The hidden Malarite lair was a humble circular room with several pieces of furniture and three deep, dark, foul-smelling oubliettes. The dark druids could be easily recognized by their pitch-black robes splattered with the blood from their sacrifices' blood. The Malarite worshipers were also allied with the local words who happily served the Lord of the Hunt.</p>
<p>During the same period of time, a group of gnolls under the leadership of a shaman Rattlefang were warring with the group of ogres , led by Guruk Bonesnap , who took over the old toll house. At some point shortly before 1372 DR, Guruk crushed the skull of the ogres' previous leader - Kolgok Skullcrush . Both ogres and gnolls wanted to hold the bridge to collect tolls from travelers, and both factions sought the aid of the Hero of Daggerford . It was unknown which of the two groups eventually emerged victorious.</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>At some point, long before 1372 DR, a large stone structure was located at the eastern side of the crag, but by the late 14 th century DR , nothing was left of the building apart from low crumbled walls. Rattlefang's gnolls considered the tumbling structure to be their "stronghold".</p>
