<p>Sleeping Hollow was an Arn settlement on the Arnrock volcano in the Lake of Steam through the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The settlement was the closest thing to a town on the island, although it was more appropriate to call it a ramshackle collection of small homes and boarding houses.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sleeping Hollow was obliterated when the Arnrock erupted in the Year of the Halflings' Lament, 1386 DR .</p>
<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<p>The "town" was home to the Brazen Buck , which was not just the only inn and the only tavern, but also the only establishment that catered to non-halflings on the island.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Sleeping Hollow—and indeed the whole Arnrock—was home to the Arn, a population of interrelated strongheart halfling farmers, fishers, and coppersmiths . The island's only permanent non-halfling resident was Belathra Kyndle , the proprietor of the Brazen Buck.</p>
