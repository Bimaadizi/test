<p>The Lorious Inn , most often called just the Lorious , was an upscale inn in Veltalar as of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The Lorious Inn was in Veltalar .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The front door was wide.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The Lorious' entrance hall was packed with tables draped with red fabric. The saloon past the entrance hall had a bit of haze due to the burning incenses and pipes within the room. Within the Lorious, there were only magical lights.</p>
<p>The hallways leading to the rooms had golden lamps, and tapestries. There were plaques announcing the latter were looted from the ruins of Mulhorand .</p>
<p>The lead-lined vaults had marble interiors.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Lorious was counted among the city's finer establishments; a day's stay cost five gold pieces at its rooms with adjoining lead-lined vaults, more than twice what other upscale suites cost.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>For those in dire need of privacy, and due to the volume of money that changed hands inside, the Lorious offered suites with lead-lined vaults.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1396Â DR , Japheth Donard rented a room at the Lorious Inn, where he kept the body of Anusha Marhana as he arranged to return her wandering soul to her. He fled a few tendays later, when Raidon Kane , Seren Juramot and Aulruick Thoster came after him. The three of them discussed their next move at the casino saloon afterwards.</p>
