<p>Freygar Plumbline was a dwarven member of Hal Stoutheart 's Tethyamar expedition during the 1480s DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Freygar had a thick black beard and head of hair.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In his aunt Asta's opinion, Freygar had an inflated opinion of himself. Despite that, she cared deeply about him and followed him to the Tethyamar Mining Outpost where he worked as a surveyor, in order to make sure he was safe.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Freygar was a surveyor in the expedition, charting the tunnels and the resources within. With the growing fervor around the jewels of ardor , Freygar set about trying to find the Tethyamar Master Manifest , a compilation of maps and ancient mining records that would greatly aid their efforts. Using some surfacer mercenaries, he sent a team down to Ironvale Deep , Tethyamar's library complex. Fighting through monsters and the drow of House Argith , they overcame the leader Kir'tan Melarn and recovered the Manifest . Despite getting what he wanted, Freygar was confused and disappointed that while the records mentioned the jewels of ardor, they were described as low-value crystals not worth mining. He ultimately decided that the Manifest was a fake copy, and the real one was still hidden somewhere in the ruins.</p>
