<p>Fleshrender , once known as Barney , was an enchanted short sword that could temporarily negate the target's healing.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Fleshrender possessed a strong +2 enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward the target and exacerbated the blade's damage. The weapon's second magic was an enchantment that parted the flesh . It gave the weapon diabolical precision and had a chance of stopping the target from healing or regenerating .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fleshrender's original owner called the short sword Barney , but such an innocent name led to ridicule. Eventually, the owner gave in and renamed Fleshrender under the pressure of mockery, but sulked for a tenday after. Eventually, the weapon ended up in the hands of the Echo of Abazigal , an apparition of a long-dead Bhaalspawn who served Sarevok Anchev in his Murder Tribunal in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR .</p>
