<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Lorna Esthelian was one of the targets for the vampire spawns under the control of Cazador Szarr , a powerful vampire from the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. She was seduced by one of the spawns and invited to attend an exclusive party at "the Palace" just the night before during a diner date at the Blushing Maiden Inn . Lorna found it a bit suspicious her date ate nothing during dinner and brought in his own " wine ," thick and metallic-smelling. She was to meet her consort in the sewers of Baldur's Gate near a secret door that opened into the Szarr Palace's undercellars. Luckily, the spawn never showed up, leaving Lorna unable to attend the party. All of the party's guests were brutally torn to shreds by Cazador Szarr's beast and werewolf thralls.</p>
