<p>The Founder , also known as the Red Woman , was a Red Wizard of Thay in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She was the lover of the Chosen of Myrkul , Akachi . However, she was Faithless and one day she died as a result of an accidental spell backfire and was condemned to the Wall of the Faithless . Akachi was distraught over her fate and went so far as to turn against his faith and god and led a crusade to save her. In the end, Akachi was captured and punished by Myrkul but not before he saved the Founder from the Wall.</p>
<p>Thus, it was now the Founder who needed a plan to save her lover from the wrath of Myrkul. She founded the Academy of Shapers and Binders in Thaymount , hence her title. The Founder created Nefris , Lienna , and Safiya from fragments of her own soul in order to attract the Kalach-Cha to Rashemen in order to save Akachi. However, she also permitted Akachi's brother Araman to enter the academy, unaware that he was under a geas by Myrkul to destroy her.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Araman led a coup in the academy and captured the Founder but, before he could kill her, the Kalach-Cha arrived and saved her. The Founder admitted to being guilty of all the crimes she had committed against the Kalach-Cha and presented him with a fully restored Silver Sword of Gith , stating that the only way the Kalach-Cha could restore themself, and Akachi, was to enter the Betrayer's Gate and launch a third crusade to assault the Wall of the Faithless. The Kalach-Cha could have chosen to spare the Founder's life or kill her.</p>
