<p>Andranth Glarvreth was a very successful merchant in Cormyr during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Glarvreth wanted by all means to become a noble, resenting actual nobles for his failure so far.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Glavreth and Relgadrar Loroun had an icy relationship after the earlier refused to meet with the latter, twice. He had joined a faction of Sembia -backed conspirers looking to seize power; a rival conspiracy was headed by Kormoroth of Westgate , whom he knew personally. He employed a number of bodyguards and warriors.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Andranth was an importer, supplying other sellers with ironmongery and glasspane products. He also conspired to be ennobled.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His manor had a stone lion's head atop the gate, and was several stories tall. The feasting hall was high-beamed, with a wall covered in magnificent reliefs of hunting figures, while the opposite had monumentally high windows.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Andranth Glarvreth was born in Suzail . By 1479Â DR , he hadn't yet become a nobleman; this rankled him enough that he'd so far rebuffed two invites by Relgadrar Loroun to become friends and make common cause against the Crown. He had since hatched a plan, aided by some Sembian-aligned cabal, in which he'd assembled first an armory in the middle of Suzail, to better seize power should civil war erupt.</p>
<p>In the day originally scheduled for the Council of the Dragon , Andranth invited Relgadrar Loroun, a noble he regarded before as a rival, to dinner, almost certainly seeking his support. Mind-controlled by the vampire archmage Manshoon , Relgadrar's bodyguard, Burrath , then told them that some men had followed Relgadrar along the way, to which Andranth sent out several of his bullyblades into the street to hunt those down.</p>
<p>However, before dinner could start, assassins led by Kormoroth of Westgate burst in through the windows and Andranth Glarvreth fled through a secret tunnel. Burrath, after avenging his Lord, followed Andranth; asking who was the killer, Andranth explained Kormoroth had been the one Andranth slew. He then dropped a portcullis on the secret tunnel, and fled alone, leaving Burrath to find a different way out.</p>
