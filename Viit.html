<p>A viit was a temporary structure used by iskotuk .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The viit was a makeshift shelter used in emergencies or when the regular rissik was insufficient.</p>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>To construct a viit, two flexible branches, each approximately 6​ to ​8 inches (0.15​ to ​0.2 meters) long were required. One end of the first branch was secured in the ground, forming an arc shape, and then the second branch was secured perpendicularly to the first, creating a dome-like frame. A long cord was wrapped around the bottom of the frame to prevent the branches from snapping back. The frame was then covered with available skins and blankets. A layer of snow, a few inches thick, was piled around and on top of the frame. An open space was left for entry and ventilation.</p>
