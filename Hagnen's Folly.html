<h2>History</h2>
<p>The crossbow that would later receive the name of its creator was never finished by Hagnen Odestone , a dwarven designer of some renown. It was among many other weapons left unfinished when the dwarf was killed in the great earthquake of the Year of the Blade, 1275 DR . His wife, Miraenna Odestone‎ , begrudgingly finished her late husband's designs. One crossbow she finished by stringing it with a dragon's gut and making it Hagnen's Folly . Miraenna took the Folly and other finished works when she left her clan and headed south to sell off her husband's work. Since then, Hagnen's Folly changed several owners until it ended up in the hands of Ilium Ar'Ghrenoir , a druid defender inhabiting a secluded frozen settlement of Andora in Icewind Dale in the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR .</p>
