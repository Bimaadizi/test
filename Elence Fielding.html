<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the village of Imnesvale faced a slew of disappearances, and locals did not hesitate to blame the legendary Umar Witch . Elence sold her goods, including mundane armor , weapons , some jewelry, and an occasional potion of fire resistance . However, her business suffered from strife, and the supplier mercantile company hadn't been bringing goods in. Unlike the villagers who blamed the Umar Witch and some fellow merchants who blamed nearby ogres , Elence believed that the reason behind disappearance was simple â€“ wolves .</p>
