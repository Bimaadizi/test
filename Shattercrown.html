<p>Shattercrown was a frost giant who commanded the Frosthunger Horde in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<p>He aspired to restore and rule the ancient stronghold of Thrymstone despite the risk of sparking a war between giants and dragons that would threaten all of Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was calm, confident, cruel, and driven, but it was his incredible strength that most characterized him and gained him the loyalty of his subordinates. Following even a heated battle, he would simply dust himself off and return to whatever task was at hand.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Shattercrown fought with his fists, and would make a show of discarding his axe before a battle. He would pummel his foes and the battlefield alike to the roaring delight of his frost giant followers. He was remarkably resilient and very quick, seemingly with Thrym 's own reflexes. He specialized in disrupting his enemies' tactics and stunning them with his strikes.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was sworn enemies with the white dragons of the Frozenfar , notably Kovanyrach .</p>
<p>Most of his subordinates served him either out of fear or—in the case of his lieutenant Horrengar and the winter wolves of the Wintergnaw pack —respect for his incredible strength.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Shattercrown claimed to be the same frost giant who originally constructed Thrymstone in ancient times after wresting the building stones from the god Thrym.</p>
<p>Shattercrown arrived in Dragonscar Gorge to excavate the ruins of Thrymstone in the late 15 th century DR, and he and his subordinates immediately subjugated the Frosthunger Horde to force them into hard labor to achieve this. He personally brought the Wintergnaw pack of winter wolves under his control by cowing them with his strength.</p>
<p>Over several years, his efforts eventually unearthed Thrymstone and allowed him to access the main gates, but at this time the excavation came under attack by both the white dragons of Kovanyrach —angered by the efforts to restore the ancient fortress which their ancestors had destroyed—and adventurers from Waterdeep sent by Open Lord Laeral Silverhand —drawn to the conflict after goblinoids fleeing from Shattercrown's rule had attacked Shimmersky Valley .</p>
<p>The adventurers managed to invade Thrymstone, defeat Horrengar, and confront Shattercrown. Despite his bravado and great strength, Shattercrown was defeated. With his strength having been broken, the Frosthunger Horde scattered and the frost giants fled, many of them being killed by Kovanyrach's dragons. Despite his defeat, Shattercrown refused to relinquish his mission of restoring Thrymstone.</p>
