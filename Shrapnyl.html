<p>Shrapnyls were a powerful variation of raggamoffyn made from shards of metal of all types. Entire metal objects including horseshoes , weapons, shields , etc. could also help compose a shrapnyl.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When controlling a host a shrapnyl arranged itself so it resembled a suit of splint mail . In fact, a shrapnyl would actually protect their host as if the host was wearing a suit of armor.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>All raggamoffyns attempted to envelop potential victims in order to control them. If successful, the parts of the raggamoffyn clung to the victim in a skin-tight sheath from head to toe. The raggamoffyn usually created a hood to cover the victim's face as well. Once enveloped, a victim was forced to do the raggamoffyn's bidding until the creature was done with them or they were able to resist the creature's control.</p>
<p>Shrapnyls prefered to control larger creatures such as ogres . Attacking a shrapynl with acid would result in that part of the shrapnyl flipping over, so the acid also struck that region of the host.</p>
<p>A shrapnyl could create a violent explosion of metal shards that would harm anything within 10 feet (3 meters). Performing this explosive attack was taxing for the shrapynl, resulting in their host being able to shake their control. The shrapnyl would need to retreat and rest before attempting to control a new host. Because of this most shrapnyls only used this attack when desperate.</p>
<p>Shrapynls were vulnerable to the shatter , crystalbrittle , and heat metal spells .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around the 1370's DR , one was likely to encounter a shrapnyl while traversing the wilds of the Upperdark .</p>
