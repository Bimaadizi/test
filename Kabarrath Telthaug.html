<p>Imperceptor Kabarrath Telthaug was the high priest and self-stylized Dread Imperceptor of Bane in the Black Lord's Cloak temple in Mourktar before the Time of Troubles and the ruler of the city until 1365 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>With over 700 other Banite priests, over 1,000 other followers, and his own personal army of soldiers, Kabarrath asserted himself above the rest of the Banite hierarchy. Kabarrath was eager to grow his influence even further in Unther with the destruction of the Untheric pantheon. With the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Kabarrath's increasingly mad behavior led many to believe he was claimed by Cyric .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR , the king of Mourktaur, Theris , announced to his subjects that he would soon be dying. As he had no heir to whom he could bequeath his kingdom, Theris called for a grand tournament of athletic prowess at the Fields of Pryollus at the base of Mount Thulbane , to determine who was worthy of Mourktar's crown. While the soldier of Akanax Helyos came close to victory, no clear victor arose as the winner.</p>
<p>In truth, Kabbarath Telthaug had sabotaged the tournament and managed to install himself as the Regent of Mourktar until the Year of the Sword, 1365 DR , when rule of the city was forcibly shared with three younger blue dragons , by decree of the dracolich Alasklerbanbastos , ruler of Threskel. The Great Bone Wyrm sought to consolidate power in the absence of Tchazzar , who perished during the Time of Troubles. Regent Kabbarath ignored the will of the dragon-king until Mourktar was devastated by the vampiric dragon Jaxanaedegor ands several "lesser" dracoliches . The leaders of Mourktar responded with continued offerings and oblations as acts of acquiescence.</p>
