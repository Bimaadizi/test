<p>Kesefehon was an elf commander of the Myth Drannor 's defense forces that died of a mysterious disease before the Weeping War . The sickness that took his life brought him back as a mummy that was still inside his crypt in 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his prime, Kesefehon was a beautiful elf with blond hair who often wore his decorative elven breastplate adorned with a wolf insignia.</p>
<p>In death, Kesefehon laid in his sarcophagus covered with a delicate silk sheet. Under the covering, his dried skin was still encrusted with growths and dried up sores.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In life, Kesefehon was a brave and honorable commander of Myth Drannor's military forces. After he contracted the strange disease that was his downfall, his personality changed drastically, making him violent and quite mad.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Even though Kesefehon was missing linen wrappings and did not appear as a regular mummy, he did possess all of their regular abilities.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kesefehon was entombed in his crypt in Polyandrium of Myth Drannor . Like many other locations in the ruins of the elven city, the crypt was warded from graverobbers by a rune and a word of power . Kesefehon's tomb bore a rune of the wolf and was unlocked by the word "haturran".</p>
<p>He was buried along with jars of fragrant black tar-like viscous liquid. They made his crypt smell of flowers even hundreds of years after his death. In life, its liquid was a healing ointment, one of the few things that managed to ease the elf's suffering and calm his rage.</p>
<p>He was entombed wearing his magic +2 breastplate of silent moves and a beautifully crafted +1 elven longsword with a keen enchantment.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before his death, Kesefehon proved his bravery and valor by leading Myth Drannor's defenses against countless invasions, keeping the city safe and sound, earning himself many accolades and a loyal following.</p>
<p>Sometime in the middle of his life, the elven commander contracted a mysterious incurable disease that eventually left him mad and violent. His changed for the worse personality and constant violent episodes turned the court of public opinion against him. The leaders and the citizens of Myth Drannor confined the mad elf to his own home, with only his most loyal followers being among his sympathizers.</p>
<p>Kesefehon existed in his disgraced and mad state for several years until the disease ended his life. He was buried as a hero inside his crypt, on the assistance of those still loyal to the brave commander. The loyalists locked the crypt with the rune and the word of power , as well as placed numerous traps inside, in case any mobs decided to desecrate the hero's final resting place.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the elves of Myth Drannor, the disease gave Kesefehon unlife as a mummy, laying inside his tomb, and guarding it against scavengers.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , Kesefehon's crypt in Polyandrium was one of few that remained undisturbed by the occupying forces of the Cult of the Dragon . The members of the cult knew of the dangers inside and scribbled a warning message on the door in chalk to prevent anyone but Shamoor from entering.</p>
