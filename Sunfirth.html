<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sunfirth was working at the Bold Bard on Eleint 16 in the Year of the Shield, 1367 DR , and was left to clean up after a brawl between Rolf and Dovo , and probably when Dovo spat on the floor later. The next night it was Rolf and Jasper , and then she tried to chase and whack the mice Jasper secretly released as a ruse while he stole the account book. The night after , while obsessing on a murder case in his confused dreams, Jasper briefly theorized that an axe-wielding Sunfirth beheaded Dovo for the mess and Grodoveth for not tipping. Which, while unlikely, didn't seem unreasonable given what she put up with.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sunfirth stood around 5 feet and 2 inches (1.6 meters) tall and weighed about 110 pounds (50 kilograms), suggesting she was not in fact an axe-murderer.</p>
