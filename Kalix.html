<p>Kalix was a thri-kreen ranger active in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Kalix's chitinous carapace was blue and silvery in color and lined with spikes. He had pink accents on his antennae and elsewhere, and lighter markings that evoked a lotus theme. He decorated his body with twisted vines that supported leaves, lotus blooms, and blue crystalline plates. He used lotus seed pods as shoulder pads.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Kalix saw the world as a hunting ground, and everyone he met as either predator or prey. He was cold and calculating, but willing to change his mind. He respected those who could prove their might, and was eager to explore Toril and beyond.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Kalix was an exceptionally talented hunter and tracker, and a master of traditional thri-kreen weapons. As a thri-kreen, he possessed potent psionic talent, which he used to telepathically project himself to assist allies in battle, even at a great distance. He was particularly skilled in hunting humanoids , constructs , oozes , and celestials .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Kalix wielded both a chatkcha and a gythka , which he named Ka'eth'rek and Drak'en'raa , respectively. He possessed various precious gemstones to use as psionic foci. He also collected trophies from his many hunts, ranging from the mundane to the exotic. Kalix owned a map of the Shaar region, which he'd charted himself. He was the keeper of the Lyric of the Eternal Lotus for an unknown amount of time.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kalix was a member of the nomadic Krakk't tribe of thri-kreen. He was exiled for attacking emissaries of other groups at the Hill of Memories , and in turn became a wandering hunter for hire.</p>
<p>On his journeys, he explored and mapped the Shaar and became known to the nomads there.</p>
<p>Kalix was given a solbar gythka as payment to hunt a Calishite sultan. He was later hunted by another Calishite out of revenge, and melted down the failed hunter's skysteel weapon to forge a chatkcha for himself.</p>
<p>At some point during his exile, he found the Lyric of the Eternal Lotus under mysterious circumstances, and became its keeper.</p>
