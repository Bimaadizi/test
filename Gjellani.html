<p>Gjellani was a howling dragon , one of the many planar dragons summoned by Sammaster on Nightal 6 of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR to protect the dracorage mythal .</p>
<p>It was assigned during the battle to prevent the mages of Thentia from entering the Heart of the Rage, and it successfully struck them with its breath weapon. The timely intervention of Jivex and Taegan Nightwind bought them enough time to counterattack, and it was finally slain shortly after.</p>
