<p>Symbiont was a general term for a variety of disparate small sentient creatures that shared certain traits, chief amongst them being a need to live in a symbiotic (sometimes bordering on parasitic) relationship with another larger creature in order to survive. In exchange for these relationships, symbionts granted their hosts a variety of different benefits, in some cases acting much like a graft .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Symbionts were always aware of any dangers that their hosts were also aware of. Generally, harm befalling a host would not directly cause harm to a symbiont, including harm afflicted by spells , though symbionts could potentially be affected by spells in the same manner as a magic item . Symbionts and their hosts were not mutually affected by any spells targeted directly on one or the other by another spellcaster. However, any spell a host cast upon themselves would automatically affect their symbiont in turn and a symbiont, likewise, could cause any spell or spell-like ability targeting itself to also affect their host.</p>
<p>Symbionts and their hosts were both capable of casting on the other spells that had their target of effect limited to the caster themselves.
Additionally, the two could share their repertoire of spells with each other, even if those spells normally wouldn't affect creatures of the host or symbiont's type.</p>
<p>If a host creature's alignment and goals were ever in conflict with those of a symbiont, or if a symbiont's will and drive for power were exceptionally high, a conflict of personality was likely to occur between the two. Whenever this happened the host and symbiont each attempted to impose their will upon the other, winning complete control over the other for the rest of that day. This period of dominance could be cut short by the two being put in a critical situation, such as something that seriously threatened the lives of both host and symbiont.</p>

<p>Whilst these creatures were generally capable of surviving on their own for some degree of time, they were by and large too physically weak to sustain such a life.</p>
