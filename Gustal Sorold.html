<h2>Activities</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Per Storm Silverhand , Gustal Sorold had left his native Hillsfar and been in Shadowdale for three years in 1369 DR , where he'd become the head cook at the Old Skull inn; he was also an agent for the Zhentarim. On that year, during a revel in Warmfires House , he was brought upstairs as part of a group of people rounded up by Aldluck Dreen , which presumably also included Brezter . Of that group, he suddenly showed signs of saisha poisoning; his legs were broken with hammers, and then he was strangled by Taerach Thone while shoved inside a chest. The chest was closed and latched with his corpse inside.</p>
