<p>Tanova was a noble lady turned vampire .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Baldur's Gate , she met and married Jon Irenicus sometime after his exile from Suldanessellar .</p>
<p>Sometime after their marriage, she was murdered by a mage named Centeol , who was in love with Jon and believed that Jon would reciprocate her feelings. However, Jon tracked her down and put a curse on her as revenge. He took Tanova's body to be transformed into a vampire by Bodhi , after Jon Irenicus met her in Baldur's Gate.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Gorion's Ward fought her in the torture chamber in Bodhi's lair in Athkatla , Amn , and defeated her. However, she was not fully slain. She was later ordered to chase a Shadow Thief called Sansuki and again fought Gorion's Ward, but avoided defeat by transforming into mist.</p>
