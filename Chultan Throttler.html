<p>Chultan Throttler , known as nabuk-lai in its native lands, was a species of dangerous carnivorous vine plant found in the jungles of Chult .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>When prey approached a Chultan Throttler, its vines emerged from the soil and violently flared about, throttling the target. As the vines attacked, the plant's stalks quivered, either due to disruption or anticipation of a meal. The prey of a Chultan Throttler was just as likely to die by vine hits as by being entangled, dragged underground, and suffocated by them.</p>
<h2>Habitats</h2>
<p>Nabuk-lai were found only in Chult and doomed many unwitting would-be adventurers who traversed the jungles. Not many stories of Chultan Throttlers existed as deaths by dinosaurs was a much more impressive fate, leading many visitors to the jungles unawares of the deadly vines.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , a small specimen of Chultan Throttler could be found growing in a small enclosure in Mintassan's Mysteries curio store in Westgate 's Market Triangle . The plant's enclosure stopped it from growing to a dangerous size.</p>
