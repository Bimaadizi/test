<p>Chanragoupta's Exotic was a clothing and fabrics shop in Eileanar , an enclave of Netheril .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>Chanragoupta obtained fine and exotic textiles from around Toril , and even from the reaches of Realmspace on rare occasions via the brave spelljammers of Yeoman's Loft . His superior skill in business allowed him to steal some customers from Karmandon's Finery , causing Karmandon to resort to vicious rumor-mongering in an attempt to ruin Chanragoupta's reputation.</p>
