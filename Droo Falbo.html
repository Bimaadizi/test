<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , the Gondian foundry of Baldur's Gate was usurped by Enver Gortash and his cultists of Bane . Droo Falbo and other Gondians were forced to work on forging the Lord's steel watchers . Their families and loved ones were abducted and held hostage to encourage obedience, and all of the workers were outfitted with incineration collars controlled by Prinski's Motivators .</p>
<p>With the Absolute crisis unfolding in Baldur's Gate, the fate of the Gondians remained unconfirmed. It was possible for all of the hostages and foundry workers to perish, or be saved along with their loved ones by the group of heroes known as the Absolute Adversaries .</p>
