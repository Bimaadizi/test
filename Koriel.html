<p>Koriel was the patron god of the ki-rin , a vigilant deity that constantly roamed the many skies of the multiverse. He was the creator of the ki-rin, and much like his creations, the flying god of fate's appearance was a sign of a momentous importance.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In his avatar form, Koriel appeared as a 16‑foot-long (4.9‑meter) ki-rin with a rainbow-colored mane and gold-silver fur.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Koriel was a stern and observant god of lawful good offended by the persecution of the weak and utterly ruthless when driven to fight. He had incredible foreknowledge of what events he would come to face in the future, possessing much of the information known by the primary powers of fate on whichever world he was on, such as the Norns of the Norse pantheon . Conversely, Koriel was also a restless and ever-curious deity, both a serious patroller and great traveler. He was eager to discover new knowledge throughout the many worlds and many planes he roamed.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Koriel was believed to fly faster than any other part of creation, and could see perfectly as far as the horizon.</p>
<p>Koriel's avatar shared the magical powers of normal ki-rin. His song could banish summoned or conjured creatures, such as elementals , within 600‑foot (180‑meter) of himself. He fought with his hooves and horn, and any evil creature that was struck by his horn was at risk of instant death, merely being banished if not from the Prime Material Plane if they managed to resist the more lethal effect. In addition to his powers of destruction and banishment, the roaming god could resurrect someone and speak a holy word once per day.</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Koriel was a wanderer, and thus had no fixed home among the planes.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Just as ki-rin did on the Prime, Koriel soared throughout the Outer Planes searching for any encroachments by the forces of evil. Normally he did not greatly interfere with other beings unless actively evil creatures provoked his ire through wicked deeds or used powerful magic, and only in extreme cases did he deal with the problem himself (through an avatar) rather than use the preferred method of alerting mortal ki-rin to the issue. Rarely did he act in any world, and even then not often without consulting other deities, but when he did feel compelled to do so, the results would likely change history.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Koriel was alone in the skies, and rarely dealt with any other god or race of beings, even if he seldom acted solely of his own accord. Syranita , the aarakocra goddess, was the only deity of the skies known to talk with him. Aerdrie Faenya , the elven goddess known as the Lady of Air and Wind, was an ally of his, and Chan , the Princess of Good Aerial Creatures kept on good terms with him and helped him when needed. According to some legends, he was the father of Eachthighern , the god of unicorns and pegasi of the Seelie Court .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Koriel had no priests or shamans ; his magical creations were so naturally powerful that they needed no further blessings, although he sometimes communed with individuals when he so chose and sometimes when they invoked him. Aside from his own creations, many lammasu also revered him.</p>
<h3>Temples</h3>
<p>In the Outlands a sprawling, richly decorated, and well-staffed temple of Koriel stood within The Lady's Ward of the city Sigil , as they did for other gods of travelers and wandering.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>In some legends, Koriel was associated with a supreme god-figure of sorts, acting as their great steed. In some stories, this figure was a prime Creator God (such as some interpretations of Annam All-Father ), and in others it was the major lawful good god of some pantheon. Often in these legends, he and the god he allowed to ride him brought creative forces down to earth, or rode together at the end of time, creation, and all other things. This mythic connection meant that Koriel was treated with a certain level of gravitas, strengthening both his own magic powers and, by further association, those of the race he created.</p>
