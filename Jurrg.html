<h2>History</h2>
<p>Around 1369 DR , Jurrg received a dream from Gruumsh showing that a leader would soon emerge from the Underdark to lead the orcs of Thar to glory. So Jurrg went with her brother R没lgar to the X没l-Jarak citadel to welcome the leader. There, she met three just-arrived orogs : Naazlog , Daazlag , and their leader Thrull . She proclaimed them "sons of Gruumsh " and Thrull the new king of Thar. Together, they started to build the new kingdom.</p>
<p>In 1374 DR, R没lgar found the Hammer of Gruumsh and Jurrg saw this as a sign that the time of Thrull's rule was near. Meanwhile, thanks to Daazlag, the orcs captured the scions of five powerful noble houses from Melvaunt . Jurrg planned to ritually sacrifice them in the crowning ceremony for Thrull.</p>
<p>Jurrg was in her cave inside X没l-Jarak, waiting to perform the ceremony to proclaim Thrull king of all Thar.</p>
