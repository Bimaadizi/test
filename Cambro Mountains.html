<p>The Cambro Mountains were a mountain range located on the island of Gwynneth within the Moonshae Isles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The mountains were granite pinnacles streaked with glaciers and chains of high-altitude lakes. Long a place of dwarven mining, many of these mountains appeared sundered, with valleys marked by cliffs of exposed inner rock and red hills of tailings.</p>
<p>Beneath the surface, the mountains were full of artificial shafts and caverns dug over generations, some of which connected all the way to the Underdark . By the late 15 th century DR , these mines all lay abandoned.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Cambro Mountains ran north to south in northern Gwynneth, forming much of the western border of Myrloch Vale . They met the Highlands at Synnoria near the southeast arm of the Myrloch . The Cambro Mountains were approximately 75 miles (120 kilometers) long. They were split in the north by the Cambrent Gap .</p>
<p>The stretch of the range separating Synnoria from the Sacred Grove of the Earthmother in Myrloch Vale was referred to as the Cambro Ridge .</p>
