<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Activities & Relationships</h2>
<p>She took her orders from Daerdatha , and acted as liaison to Auvrurn Labraster in Waterdeep through Mrilla Malsander .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR , Brelma was among the guests at a party in Halonder Eldeglut 's home, where she was part of a crowd of drow planning to replace him and his wife Iyrevven Eldeglut with impersonators; they used spell-disguises to enter the party as invited guests. She'd been part of the infiltration party in Scornubel long enough to learn that the people replaced were all too often sent to Chult as slaves. When the drow at the party discovered Qilué Veladorn , a Chosen of Mystra , had replaced one of their own spell-changed drow infiltrators. After she was finally subdued, Brelma followed the sorceress Daerdatha's instructions to make a group mind-link and so overwhelm the infiltrator, allowing them to mind-touch her as a team. Brelma made her way to Waterdeep across the Sword Coast in the same night, presumably by teleporting , departing well after Qilué Veladorn's body was dumped into the Chionthar . She was inadvertently marked with a tracing spell when the woman bit her while she was being prepared for the mind-touch.</p>
<p>At a party on Waterdeep that same night, she related the events to a merchant, Mrilla Malsander, and then headed to Skullport . She was tracked by two of the Seven Sisters, Laeral Silverhand and Qilué Veladorn. Brelma led the two Chosen into an ambush, and then disappeared into the home of Auvrurn Labraster. They lost her track shortly after.</p>
