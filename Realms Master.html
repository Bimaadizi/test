<h2>History</h2>
<p>For at least some time, the Astrolabe of Nimbral was equipped to the Realms Master to facilitate Dwalimar's search of artifacts on behalf of the Netyarch Zalathorm Kirkson .</p>
<p>The ship was destroyed during the Time of Troubles by Labelas Enoreth in Vartan Hai Sylvar's body, who tried to use it to kill Helm at the Celestial Stairway</p>
