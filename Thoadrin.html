<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late 1357, Thoadrin hired Marlel in Scornubel to capture Shandril Shessair . He arranged for the payment to come down in a chest with five hundred top grade Calishite rubies . Thoadrin later led some of the forces that raided the caravan, though he'd promised Marlel not to make arrangements for others to attempt the same task; after the harrying at Face Crag , he meant to take his forces across Two Pools , an overland trail, then restock at Dowan Pool , and be ready to harry the caravan again two days after. He restocked there, introducing himself as the 'Dragonbone fool on a horse'. After that, he hurried his forces to set an ambush along the way to Haelhollow . The ambush was set along the Trade Way . His next ambush, however, was overshadowed by a spell-battle taking place in the caravan.</p>
<p>He was injured with spellfire in that battle, and fled with Laranthan , another Cult warrior, meaning to lay low in Waterdeep until their superiors had moved on from the matter.</p>
