<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Although he was biologically young, Tolivast had the aspect of a balding old man as a consequence of his use of necromancy .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1479 DR, Tolivast was operating out of Neverwinter under the orders of Valindra Shadowmantle . When Valindra learned that Seldra Tylmarande had obtained the Crown of Neverwinter , she tasked Tolivast to steal the Crown , as Valindra hoped to use it to advance the Thayan agenda in the region.</p>
<p>Tolivast was able to steal the Crown when Seldra arrived in Neverwinter, and then he went to hide in Neverdeath , where he cursed the Crown with a spell of madness, following Valindra's instructions.</p>
<p>However, a group of adventurers hired by Seldra were able to track Tolivast down to the cemetery and after a difficult fight against the undead under Tolivast's control, were able to kill him and retrieve the Crown .</p>
