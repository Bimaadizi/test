<p>T'lar Mizz'rynturl was a drow assassin member of the Velkyn Velve .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>T'lar was once a noble of House Mizz'rynturl of the city of Guallidurth until she joined the Velkyn Velve, the assassin branch of the new Temple of the Black Mother , renouncing all her bond to better honor Lolth .</p>
<p>In 1378 DR , she was chosen to kill Nafay Mizz'rynturl , an old childhood friend who was in secret a traitor priestess of Vhaeraun and Eilistraee (combined as the Masked Lady). T'lar followed Nafay to the surface and observed her dealing with a wild elf . T'lar attacked and killed Nafay but out of curiosity tried to investigate more about this unusual meeting, sparing for a moment the wild elf.</p>
<p>He took her to a very ancient temple to Lolth on the surface. There T'lar sacrificed him to Lolth and this triggered the appearance of Halisstra Melarn . The Lady Penitent presented herself and T'lar proclaimed that she would spread devotion to the Lady inside her temple.</p>
<p>In 1379 DR T'lar was in Sshamath as head of a new College of Bae'qeshel Magic that Master Guldor Zauviir tried to elevate as new member of the Conclave.</p>
<p>Later she discussed with Guldor and his aunt Streea'Valsharess Zauviir , the city high priestess of Lolth, about why their plot failed. Under orders of The Lady Penitent T'lar killed Guldor and later menaced Q'arlynd Melarn .</p>
<p>After T'lar killed also Streea'Valsharess and took control of her temple, informing her Lady about the news and she ordered to T'lar to kill Q'arlynd.</p>
<p>Just after Q'arlynd had engineered (with the aid of Eilistraee) the ritual that transformed all drow not tainted by Wendonai 's blood into brown-skinned dark elves T'lar tied to kill him but Q'arlynd instead killed her thank to a contingency spell. She so joined Lolth in her realm.</p>
