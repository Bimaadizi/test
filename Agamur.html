<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , Agamur was one of the pit fiends under Geryon when he came after the Simbul , who was scouring Avernus in search of Elminster Aumar . Together with Perstur , he was sent directly to follow a cloud of blue fire, in which the Simbul was hiding; all of the pit fiends close to it were crushed later, when a mountain crag was magically thrown on top of them all.</p>
