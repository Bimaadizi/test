<p>Dahl Timber was a potato farmer and an alleged spy during the Harper- Reithwin conflict in the Western Heartlands of the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When General Ketheric Thorm started an almost-successful campaign to wipe out Selûnite sympathies and took over absolute tyrannical control of the Reithwin town, the winter of the 1373 DR , ended up in an armed conflict between the Dark Justiciars under Ketheric and the Harper , allied with the Emerald Enclave . During that conflict, Dahl was taken prisoner by the Harpers and interrogated by Calidove Everspring . The interrogation transcript was penned by Luna Shorn . It recorded the interrogation in which Dahl claimed to be just a potato farmer. Calidove zealously pushed the farmer to reveal the number of troops stationed on Reithwin's southern walls. When Dahl was unable or unwilling to disclose, Calidove ordered the transcriber to record the spy's refusal to cooperate and the harsher methods of interrogation to come.</p>
