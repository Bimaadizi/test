<h2>Description</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>She carried a backpack full of a variety of disguises, as well as leather armor +1 , a short sword +3 , a ring of invisibility , and a potion of healing .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Lyrissa was born into a noble family. Later in life, she ran away from home when her parents tried to force her into an arranged marriage and took up the life of a thief . She became quite adept at making a living thieving, at one point adventuring with a fighter by the name of Kiera . Later, that same fighter would call her up to join five other women in forming the adventuring company Iron Maidens. Over time she and the rest of the company became enemies of Fzoul Chembryl .</p>
<p>One day a rich merchant hired the Iron Maidens for a mission, that turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by agents of Fzoul. All but Kiera and Lyrissa were killed in the process, the two having escaped the trap, and Lyrissa having taken a golden necklace with a diamond in its center from Fzoul's treasury that was worth around 12,000 gold pieces . Later they exacted revenge upon the merchant, Kiera killing him. From then on, Lyrissa tried to shy away from her thieving ways and take up the ways of a fighter. She also held on to the necklace she had stolen, worried that fencing it would give Fzoul a clue to their whereabouts.</p>
