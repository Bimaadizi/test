<p>Gambiton was a small village in southern Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The tiny village was home to two businesses of note that faced each other across the intersection. The Gambitavern was its tavern, and the Gambitinn was the inn.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The village lay at the intersection of the Imnescourse Trail and the South Road , a few miles south of the King's Arch bridge across the River Esmel that led to Esmeltaran . To the east near Lake Esmel was the Five Silvers , a ring of ancient standing stones .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Gambiton gained its name from "Imnel's Gambit," as it was the site where Prince Imnel Torlath I divided his forces in two during the Ogre Wars in the Year of Forestsfrost, 479 DR . The nearby Vale of the Wailing Women was named for the lamentations as his soldiers marched away, and Imnescar was named for the eventual battle that he won after splitting his army.</p>
<p>The village was destroyed in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , in the opening of the Sothillisian War . An army of Skullgnasher hill giants and Spearbiter goblins poured from the Small Teeth and quickly overran the nearby Hillfort Ishla , and then razed Gambiton the following day on Eleasis 8 on the way to Esmeltaran. The surviving population fled to the west and north.</p>
