<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was a wholly vicious man that held little to no loyalty for others, even within the greater church of Cyric .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Argrim held a particular hatred for Blackwill Haarken Akhmelere of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse . Each of them claimed that their temple was the greatest in all of southwestern Faer√ªn .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Tynnos Argrim secured an invitation for himself to a rival temple of Cyric, the Dark Redoubt under pretense of discussing the Cyricist faith. After entering within, he slew the temple's head priest and brought its clergy under his own influence. He then installed Dark Master K'rvan as the new high priest of the Dark Redoubt to ensure his control over his newly-aquired congregation.</p>
<p>When the Sothillisian War broke out in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR , he allied his forces with Amn against the Sothillisisan Empire .</p>
