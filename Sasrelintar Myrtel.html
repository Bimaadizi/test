<p>Sasrelintar Myrtel was the proprietor of Myrtel's Stargirt Wonders , the so-called "Shop of Wonders," in the Gem District of Athkatla in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sasrelintar was an attractive dark-skinned and black-haired man of 5 feet (1.5 meters). His reserved manner of speech and delicate child-like features put people at ease. His body moved silently with elegance.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Sasrelintar enjoyed maintaining a certain mystique about himself. He claimed to have arrived in Amn from Lantan , despite having an uncharacteristic skin color for a Lantanna and lacking any interest in mechanical gadgets. His trade in magical miscellany was in high demand among Amnian lovers of all things showy and flamboyant.</p>
<p>When asked about his past or any of the numerous rumors about his allegiances, Sasrelintar answered with a polite smile.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>The shop's proprietor's true powers were unknown. He might as well have been nothing but a wizardly meddler with an interest in enchanted items.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Sasrelintar's shop was a sizable building on Coront Street of the Gem District. People claimed that his fanciful rings were none other than rings of spell storing of undisclosed properties.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Despite his own claims of hailing from Lantan, rumors claimed that Sasrelintar Myrtel was once a toymaker from Calimport until causing someone's wrath and fleeing the country. Since he opened his Stargirt Wonders shop, along with his assistant Drestan , Sasrelintar had taken the lives of several thieves, assassins, and kidnappers who were reckless enough to target the man. He also was known or rumored to have some connections to prominent and wealthy Amnian families. Some thought him to be the infamous "small, dark, and silent man" who procured the rarest of all magical items, such as Halruaan skyships for his clients, while others claimed Sasrelintar Myrtel was on the Council of Six's payroll. More outlandish rumors aligned him with Shadow Thieves , some secretive wizardly organization, and even Red Wizards of Thay . The truth could be that he worked for all of these organizations.</p>
<p>Another well-known rumor was that Sasrelintar had dug out a cavern underneath the Shop of Wonders, where he tested the magics of his goods. The cavern initially was three cellars that became one after a magical explosion years before the late 14 th century DR .</p>
