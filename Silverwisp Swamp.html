<p>The Silverwisp swamp was a fetid patch of wetlands found in the Sword Coast North region of the North .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Silverwisp swamp was densely forested with coniferous trees with interspaced bogs found within. Rough dirt trails wound through the wetlands, at times becoming submerged in its dark-colored waters.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It was found near southern stretch of the High Road , just north of the Mere of Dead Men near the Sword Mountains .</p>
<h3>Geographical Features</h3>
<p>The swamp housed numerous barrow mounds of the Uthgardt barbarians. Some of their most prolific and deadly warriors were interred within.</p>
<p>Within the vast swamp were two notable landmarks, the Maridain Mire and the Valley of the Ancients. The latter of which housed the remains of a terrifying black dragon that plagued the swamp for years.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>In addition to the undead that ran rampant during the late 15 th century, Silverwisp swamp was home to many large spiders , such as deathjump spiders .</p>
<p>Selûne's Tear flowers were known to grow throughout the swamp.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point during the mid–to–late 15 th century DR , undead poured out from the graves and crypts of Ebon Downs , and overwhelmed the local village . In response, Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter dispatched the Neverwinter Guard clergy members of the church of Kelemvor directed by Doomguide Vesper Soulhearth to keep them from completely overrunning the region. The undead were in fact being raised by an ancient Netherese necromancer named Idris , armed with a powerful artifact known as the Deathknell . Neverwinter's forces were no match for the arcanist and her undead, and were all but entirely destroyed.</p>
<p>Contact was made with Soulhearth and his surviving allies in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . Together with the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge , Soulhearth and an adventurer ally were able to put to rest the ghosts that remained tethered the ruined village, slew the wights , zombies , and other undead that infested the swamp, and defeated the undead Idris and his lieutenants.</p>
<p>Some time later in the 1480s DR, the restored Cult of the Dragon began excavations in locales throughout Silverwisp swamp. They sought the grave of the ancient barbarian warrior Belast Messandar , in the hopes to gain more information about a portal that led to the isle of Tuern . Their efforts were thwarted by Acolyte Heiron and Preceptor Theraclast of the Order of the Gauntlet , and the same hero that helped slay Idris some years before.</p>
