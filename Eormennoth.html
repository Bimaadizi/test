<p>Eormennoth was a bronze dragon who guarded the treasury of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eormennoth was a good-looking dragon. His name translated to 'immense treasure' in Draconic .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Eormennoth was refined, meticulous, and patient. He had a sense of humor. He was often curious about the world outside his vaults and enjoyed gossip. He had a particular affinity for the ocean.</p>
<p>While he did not particularly enjoy living so close to so many humanoids, he appreciated that his lair was heavily guarded, and liked the coastal position of Ravens Bluff.</p>
<p>Eormennoth was prepared to be a good mate, but it was unlikely that he could remain on good terms with a female bronze dragon for a long period of time. Following this, he was prepared to be a generous father.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>As a bronze dragon, Eormennoth could breathe water. He was also able to control powerful magics. He had access to ESP , polymorph self , weather summoning , create food and water , airy water , charm person , ventriloquism , invisibility , magic mouth , sepia snake sigil , and command .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Eormennoth owned a significant pile of coins exceeding 180,000 gp by 1370 DR . He had gradually taken these coins from the treasury of Ravens Bluff as his payment for his position as guard.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Eormennoth spent nearly all of his time inside the vaults of Ravens Bluff, guarding them. He only allowed funds to be withdrawn if they were approved by a writ that had been certified. While he watched the gold, he quietly collected his payment of 10 gp from it each day.</p>
<p>To enjoy the outside world, he sometimes spent time at the Ravens Bluff docks , polymorphed as a cat , humanoid , or any other animal. After many years of service to the city, he was also comfortable taking brief aerial or aquatic jaunts as himself. He only attacked pirates in his territory when they committed crimes. He would often demand a payment from any pirate ships that he caught, in gems , pearls , or even shark meat.</p>
<p>By 1370 DR, he was actively searching for a female bronze dragon to be his mate, so that he could produce offspring.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Eormennoth was friends with the tomboyish and adventurous Imramarthree Emmerdin , the younger daughter of Eskevelt Emmerdin .</p>
<p>Eormennoth hated pirates. A number of pirate crews that had once been defeated by Eormennoth sought vengeance against him. Kothonos , a guildmaster in Ravens Bluff, had once been one of these pirates, but Eormennoth had faith that he was reformed.</p>
<p>Although he was unaware of it, Eormennoth threatened to bankrupt the city of Ravens Bluff with the portion of the treasury that he had collected for himself. City officials like Charles Oliver O'Kane and Vernon Condor had made various plans to take the wealth back from him.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In his younger years, Eormennoth came to lair in Ravens Bluff and attacked pirates along the coast. His first proper battle against pirates was a great success. He destroyed the ship's mast and defeated the pirates, some of whom were under the impression that Eormennoth was some kind of illusion . An informal agreement was established by the Lord Treasurer of Ravens Bluff that Eormennoth would be paid 10 gold pieces for each day of his service, upon the dragon's retirement.</p>
<p>Soon after Charles Oliver O'Kane became Lord Mayor of Ravens Bluff, he planned to manipulate Eormennoth into defeating pirates for him. He spread false rumors of a wealthy cargo in the city harbor, which tricked pirate crews into attacking. Eormennoth defeated the pirates, and O'Kane won his favor by sharing the loot with him. By this time, the terms of Eormennoth's original agreement were long-forgotten. O'Kane and his Regent of the Exchequer, Vernon Condor, were both surprised to learn that the dragon was in the city's employ. Condor held a discussion with Eormennoth over a period of three days, and gifted him with pearls to eat. Condor learned about the arrangement, and became concerned about the amount of money that Eormennoth had collected.</p>
<p>Although some elves had a longer view of the situation, Condor convinced O'Kane to change the terms of the original agreement. They planned to charge Eormennoth a special "dragon tax" and confiscate half of his wealth, even preparing a cube of force and a magic longsword especially powerful against bronze dragons should the negotiations turn sour. However, O'Kane was replaced by Amber Lynn Thoden , and Eormennoth remained in the employ of the city. By 1370 DR , he had protected the vault for over 50 years, and was actively seeking a mate.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>A number of years prior to 1370 DR, it was falsely claimed that Eormennoth had died.</p>
