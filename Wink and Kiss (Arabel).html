<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Wink and Kiss was known around Arabel as a place to get good meals and gossip.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During Gondegal 's war in 1352 DR , the Cormyrean counter-attack was to be conducted by magically blasting the wall apart. Baron Thomdor Ammaeth sadly noted that the Wink and Kiss would likely be destroyed in the process, but before the assault could commence Gondegal vanished and his army collapsed.</p>
<p>The tavern suffered a mysterious fire in 1365 DR during the Night of Masks festival, burning at least partially down.</p>
<p>The Puppetmasters gang of adventurers used the Wink and Kiss as their home base while working on schemes in 1369 DR .</p>
