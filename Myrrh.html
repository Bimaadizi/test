<h2>Description</h2>

The Bedine usually traded plant resins such as myrrh, frankincense, dragons' blood, and cassia to the D'tarig and other outsiders in exchange for metals they couldn't obtain otherwise. The D'tarig were their most common trade partner and also harvested myrrh and other resins themselves, typically selling it on to Zhentarim merchants who then exported it on to the rest of the Realms .</p>
