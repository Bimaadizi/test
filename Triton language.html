<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>To modify a word to be a collective term, such as in order to refer to the members of a family or the various colonies surrounding the capital of one of their protectorates, tritons would add a "(a)th" to the interceding vowel where needed. For example, the Pumana Protectorate and Vuuvax Protectorate would be rendered as Pumanath and Vuuvaxath respectively. When used with a name, such as Numyn, depending upon the context it could refer to either possessions of the individual or their children.</p>
