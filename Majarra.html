<p>The noble house of Majarra ( pronounced : / m ɑː ˈ dʒ ɑːr r ɑː / mah-JAR-ra ) was a member of the nobility of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR . They were primarily interested in making musical instruments , harping , and teaching others to play the harp. They also had a silver mining business in Mirabar .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The official patriarch of the family was Lord Kelthul Majarra and his consort was Lady Regan . However, by the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , he had passed the management of the family businesses to his two eldest sons, Axor and Kehlann , while Lord Kelthul served as the full-time president of New Olamn bardic college. Axor, his consort Larin , and their two young children lived in Mirabar where he oversaw the family's silver mining operations. Kehlann resided in Waterdeep and took care of the instrument-making enterprise and any other business that did not fall under the purview of Kelthul at New Olamn. In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , there were seventeen noble members of the family.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Majarra family were strong financial supporters of the Church of Oghma and New Olamn. Several members of the family were on the faculty of the bardic college. Their silver mining business directly fed their instrument-making efforts and their wares, including flutes , longhorns , and bells were known throughout northeast Faerûn . In particular, their silver-belled tocken gained favor in the region and there was a time in the 1370s when one could hear daily tocken concerts when traversing the Mount Melody Walk to or from New Olamn.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The family villa was a walled compound of three- and four-story buildings surrounding a small green space located on the southeast corner of Sulmor Street and Ussilbran Street in the North Ward . Axor Majarra maintained a residence in the mining city of Mirabar beginning in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to their silver mines around Mirabar, an instrument-making shop, and the family villa, the Majrras owned some minor land holdings around the Ice Lakes . They also owned the rental villa known as Stormwatch , but Lord Kelthul donated it (or sold it for a very low price) to be part of New Olamn when it was rededicated in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Lord Kelthul was a strong supporter of Danilo Thann and the reformation of a bardic college in Waterdeep. The Majarra clan were significant donors to the Church of Oghma and the New Olamn bardic college.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The members of this house were the descendants of the Harpshields that were ennobled as part of the kingdom of Delimbiyran in the Year of the Hunting Ghosts, 659 DR . After the collapse of that realm, the Harpshields declared themselves rulers over what became known as the Harpshield Lands (located around the southeastern border of Ardeep Forest ) in the Year of the Triton's Horn, 697 DR . This small kingdom survived for two-and-a-half centuries until the drow raids in the Year of the Circling Vulture, 942 DR . The survivors fled to Nimoar's Hold and joined Warlord Gharl in building what became Waterdeep, eventually taking the name Majarra and ascending to the nobility in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR . Over the centuries, their royal heritage was mostly forgotten.</p>
<p>In 1360 DR, Axor Majarra took over the managing of the family's silver mining operations in Mirabar. Sometime between the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR and 1366, Lord Kelthul turned over the operations of the family businesses to his two eldest sons. In 1366 DR, New Olamn was rededicated and Lord Kelthul soon became its president.</p>
