<p>Nimbral ( pronounced : / n ɪ m ˈ b r ɑː l / nim-BRALL ), also known as The Sea Haven , was an island nation that was probably the most mysterious land in all of Toril . Hippogriff - and pegasus -mounted warriors attacked a lot of foreign merchants (though almost always because they were slavers or pirates) and large fleets that headed in the supposed direction of the island had a history of being turned away.

<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The land was ruled over by an introverted intermarried family of 26 archmages known as the Nimbral Lords and their 16 apprentices, all of whom lived in the linked towers of Salpir . Their will was carried out by the Heralds of Nimbral and enforced by the Knights of the Flying Hunt . The Nimbral Lords were led by five Elders they fiercely protected the isolation of Nimbral and maintained strict secrecy about their abilities, apprehensive of potential assaults from formidable magical factions like the Red Wizards of Thay , the Arcane Brotherhood , the Cult of the Dragon , or the Twisted Rune in case their capabilities became known to the outside world.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>Nimbral was self-sufficient and only traded with Samarach , Halruaa (both of these only infrequently though) and Zakhara , all mysterious and nigh-unknown lands themselves. As a result, many wild and varied rumours have been spread by the folk of the mainland who have heard of the place. [ citation needed ]</p>
<h2>People and culture</h2>
<p>Expatriates from Halruaa willing to put a premium on the school of illusion, the deceptive inhabitants of the distant island of Nimbral were all accomplished illusionists . It seemed their prolonged contact with magic changed their mages into something other than humans. Nimbral illusionists did not have any forbidden school of magic. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>Many islanders were well-versed in local lore, which includes historical events such as shipwrecks, the arrival and defeat of dragons , significant births and deaths of both notable figures and personal kin, among others.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>All Nimbrese spoke both Common and Halruaan . Common was primarily used for everyday conversations, while Halruaan was reserved for religious rituals, familial and communal traditions, ballads, and formal occasions. Most used Iokharic script daily, and many were also familiar with Elven and the Espruar script. . Additionally, the Nimbrali developed Ruathlek , the secret language of illusionists, for both magical and mundane activities.</p>
<h3>Calendar and Timekeeping</h3>
<p>Nimbral followed the Calendar of Harptos . The islanders also adhered to the standard Roll of Years .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Nimbral was located about 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) south of the Moonshae Isles . There was no magical way to get to the island. Teleport and other motive spells stoped functioning when the destination desired was somewhere on the island. Thus, all transportation to Nimbral had to be non-magical in nature. Spelljammers approaching from the air were required to touch down on the island's northern side; elsewhere, the spaceships would stop descending within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of the ground.</p>
<p>Nimbral was a land of gently rolling terrain and lush forests, with abundant water sources like small brooks and ponds. The Ormarr River was the only major river, navigable from its mouth to the cascades originating from Maern Prestarr , the highest peak of the Seirsardar mountain range . These mountains acted as a barrier against occasional "Great Waves" from the sea to the west. The landscape of Nimbral was dominated by dense forests, with marshes and farms scattered sparingly. Farms were typically individual clearings connected by a network of dirt lanes that crisscross the realm. High meadows could be found primarily on the rising slopes of the Maerns, particularly along the eastern side of the Seirsardar and the southern face of the Vaerael , the mountain range at the island's northern tip.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The island's latitude, combined with the cooling sea breezes that typically swept over it, results in short, mild winters during the month of Hammer , characterized by rains, cold mists, and mud. This was followed by a month or so of warming weather accompanied by dense fogs. Summers on Nimbral were long and gentle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Nimbral has an history shrouded in mystery. Moon elfs colonized this forested island long ago and, at some point after 173 DR , welcomed several Halruaan worshipers of Leira who, dissatisfied with the stranglehold that worshipers of Mystra and Azuth had gained over the Council of Elders , departed Halruaa in skyships. Intermarriage between elves and humans became common, and their descendants lived in harmony on the island for many years. The elves who did not want to coexist so closely with humans eventually abandoned Nimbral. It wasn't too long before there were hardly any pure-blooded elves left on the island.</p>
<p>In 605 DR the Nimbrese were asked to help destroy the yuan-ti of what was then Western Thindol . Lord Samar agreed to return with the Thindolese and battle the yuan-ti. A year after, in 606 DR , the western Thindolese, with the aid of Lord Samar and Nimbral, drove the yuan-ti from their Sanrach Basin home. Afterwards, the Nimbrese Lord veiled the surrounding mountain passes in powerful illusions, protecting the region from further infiltration of the serpentfolk. The land became known as Samarach and was considered a vassal state of Nimbral by the natives.</p>
<p>The priesthood of Leira became more and more powerful as time went on and, whilst still a peaceful realm, Nimbral became the playground of the Leirans. [ citation needed ]</p>
<p>When Leira, the state patron goddess, allegedly died during the Time of Troubles , brief strife reigned as her priests were all slain or driven from the realm by indentured wizards who had been made to create magic items for the priesthood. This put an end to the constant and unnecessary "Dreamweaving" (altering another's perception of the world through methods that ranged from something as simple as lying to magically manipulating the dreams of people) that the priesthood practiced on the island's citizens. These wizards became the new Nimbral Lords and decided that religion was a self-limiting thing and banned organized priesthoods and state religions from the realm, individual priests and small shrines are still allowed though if they are found to offend the law, exile is added to the usual punishment for the offense.</p>
<p>Nimbral first came to the common attention of mainlanders in the Year of the Shield ( 1367 DR ) when the Knights of the Flying Hunt descended upon the Nelanther Isles and left many pirate ships ablaze off the coast of Tethyr . Before this event, they were only really known to pirates and Calishite slavers, mostly because their property had been destroyed by the same knights. A lot of mainlanders previously unaware of Nimbral were unsure what to feel about this event, on the one hand, they lauded the knights for destroying all of those pirate ships, on the other, they had no idea if the Nimbrese will restrict themselves to attacking pirates or begin raidng mainland cities. Halruaan Skyships soon took to the air and headed towards Nimbral, but it is unknown what exactly their goal was, or if they succeeded. The skyships returned home and no more was said about it that wasn't pure speculation.</p>
<p>At some point during the Spellplague , the island of Nimbral vanished without a trace. Speculation abounded regarding its fate: some believed it had sunk beneath the waves, others posited that it had been concealed by powerful illusions, while yet another theory suggested it had been transported to a distant plane.</p>
<p>By 1479 DR , not a single ship encountered the island in almost a century.</p>
<p>At some point in 1483 DR , after the Second Sundering , ships claiming to be from Nimbral sailed into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South . The island's rulers maintained a secretive stance regarding the events surrounding Nimbral's disappearance and reappearance, leaving many unanswered questions about the island's history and the motives of its mysterious lords.</p>
