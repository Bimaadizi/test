<p>Valygar Corthala was a member of the noble Amnian Corthala family who eschewed his arcane heritage to live a life of his own. He sought to defend the natural world from the taint of arcane magic .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Valygar was a decidedly stoic man who only spoke when he felt it was so required. He absolutely despised arcane magic and believed it twisted both the soul of its practitioners.</p>
<p>Unlike many in the Realms, Valygar held no veneration for any deity.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among his possessions were a custom suit of chainmail and a unique katana that had been carried by members of his family.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Valygar had few friends or acquaintances save for a few allied rangers and his manservant Hervo .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many members of the Corthala family have demonstrated magical aptitude and skill throughout its generations. Among his ancestors was the powerful necromancer , Lavok Corthala .</p>
<p>At one point Valygar served in the Amnian military as a scout. He honed his skills as a martial fighter after years of fighting against unnatural beings.</p>
<p>Valygar's mother was a mage who suffered from mental health issues, like many in her family. This affliction was believed by Valygar to be a result of her arcane practices. She spent much of the family's wealth on magical items to the point of obsession and wholly neglected her son and husband.</p>
<p>When Valygar's father died his mother was distraught. In her despair, she raised her partner as a zombie and underwent the process of becoming undead herself. Valygar slew both of his parents, a deed he felt he was forced to carry out.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Cowled Wizard Tolgerias began a manhunt for Valygar in Athkatla , as he was the last member of his bloodline. Tolgerias sought to gain entry into the Planar Sphere that suddenly appeared in the slums of Athkatla a few weeks prior. Valygar fled to his cabin in the Umar Hills , aided in hiding by Derrick and several other rangers. To circumvent the Cowled Wizard's pursuit, Valygar sought to secretly enter the sphere himself and bring an end to Lavok's schemes.</p>
