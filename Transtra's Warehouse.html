<p>Transtra's Warehouse was a warehouse in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Rising slightly above the neighboring buildings, the warehouse was a three-story timber and stone structure in poor condition, largely unremarkable in appearance and often overlooked by passersby.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The warehouse served as the storage facility for Transtra , and primarily held supplies for the House of the Long Slow Kiss festhall , including liquor, linens, foodstuffs, dishes, and various tableware that appeared refined but was inexpensive. Crates of tankards and glassware were also stored here, alongside any contraband Transtra is currently smuggling. In addition, the warehouse has occasionally served a more sinister purpose, acting as a temporary resting place for the corpses of those who have fallen afoul of its vindictive owner.</p>
