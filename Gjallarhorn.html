<p>The Gjallarhorn , also known as the Gjallerhorn or simply Gjaller , was a legendary magical signal horn that belonged to the Norse god Heimdall and together they acted as the alarm system for Asgard . He would sound it whenever anyone approached Asgard through the Bifrost , whether they were friend or foe.</p>
<p>Heimdall was known to hang the Gjallarhorn above the entrance to the hall of Himinborg, his divine realm and town within Asgard , whenever he was in court. A number of bards claimed that whenever Heimdall was away he hid the horn at the base of Yggdrasil , while others claimed he would hide it at the Well of Mimir .</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>It was said that whenever the Gjallarhorn was blown all creatures within 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) could hear it, regardless of anything mundane and or magical that would normally prevent sound from being heard. Others claimed it wasn't limited by range, but instead could potentially be heard by all living creatures in Ysgard , whilst all the Aesir and Vanir were guaranteed to hear it regardless of where they were and wherever it was blown. In terms of offensive capabilities, mortals within a 1 mi (1,600 m) of the Gjallarhorn when it was blown were likely to be rendered stunned by the sound for up to ten minutes or in some cases rendered permanently deaf .</p>
<p>Though he was its owner, Heimdall was not the sole person capable of using the horn. However, it was a difficult feat for anyone else to do, requiring high skills in instruments and in the use of magical items . Additionally, the sound produced was slightly different than the one made by Heimdall blowing it, a difference that all Norse deities were very liable to notice. The sound made to announce attackers versus the sound made to announce visitors were also distinct from one another.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Gjallarhorn was legendary among the people of Ysgard, for it was destined to one day blow to announce the long anticipated arrival of Ragnarok or the "Last Days" as some in Ysgard called it, a prophesied final battle for the Norse pantheon against various monsters and giants . Some went so far as to say this prophesied role was Heimdall's primary duty within the Norse pantheon.</p>
<p>At some point Reglin , one of Heimdall's proxies , had an imitation of the Gjallarhorn placed above the door of his own longhouse Gloamingard . It functioned merely as an alarm against attacks, lacking the powers of the original. One time this horn sounded when a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff were inside Gloamingard, warning its inhabitants of an incoming raiding party of frost giants .</p>
