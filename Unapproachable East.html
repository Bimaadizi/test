<h2>Realms</h2>
<h3>Aglarond</h3>
<p>Aglarond was an autocratic kingdom in the southwestern-most part of the Unapproachable East, with the capital of Velprintalar . It was a peninsula bordered on the west by the Sea of Fallen Stars and Altumbel and on the east by Thay. Most of its land was covered by the Yuirwood . Filled with magic and mystery, it was ruled by one of the most potent spellcasters of the Realms, the Simbul . In the north were the Dragonjaw Mountains . The population was mostly humans , who made up the nearly 1.3 million inhabitants, though one-third were half-elves and a fair number of elves .</p>
<p>Aglarond was once constantly fending off attacks from Thay, but a cease-fire led to brisk trade between the two nations around 1372 DR .</p>
<h3>Altumbel</h3>
<p>Altumbel was a "sub-peninsula", that is, a peninsula's peninsula or cape, located at the western end of the peninsula of Aglarond. Its capital was Spandeliyon , and the reclusive inhabitants distrusted non-humans. Its economy was mostly fishing.</p>
<h3>The Great Dale</h3>
<p>The Great Dale was governed by a druidic hierarchy, under the rule of the Nentyarch . It was a human land of 200,000 inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Impiltur</h3>
<p>Impiltur was a kingdom of 1,200,000 inhabitants, mainly humans, but also dwarves and halflings , who were ruled by the regent queen Sambryl from the capital of Lyrabar in the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h3>Rashemen</h3>
<p>Rashemen was a land of 650,000 people, almost all humans. It was ruled from the capital of Immilmar , where the ruler called the Iron Lord resided, but the true power in Rashemen were the famous Witches of Rashemen . In addition to the witches, Rashemen was also known for its berserker warriors and spirits that protect the land.</p>
<h3>Thay</h3>
<p>Thay was a magocracy of the dreaded Red Wizards . The coastal part of Thay was the Priador . Thay was constantly warring with its neighbors. Thayans were infamous for being slavers , a practice illegal in other lands.</p>
<h3>Thesk</h3>
<p>Thesk was a region consisting of 850,000 people, inhabited by humans , gnomes , and orcs , with no official capital, though the city-state of Phsant commonly filled that role. It was economically dependent on the city-state of Telflamm and Kara-Turan goods shipped from the far east.</p>
<p>Telflamm was a large city-state and a port. Its approximately 23,500 inhabitants were under the rule of a "merchant prince", though behind the scenes it was the Shadowmasters of Telflamm , a thieves guild, that ran the city.</p>
<h3>Ashanath</h3>
<p>Ashanath was a minor kingdom east of the Great Dale and Thesk, south of Narfell and north of Thay. Its capital city Shandaular was destroyed in −946 DR . Despite its fertile lands, it was mostly unsettled.</p>
