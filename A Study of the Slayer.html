<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>Regarding the Slayer book logged the research, observations, and musings of archmage Jon Irenicus in his quest to capture Abdel Adrian 's piece of divinity. Irenicus claimed that even Bhaalspawn who did not follow their divine progenitor's bloody calling, like Gorion's Ward did, the evil taint was inescapable. The Slayer was locked inside each of the Bhaalspawn, awoken by strong feelings of divine rage and bloodlust, unachievable by simple mortals. This meeting of hatred pleased the deity. When a Bhaalspawn transformed into the Slayer, Bhaal's own avatar, their mind became shattered. Irenicus discovered that in his attempts to extract the essence from multiple Bhaalspawn. In his observation, the archmage also noted that Abdel Adrian, the Bhaalspawn of Candlekeep , might have been the Lord of Murder's favorite seed, pointing Irenicus towards his goal – capturing Gorion's Ward and extracting his divine essence.</p>
