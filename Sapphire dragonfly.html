<p>A sapphire dragonfly was a large, blue dragonfly that could be found in northwest Faerûn , including Icewind Dale , the Sword Coast North , and the Savage Frontier .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , a sapphire dragonfly found its way into the home of Edgin and Zia Darvis in Targos . While Edgin moved to kill or capture the insect, Zia opened a window to "let it go". After Zia's death at the hands of a Red Wizard , a sapphire dragonfly appeared above her pyre, and henceforth the insect would remind Edgin of his lost wife. Eleven years later, the sight of such a dragonfly would ultimately help him to move on from his grief when he realized that he had to let his wife go just as she had once let the dragonfly go.</p>
