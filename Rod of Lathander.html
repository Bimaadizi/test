<p>The rod of Lathander was a unique magic item that glowed with powerful daylight from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The rod was 2 feet (0.61 meters) long and had a tapered end that flattened into a serrated half-disc. The blades of the disc were embedded with rubies , rose-colored diamonds , and corundums . Removal of any of the gemstones would cause them to crumble into dust and the rod's magic would cease to function until they were replaced with a similar stone worth at least 5,000 gp .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Creatures within 60 feet (18 meters) of the shining rod of Lathander were protected by a death ward effect.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Commissioned by a paladin named, Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand , the rod of Lathander was created within the Spires of the Morning in the Year of Lathander's Light, 1024 DR . The rod was wielded by Dahaerlin in the Shadow Plane while he rescued the lost villagers of Hespheira . Following Dahaerlin's death, the rod sat upon the altar of the Morninglord within the Spires of the Morning for over a century until the Year of the Shadowkin Return, 1136 DR , when it was needed again to rescue Hespheira from shadow creatures. The rod returned to its place of honor until the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR , when it was stolen by thieves .</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Following its theft, a rumor persisted of a brightly illuminated cavern in Undermountain that led many of the Morninglord's faithful to believe it was the power of the rod of Lathander . Several expeditions ensued but none met with success in retrieving the rod.</p>
