<p>A spell focus or focus was a basic tool used in spellcasting.</p>
<p>A focus was simply an item of some kind that was necessary for successful casting of certain spells. Unlike material components , spell foci were not consumed by the casting of the spell and could be reused. Like material components, spell foci were usually small enough to store in a spell component pouch and were very cheap, but there were notable exceptions to this.</p>
