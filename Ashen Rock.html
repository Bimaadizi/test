<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the events of the death curse in the late 15 th century DR, Ashen Rock was a member of a Citizens' Brigade rescue party that embarked into the jungle when a group of pterafolk attacked Malar's Throat and abducted several residents. Ashen Rock became separated from the group and captured by the pterafolk, whom he observed to be erratic and diseased —possibly afflicted by the death curse—and to be sacrificing people to plant monsters in the jungle. He too was offered as a sacrifice alongside another prisoner, Siela . Although badly injured and trapped in brambles, he fought to escape from the twig and needle blights to which he had been offered, but his only hope for survival lay with adventurers who were also investigating the pterafolk.</p>
