<p>Griffon's Nest was a permanent settlement of the Griffon tribe of Uthgardt barbarians located in what was known as the Savage Frontier in northwest Faerûn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As of the mid-14 th century DR , the settlement comprised a score of wood-and-earth huts with thatched roofs that encircled the tribe's central longhouse and two warehouses. These structures were surrounded by a palisade of sturdy logs, often decorated with the heads of the tribes enemies. About a dozen outlying farms dotted the surrounding hillsides.</p>
<p>By the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , the village had prospered and grown to a small city of well over six thousand individuals. But after the death of its visionary leader, Chief Kralgar Bonesnapper , the settlement steadily declined, turned away from contact with outsiders, and was reduced to a hamlet of about three hundred people by the Year of the Iron Dwarf's Vengeance, 1485 DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The village was nestled in the Surbrin Hills northeast of Longsaddle . Farther to the east was Shining Creek .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Throughout the years the Griffon's Nest was overseen by the great chiefs of the Griffon tribe, several of which were of the Bonesnapper line.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The settlement was originally a bandit camp for a group of half-orcs led by a man named Azglyn . The Uthgardt attacked and wiped out the brigands and built their home on the site. Kralgar Bonesnapper became chief of the Griffon tribe in the Year of the Spur, 1348 DR , an by 1358 DR, Griffon's Nest was a thriving community that welcomed and traded with outsiders. Under his leadership, the tribe grew to be the most educated, skilled, and organized of all the Uthgardt peoples.</p>
<p>Chief Kralgar ambitiously wanted to conquer the great cities of the North , and allied with anyone that shared that goal. His policy of openness to trade had two sides: it brought prosperity to his tribe and helped him learn the weaknesses of his declared enemies to ensure victory when the time came. By 1372 DR, Griffon's Nest boasted almost seven thousand inhabitants and his tribe was on the path to war, but he had not picked a target for his horde yet. In his mind, possible conquests included Neverwinter , Everlund , or even Waterdeep . Alas, he fell in battle against the persistent orcs of the region and his grand plan never came to fruition.</p>
<p>Kralgar's descendants did not match their patriarch in wisdom, charisma, or vision and the settlement gradually dwindled over the decades. By 1485 DR, Kralgar's great-grandson Halric lived like a king but presided over a hamlet of perhaps three hundred tribesfolk that lived in poverty. The policies of openness and trade were abandoned to hostility and petty (but bold) raids on homesteaders in the Dessarin Valley just to prove to the doubters that the Bonesnapper family had not lost the divine favor of Uthgar .</p>
