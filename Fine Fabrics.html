<h2>Services</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gerard Densim , the proprietor of Fine Fabrics, did business with the Guild , paid for the organization's thugs to stand guard over the shop, protecting it from the dreaded Stone Lord , a new kingpin allied with the Cult of the Absolute . As the guild war grew more severe, The Guild Bursar Uktar raised the protection tithes. If unpaid, the guard would be withdrawn from Fine Fabrics. Gerard wrote a politely pleading letter stating he could not afford the guard to be removed and asked if it would be a good compromise for the Guild to accept a letter of credit from Fine Fabrics in addition to a twenty-percent discount for the Guild's guard (so they could look presentable while standing guard) and a fifty-percent discount to the guildmaster Nine-Fingers Keene , the city's fifth and unforgotten duke.</p>
