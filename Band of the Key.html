<p>The Band of the Key was a band of dedicated occultist fighters who operated in Faer√ªn sometime before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some years before the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , the infamous Band of the Key was led by a lanky man named Heglyf . They hunted down books of evil arcane knowledge and removed them from the hands of those who might misuse such items. As Heglyf's group preferred to strike from the shadows using crossbows , he commissioned the creation of brightly-decorated enchanted tranquil bolts from Deneirian priests .</p>
