<p>Pharaxes Zora was a cleric of Bane who was stationed in Elmwood during the Rage of Dragons of 1373 DR , in an attempt to conquer it for the Zhentarim . He was slain by Pavel Shemov 's party.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Barrel-chested, Pharaxes' uncombed, greasy hair and stained clothing made him resemble a violent ruffian more than a priest.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Pharaxes got a cynical thrill out of lying to people he perceived as unable to respond. He was quick to resort to insults, and swift to punish perceived disobedience.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Pharaxes entered into a spell duel with Pavel Shemov.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>In addition to his armor, his holy symbol of Bane and a morningstar, Pharaxes carried a ring of magic detection , which he used to determine that Karasendrieth was probably concealing some possessions from them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Officially a "customs agent" in Elmwood, Pharaxes was part of a very official-sounding scheme to rob every traveler on behalf of an alliance around the Moonsea to fight the Rage of Dragons . The alliance, yet to materialize, had Zhentil Keep at its head and had granted itself the right to arbitrarily tax travelers passing through Elmwood.</p>
<p>He was also the captain of a warship, the Dagger , out of Yulash .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Pharaxes was slain in Tarsakh 11 , while in a spell duel against Pavel Shemov that started after his party attacked him in protection of Karasendrieth 's possessions, which they expected would be confiscated by the customs agent.</p>
