<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures had very gaunt bodies that terminated in a long tail, which was flat and bristling with spikes.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These creatures preferred to lurk in the shadows, striking their foes when they least expected it. They would then attempt to flee before their opponent could have an opportunity to retaliate and hide once more to repeat the process.</p>
<p>When fighting in dim light, or preferably complete darkness, shadowhunter bats tended to fight more fiercely.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Following an earthquake caused by the Spellplague , a rift opened up in the first level of Undermountain and shadowhunter bats quickly took to the area as a lair.</p>
