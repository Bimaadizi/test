<p>Sikak , also called the City of Coins , was one of the rich Pearl Cities of west Zakhara .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Sikak was found along the coast of the Golden Gulf in the northern reaches of the Pearl Cities. The city lay along the banks of al-Nuhas River near the Bountiful Shoals and Maribar Island .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Fate blessed Sikak with a series of naturally-occurring artesian wells, providing most of the city's drinking water. The wells began to fail in the early 14 th century DR , but the leaders of Sikak negotiated aid from the dao and marid who solved the problem.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Sikak's population in 1367 DR was 60,000. Each inhabitant of the City of Coins was somehow tied to the sea. As fishermen, the Sikaki were somewhat sensitive about the source of their wealth compared to mighty Gana and Jumlat whose wealth revolved around pearl diving. To insult a single Sikaki was to insult their entire family, boat, and the city as a whole.</p>
<p>Sultan Magar al-Azim ruled Sikak in 1367 DR.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>The metropolis gained its wealth from its famous fishing industry generated from the coastal waters next to the city and nearby Maribar Island that teemed with all kinds of different fish. Sikak took its symbolic sobriquet "City of Coins" from the bigger fish's scales that resembled silver coins.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>Sikak supported a city guard of 2,000 soldiers. Additional forces included 3,000 mercenary barbarians , 500 cavalry, and an imperial palace guard of 200 ogres . Sikak's navy included 20 ships with 400 highly trained marines specializing in ship combat. Most of Sikak's naval vessels were smaller ships meant for shore patrol.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Shipwrecks were found on the far side of Maribar Island containing the skeletons of many gnomes . Prince Jeygar al-Azim was tasked with investigating the matter.</p>
