<p>Delenia "Delly" Curtie a barmaid at The Cutlass tavern in Luskan and later the wife of Wulfgar , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Delly Curtie was a girl with blonde-brown hair that did not look very clean. Her eyes were a rare shade of light brown and her grin was slightly crooked.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Delly had a typically sarcastic attitude.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>In Luskan, she had intimate relationships with a variety of men, including Morik the Rogue . She was somewhat promiscuous seeking the knowledge, safety and security of the menfolk she spent her time with and seeing relations with these men as a fair trade for her security. Finally though, she settled with Wulfgar and left Luskan.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>By the age of 20 in 1364 DR , she had worked for Arumn Gardpeck in his tavern The Cutlass in Luskan for several years.</p>
<h3>Travels with Wulfgar</h3>
<p>Delly's fortunes changed when Wulfgar came to the tavern that year. He broke most of it, but she came to admire and love him. She was there throughout the times that he was away in Auckney but when he came back to see her in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR , after he'd adopted Colson , she came with him and Morik to help take care of the child, The child's natural parents were Meralda Feringal and Jaka Sculi but Delly still cared for the girl.</p>
<p>She cared for the child for some time, helping Wulfgar and allowing him to find himself and to turn from the darkness behind him. Late in 1366 DR, she cared for Colson whilst Wulfgar set out on the Sea Sprite to track down Aegis-fang . She stayed at the house of Captain Deudermont, trying her best to learn to be a lady from some expectation others have of her.</p>
<h3>At Mithral Hall</h3>
<p>She went with Wulfgar whenever she could, but during adventure or war, she was often left behind in Mithral Hall . The last time, however, came at the cost of her life and happiness. She longed to be back under the open sky and, on such occasion during the war with the Many-Arrows orcs over 1370 DR to 1371 DR , tried unsuccessfully to ask Wulfgar to go with her to Silverymoon . Wulfgar didn't appreciate what strain she felt in the subterranean conditions of Mithral Hall and failed to see how desperate she was, not least considering the greater time he spent with his former love Catti-brie . She started trying to get away and listened to the other refugees in Mithral Hall talk of starting new lives in a variety of cities. She went to visit Catti-brie with Colson, but came under the influence of the intelligent sword Khazid'hea .</p>
<p>Khazid'hea, thirsty for blood, forced Delly to hand her daughter Colson over to Cottie Cooperson and travel north behind the enemy orc lines. After traversing many miles, Delly came across an orc band and, being completely controlled by Khazid'hea, ran headlong into battle with the group. She slew one immediately and another soon, but fell to the arrows of an orc archer. She died watching the Sel√ªne pass overhead in the night sky. She dropped Khazid'hea, which was claimed by other wielders.</p>
<h3>Legacy</h3>
<p>The reincarnated Catti-brie used the alias "Delly Curtie" in Longsaddle and Icewind Dale in the 1480s DR.</p>
