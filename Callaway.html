<p>Callaway was a hard-working older human farmer who lived in Gillian's Hill , a small hamlet along the Trade Way circa 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Callaway was a hardy worker who spent most of his life under the sun, evidently from his tanned skin. He had a weather-beaten face, gray hair, and bushy sideburns. He tended to talk in a caustic manner as he preferred to work, leaving little time for oratory practice. He also was very superstitious, refusing to talk about strange goings-on or even diseases that plagued the town in 1372 DR. He swished anyone who asked about such things to protect the young ones from such "evil talk."</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1372 DR, Callaway could be found tending vegetable fiends and cows just outside Torleth's Treasures . He often told strangers off, assuming them to be traveling salesmen.</p>
<p>During the time Gillian's Hill was affected by a strange vampirism -like plague, the Hero of Daggerford was asked to investigate the disease. When the adventurers arrived in the hamlet, they met Callaway, asking him about Mabda , a local mad hermit who was thought to have some information on the plague's origins. Callaway thought the old healer woman to be a complete loon, nevertheless helped the heroes to her tent on the edge of Gillian's Hill.</p>
