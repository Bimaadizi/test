<p>Flutter blades were commonplace, one-handed melee weapons of the Underdark primarily associated with the slyth . They were exotic weapons with serrated blades able to land critically devastating blows, and particularly notable for the center-mounted hinge and handle with which they could be folded. A folded flutter blade was used to pierce while an unfolded one was used to slash.</p>
