<p>The Cave of Tranquil Peace was a hall found within the Horseshoe Temple Oasis in the Quoya Desert of the Hordelands during the mid 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Cave of Tranquil Peace was located in the far right side of upper galleries level of the temple. It was connected to the Halls of Life and Death . The Hall was quite long at 85 feet (26 meters) with several small alcoves branching from its sides.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The hall was rarely used when the temple was fully operational as its purpose was to store the bones of abbots who died within the temple. Each set of bones was carefully placed within its own niche in the cave walls.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Unlike the rest of the Temple, the hall remained empty as of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR . The occupying oni feared entering the Cave of Tranquil Peace because of the power they believed the dead abbots wielded. The oni painted protective charms to Li Pei in the other halls connecting here.</p>
