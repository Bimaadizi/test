<p>Evonne Linden was a royal-born daughter of the Tethyrian Rhindaun Dynasty who orchestrated a series of plots to seize power in her kingdom during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In her youth, Evonne wore her blonde hair ringlets. She said to have a smile that evoked the likeness of a fiend.</p>
<p>She had a series of unique, branching scars that extended from her hand up her arm.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Evonne was brilliant and determined, if not calculating and manipulative woman. She had a seemingly near-infinite amount of patience to see her plans to fruition. For a time Evonne became fascinated with the macabre, possibly due to her own profound fear of her own death.</p>
<p>She also had a singular hatred of elves , particularly those lead by Avalor , Treespeaker of the Wealdath .</p>
<p>Her favorite colors were red and gold.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Evonne had a keen eye for politics and was more than capable of out-maneuvering some of the most conniving minds of Tethyr.</p>
<p>She was also a skilled spellcaster , and studied all manner of dark and esoteric magic. She was particularly interested in the magic of the ancient sarrukh , who were known to consume the flesh of "lesser" intelligent species. To better understand the sarrukh's secrets―and perhaps overcome the inconvenience of mortality.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Through her studies into the arcane, Evonne's developed techniques to manipulate the 'miniscule building blocks' that made up the fabric of existence, that led her to create clones of other people using their blood .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Evonne married an influential Tethyrian named Garion Linden . Garion had a devoted following, who offered their allegiance to Evonne after his untimely death. Together they had two children, Teague and Ysabel .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>During her sister's reign, Evonne made a failed attempt to seize the throne of Tethyr for herself.</p>
<p>In the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR , elves from the Wealdath slaughtered many Tethyrian nobles, including Evonne's son Teague, at a gathering at the Winter Palace , in what came to be known as the Children's Massacre . Evonne and Anais were en route to the palace, but were waylaid in Celleu due to a sudden and unnatural fog. Unfortunately, Evonne was still killed that night, targeted a group of assassins in what was declared by the Tethyrian Inquiry as a profound irony.</p>
<p>Following her apparent death, Evonne's followers took to calling themselves the Branch of Linden . They attempted to continue their lady's quest to reclaim the throne from Queen Anais, but were ultimately routed by the Tethyrian military.</p>
<p>Evonne Linden did not die however. Her consciousness was transferred into the body of her daughter Ysabel, who was one of three survivors of the Children's Massacre. It was not entirely clear how exactly Evonne transferred herself into her daughter's body, save for the fact it occurred on the same night as the massacre.</p>
<p>Evonne then spent the next decade living as her daughter. Ysabel was named the ward of her son's former tutor, Tresco Maynard , who readily accepted the late Evonne's tremendous wealth. While it appeared that Ysabel began her arcane studies under Tresco, it was in fact Evonne that fed the tutor ancient lore taken from her years of study. It was that arcane knowledge that allowed Tresco to conduct horrific magical experiments on the prisoners of the Vankila Slab prison. His contributions were but a mere, trifling addition to everything Evonne had previously achieved before.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , Evonne manipulated Tresco and the one-time "Hero of the Realm" Declan Cardew into launching an expedition to the ruined Sarrukh city of Hisari in Chult. She enticed them with the political power of Tethyr, allowing the duo to plot a coup against Queen Anais by means of Cardew's marriage to "Ysabel", with Tresco Maynard serving as the true ruler of the realm. Evonne manipulated them into retrieving an elixir made from the blood of a being known as " the Captive ". While Cardew and Tresco managed to enter into the lost city, they ultimately stole the wrong artifact.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a group of adventurers hired by Evonne's Avalor of the Wealdath arrived at Tresco's estate to 'save' Ysabel from marrying the lecherous Cardew. Seeing her opportunity, Evonne quickly manipulated the adventurers into serving her instead.</p>
