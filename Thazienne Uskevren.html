<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Thazienne's right wrist was scarred by a dog attack that happened when she was a child. She kept the wound a secret until it got infected. Her mother, Shamur Uskevren , asked the healer to leave the scar as a reminder of Tazi's foolishness.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , she received a mark of Szass Tam on her left shoulder, the symbol of interlocking arms, one human and one skeletal. The mark bore magic that gave Tazi the ability to lead an army of juju zombies . The magic tattoo was damaged in the following battle with Eltab and remained on her faded to almost a smudge.</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Thazienne was naturally apt at breaking in wild horses . She joined her brothers in taming wild beasts, common practice among Sembian nobility, as soon as she was old enough to ride a steed.</p>
<p>For a period of time, Thazienne's abilities were enhanced for her to seize control of an army of blooded ones . She survived the ritual that increased her strength, agility, given her somewhat feral rage, and granted her innate knowledge of the orcish language.</p>
