<p>The Black Wolf tribe was a clan of hobgoblins active in the southern reaches of the Giantspire Mountains and in the Dunwood .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The clan maintained a close alliance with the worgs of the Dunwood.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR , the Black Wolf clan was one of the only tribes which could successfully resist the expansionism of the Razor Heart tribe throughout the Giantspires. This was largely thanks to their ability to fall back to the Dunwood and their worg allies within, as well as to the fact that their chieftan possessed a Crown of Whispers , one of a pair of magic items which imbued the wearer with great charisma. The other Crown lay in the hands of the Razor Heart queen, Maaqua .</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The chieftan of the Black Wolf clan was Aruugan in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR . While it was a clan of hobgoblins, they like many of the mightier goblinoid tribes of the Giantspires counted ogres and giants among their ranks.</p>
