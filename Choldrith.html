<p>Choldriths were the priest race of the chitines in the Underdark .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Choldriths had eight slender legs (although the front two served as arms) and resembled bloated white spiders about 9 feet (2.7 meters) in diameter. Their faces resembled those of chitines, with some humanoid features, faceted eyes, and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Their ears looked like horns.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>When possible, choldriths used their chitine subordinates as fodder to shield them in battle while they used their clerical spells .</p>
<p>They could spin webs like a spider, and could throw out net-like webs to ensnare foes up to 50 feet (15 meters) away. Also like a spider, their bite was highly venomous.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>Choldriths were priests and spellcasters. They lived alongside chitines in villages inside caverns filled with maze-like webs. In the center of the cavern was always a temple to Lolth . Choldriths served as the leaders of each village, as they were seen as blessed by Lolth.</p>
<p>Choldriths were found alongside chitines in the upper and middle - Northdark . However, the majority lived in several connected villages known cumulatively as Yathchol, located beneath the Far Forest . In that city, choldriths made up 8 percent of the population in 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Choldriths were said to have been created by Lolth herself. It was believed that transformation into a choldrith was a kind of twisted reward bestowed by the Spider Queen on those who passed her tests, not unlike how transformation into a drider was a punishment for failing her tests.</p>
