<p>Flux slaads were an uncommon variety of slaadi that emerged in the Elemental Chaos following the Spellplague . They were generally smaller and weaker than other varieties of slaadi, garnering them little respect among their peers.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A flux slaad completely lacked any sense of self-awareness or self-preservation. Their actions were blindly motivated by a desire to cause chaos and carnage, often beset by unpredictable and violent rages.</p>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>Unlike other slaadi, a flux slaad lacked the ability to reproduce. They could teleport short distances and could see in areas of low light . Their monikor of "flux" derived from their resistances and vulnerabilites towards various elements and elemental energies always being in a state of flux, such as cold, fire , lighting, psionic energy , necrotic energy , and sound. Whenever they were injured by one of these, they would become resistant to it and something else would in-turn becoming its vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>These slaadi solely fought with the use of their claws.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>A flux slaad occasionally slipped by accident through portals , commonly ending up near gatherings of bullywugs . They would often make themselves revered rulers over the bullywugs and showed great restraint in harming their subjects.</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>Flux slaads spoke both Common and Primordial .</p>
