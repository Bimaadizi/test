<h2>History</h2>
<p>During the assassination of Seszgar Huntcrown by two blueflame ghosts , Dralkin called for Swordcaptain Tannath , who arrived in the aftermath of the slaying. He informed Tannath of what they'd been able to determine in the meantime. Dralkin was also the one who investigated the murder of Gaskur . He had some difficulties keeping two onlookers, the dancer Amarune Whitewave , and the nobleman Arclath Delcastle , from peeping at the body.</p>
<p>Swordcaptain Dralkin later reported to Glathra Barcantle that three noblemen had been looking frantically for a "largish hand axe ". They finally were able to pursue those noblemen, Delasko Sornstern , Broryn Windstag , and Kathkote Dawntard , until the wayward heirs were magically transported out of reach.</p>
