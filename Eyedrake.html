<p>Eyedrakes were the result of a beholder dreaming of a dragon .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Eyedrakes vaguely resembled a draconic creature, but lacked true limbsâ€”the wings were formed of multiple eyestalks, and another large eye was located inside of the perpetually open mouth.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Eyedrakes on their own exhibited behaviors similar to those of young dragons, such as establishing a lair and hoard. They fought to the death to defend their hoard, refusing to relinquish even the smallest bauble.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Eyedrakes had the magic eye-rays of beholders: the eye in the mouth emitted the antimagic cone and the wing-eyestalks unleashed, variously, a freezing ray, a repulsion ray, a fire ray, a paralysis-inducing ray, and a necrotizing ray.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Sometimes, when a beholder had to compete against a dragon for wealth or territory, it grew obsessed with its draconic rival to the point that its obsession pervaded its dreams; if the obsession lasted long enough, the fevered dreams lead to the creation of an eyedrake.</p>
<p>Because of their peculiar nature, eyedrakes required neither food nor drink.</p>
