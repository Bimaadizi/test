<p>Waukeen's Circle was a stone circle and market in the middle of Trademeet in Amn .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Circle was a ring of seven rounded stone slabs set on their edges used as a marketplace in the town. It was held to be a holy site of Waukeen , and believed to enforce the Merchant's Peace of Trademeet. A merchant who broke the accord was believed to die horribly, or at least Waukeen's displeasure would be noted by one of the stones cracking.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The stone circle was originally used as a caravan stop, leading to the founding of Trademeet in 223 DR .</p>
<p>It was believed that Waukeen herself manifested in the Circle on the Shieldmeet of 920 DR . She was outraged to find that the market was filled with lying merchants, inferior goods, and dishonest deals. She turned the High Merchant's hands to gold and divvied up the fingers to the wronged parties (inspiring the Amnian curse " Delosar 's fingers!") and declared the Merchant's Peace, with the result that Trademeet was the most honest and fair caravan stop and market in Amn.</p>
