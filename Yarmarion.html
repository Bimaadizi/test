<p>Yarmarion was an elderly wood elf in the town of Relkath's Foot in Aglarond in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the town in the Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR , he met Raidon Kane , while smoking a pipe. He examined Raidon's keepsake of his mother, and though he failed to recognize its primary symbol, he did recognize some of the inscriptions around it as belonging to a dead tongue. He matched those symbols to some he saw in a library of Mystra near Calimport , before the agents of the Temple of Old Night burned it to the ground. According to Yarmarion, the book that contained such text was about how the first mortals had sleep stolen from them so that they might never know the horror of dreams. He also observed that powerful magic was bound in the amulet. He also explained the Masters of the Yuirwood to Raidon.</p>
