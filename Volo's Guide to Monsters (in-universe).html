<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The book contained information on numerous monsters, from the wilderness to the Underdark . Volo claimed to have personally researched the information related on its pages, either by conducting concealed observation or by consulting with entities such as the guardian spirits of tombs.

<h2>History</h2>
<p>After publishing the book, Volo traveled to Port Nyanzaru , where he visited several taverns to promote his work. He sold signed copies to the merchant princes and to adventurers for 50 gp .</p>
<p>After finishing his book tour, Volo returned to Waterdeep , where he ran into financial difficulties while he waited for royalty payments from Volo's Guide to Monsters . In order to offset his debt, Volo began working on his next book, Volo's Guide to Spirits and Specters .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>The book proved to be quite popular across the Realms , notably with nobles and thrill-seekers from places like Waterdeep, Neverwinter , and Baldur's Gate . Some sought to "follow in his footsteps" and visit some of the locations described in the book, leading to an influx of tourists to places like Phandalin.</p>
<p>Annotations by Elminster Aumar found on some copies of the book implied that some of the dangers involved in the field research conducted by Volo were attenuated by Elminster himself informing some monsters of the foul taste of Volothamps.</p>
