<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-12 th century DR , after Volkumburgh Vale was sacked by the rampage of the devil -possessed stone golem known as Awtawmatawn , the village's Lord Volkumburgh hid his treasure beneath what would become the Crimson Wyrm. A narrow passageway connected its concealed cavern to a trapdoor beneath the village's fountain. This treasure was known to the inhabitants of Volkumburgh village, though its location was not, and over time it would come to be known as "Volki's treasure."</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , a man named Lychor took up lodgings in the inn to keep an eye on Amelior Amanitas 's efforts to reconstruct the golem and made duplicates of all his notes and plans. His imp familiar Anabis guarded his rented room.</p>
<p>In the month of Uktar , some time before the Feast of the Moon , a group of adventurers from Suzail would arrive, seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior. When they came to the Crimson Wyrm its proprietor served them a free round of hot cider. They would rent themselves rooms and stay to easedrop on the local gossip.</p>
<p>Eventually, those adventurers managed to help Amelior re-assemble Awtawmatawn. And once finally awakened it began to rampage around Volkumburg. With magic items provided to them by Amelior, the Suzailian adventurers managed to defeat the golem and it fell upon the Crimson Wyrm. Destroying it and revealing a hidden cave underneath that contained Lord Volkumburgh's fabled treasure.</p>
