<p>The Golden Gauntlets were a group of adventurers who operated circa 1369 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , the Golden Gauntlets attended a party hosted by Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail . The occasion was King Azoun Obarskyr IV 's birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.</p>
<p>After the festivities, it appeared that Lord Thistle had been murdered, but Ruben's word as a paladin of Tyr was sufficient for them to avoid immediate suspicion.</p>
