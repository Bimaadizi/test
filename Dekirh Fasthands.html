<p>Dekirh Fasthands was a jester - bard who performed in the rowdiest taverns across the Sword Coast some years before the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Dekirh insisted on doing his shows across the worst of the taverns of the Sword Coast, his friends gifted him with a set of enchanted chainmail , in hopes that the armor would protect him from the things patrons threw at Dekirh: rotten produce and knives . To wear Jester's Chain on stage, Dekirh Fasthands painted the chainmail in bright jesterly colors of reds, blues, and golds . Dekirh's final fate remained unrecorded, however, Jester's Chain eventually left his posession, ending up in Athkatla in Amn in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , and later, in Thay .</p>
