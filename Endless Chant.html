<p>The Endless Chant was a recitation that was continually repeated by a select few monks of the Avowed . It echoed through the courtyard of Candlekeep throughout all hours of the day. It covered all of the prophecies of the famous seer Alaundo , who inscribed his visions in the keep during the 1 st century DR .</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>It was performed in a resounding yet monotone voice, in a procession that filled the Court of Air with the words of Alaundo. The chant was led by a member of the Avowed known as The Chanter, who was assisted by three others, the Voices of the North, East, and South.</p>
<p>The chant was not truly "endless". As time went on, more and more of the prophecies came true and were removed from the monks' recitation.</p>
