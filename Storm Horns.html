<p>The Storm Horns , also referred to as the Stormhorns or Storm Horn Mountains , was the name given to the mountains that marked the western and northern frontier of Cormyr in the Eastern Heartlands . They were wild and untamed peaks, the cliffs and crags of which were teeming with a wide variety of monsters.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Storm Horns were among the tallest and steepest mountains in central Faerûn , composed of hardened rock that was more difficult than most to break through. They were exceptionally difficult to traverse and those attempting a trek across the jagged terrain were in for a grueling trip.</p>
<p>The highest of the Storm Horns' peaks stood far above the others, piercing the clouds in the sky. While it was a stunning view to behold, the treacherousness of the mountainside made it one best appreciated from afar.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>As its name suggested, the Storm Horns were battered with horrific thunderstorms all year round. The eastern slopes of the mountains were battered with most of the rain as wind nearly always blew westward, and the highest peaks received snowfall much of the year save for summer.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The mountains formed the northwest border of Cormyr, segregating the Forest Nation from the desert of Anauroch in north Faerûn .</p>
<p>Only two pathways wound through the range, High Horn Pass and Gnoll Pass , both of which were defended by Cormyr.</p>
<h3>Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>The majority of plant life found in the Storm Horns grew along its eastern slopes. Turis trees could be found at the upper end of the treeline, along with the ubiquitous Bowen's flower , and bentilan spice. Maxor plants could be found to the south, only near the Tun River .</p>
<p>A wide variety of mammalian animals made their home throughout the Storm Horns, including deer , bears , mountain lions , wolves , and the rather uncommon serow . Some of the more monstrous or fantastic beasts found within included kobolds , aurumvoraxes , rocs , minotaur lizards , and in the deepest of its caves, the vicious chimerae .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>These mountains were once home to several strongholds of an ancient goblin empire. The empire fell to dwarven attacks, long before humans appeared in Cormyr .</p>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , the tribes of the Storm Horns occasionally launched raids, although some had learned to trade peacefully. While range's human settlements had to be deserted during the Goblin War of 1370 DR , both Eagle Peak and Skull Crag remained standing and populated the year after the war's end .</p>
<p>When the extra-dimensional city of Grodd was drawn closer to the Prime Material Plane around that same time, portals to the city began to form within the range.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Due to their majestic size the mountains inspired numerous writers to recount their grandeur in poetic verse.</p>
<p>Circa the mid–14 th century DR, there was a false rumor that scores of drow , liches , and beholders came up from the Storm Horns and surrounding areas.</p>
