<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He had a twin brother Parys , who was a also a spellcaster in the same adventuring company.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR , Bartholeme and rest of the Company of the Lynx recovered a collection of magically sealed pouches among the remains of a dead dragon near the Wyvernwater . The Guin brothers refused to use their magic to open the pouches, believing them to be old and dangerous in nature.</p>
<p>Rather than press Bartholeme and Parys, the company's leader Knorrel Talbot hired the lone spellcaster Midnight to complete the deed. When she removed the arcane protections from the pouches, Talbot hid the fact they contained scrolls bearing the true names of a great many Red Wizards of Thay . When Midnight used a clairaudience spell to learn this secret and fled into the night, Talbot ordered the twins along with the rest of the company to take her down.</p>
<p>Bartholeme Guin and all but one member of the Company of the Lynx died that night in a conflagration of blue fire. Only Midnight survived.</p>
