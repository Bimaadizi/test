<p>Sarsson was a type of plant native to wet tropical regions and warm volcanic subterranean areas.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sarsson was a common but little-known herb. It grew in fine carpets close to the ground, and its leaves were broad, short, and yellow. It was most commonly found in hot jungles, tropical riverbanks, warm bogs, and underground, nearby hot volcanic vents underground. It had a distinct peppery - lemony taste.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The strong taste of sarsson could be used to make foul water better tasting. However, it only affected its palatability but not food safety. As a seasoning, sarsson was used to complement meats. Certain species of carrion birds and related creatures, like giant striders and gorcraws found sarsson irresistible when mixed with fresh blood as it brought forth a vivid, strong taste beloved by them. because of that, sarsson was used in fire newt society as part of execution for murder. Fire newts found guilty were tortured for three days, their body parts removed, and treated with sarsson. The guilty individual was then fed alive to their own mount.</p>
