<p>Breaths of the Maiden were mysterious enchanted shortswords found on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These swords had a distinct bold design and marks indicating their maker or origins.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>Truly mysterious weapons, Breaths of the Maiden were all believed to have originated from the same source, judging by markings left on each of these blades. Despite the markings being boldly displayed, sages were at a loss when researching their meaning. Not a single known wielder of a Breath of the Maiden knew or offered any insight on the weapon's origins nor disclosed how they came to possess such a strange item.</p>
<p>In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , one such blade was in the hands of one of Lord Temar 's men stationed in his estate in Neverwinter 's Blacklake District . Another sword belonged to King Karagg , the leader of fire giants who inhabited caves within Mount Hotenow the same year.</p>
