<p>A blightspawned creature was affected by the supernatural blight brought forth by the Rotting Man .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>While at first almost normal, the blightspawned slowly blackened, clotted with oozing sores, found their bodily fluids becoming black and oily. Eventually their eyes sank in to become black pits animated with green, malevolent luminescence. Life would eventually desert them completely as they turned undead.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Granted horrid vitality and frightful strength by their condition, the blightspawned were also immune to anything that plants could endure, though dimmed somewhat. Within months, their condition progressed into complete undeath, turning them into juju zombies .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Blightspawned creatures loathed anything clean and whole, seeking to spread their horrid poison for the Rotting Man. They never attacked blightlords unless attacked first, save for the most absolute neophytes to their ranks.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The blightspawned carried a terrible supernatural disease that could not be healed by normal means. Animals or plants that succumbed to it wouldd become blightspawned themselves.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>By 1372 DR , the blightspawned were central to the forces of the Rotting Man, and servants to many blightlords. They protected Dun-Tharos for them and they had been part of the force that leveled Denderdale . Their presence in the Rawlinswood had also made it a dangerous proposition to trap animals or log for wood there.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR , a force of blighted volodni attacked Fullpoint in search of Araluen , bringing a blightspawned dire lion with them. More of the blighted numbered amongst the forces of the blightlord Gameliel in the Mucklestones and amongst the personal guard of the Rotting Man in The Close .</p>
