<p>Jan Jo's tea kettle was an enchanted silver kettle that could brew three different types of curative teas depending upon what was boiled inside of it.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If just plain water was boiled within the kettle, it would come out as a mint -flavored tea that relieved imbibers of all fatigue and tiredness.</p>
<p>Once per day, if actual mint leaves were boiled in the water alongside honey , the kettle would produce one to four cups of tea that had the same effect as a potion of healing . However, this tea had to be consumed very soon after being poured in order for the effect to take place.</p>
<p>Finally, if belladonna was boiled in water within Jan Joâ€™s tea kettle , the resulting tea had the effect of fully curing an imbiber of lycanthropy . However, for those with a poor constitution, imbibing the tea could cause such a drastic shock to the lycanthrope 's physical systems as to result in death. This fatal outcome was of little concern to the tea kettle's creator, as their guarantee was that the kettle would ultimately cure lycanthropy "one way or another".</p>
