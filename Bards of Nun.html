<p>The Bards of Nun was given to the trio of bards who participated in the Rotting Wars of Chondath , each with the opposing armies of Arrabar , Reth , and Hlath .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Bards of Nun participated in the conflict and recorded the events for posterity independent from each other. Most notably, the bards' chronicles included a rare appearance of a divine being. Independently from each other, the Bards of Nun recorded the appearance of the Lord of Battles – Tempus upon the Fields of Nun . The avatar, or possibly a vision, manifested himself before the infamous historic Battle of Nun . The deity rode on a skeletal steed that exuded blood dripping over the future battlefield. Each of the three armies' generals took Tempus' presence as a good omen, seeing the Lord of Battles atop a white stallion.</p>
