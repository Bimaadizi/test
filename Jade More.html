<p>Jade More was a talented thief of the mid–14 th century DR . She was a more a larcenous version of Alias , with loose morals and a wicked sense of humor. She befriended Olive Ruskettle , whom she worked with for several months before being killed by Flattery Wyvernspur for stealing his purse—he thought that she was his own version of Alias, Cat .</p>
