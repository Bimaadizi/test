<p>Tartyron , also titled the Lord of Chaos , was the name adopted by a ruler and member of the Circle of Order in the ancient past of the Utter East .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>He was once a member of the Circle of Order, a group of lords who arose to govern the early nations of the Utter East, those east of the Great Sea . He was a peer of the Lord of Lands , who ruled the Realm of Lands ; the Lady of Tides , who ruled the Realm of Tides ; and the Lord of Flame , who ruled the Realm of Fire ; they believed order brought progress. However, he came to believe that chaos brought challenge, change, and strength and thus engaged in chaotic plots. So the others of the Circle cast him out and bound him in a subterranean kingdom beneath the Realm of Fire, with the Lord of Flame as his warden.</p>
<p>In his imprisonment, he adopted the name "Tartyron" and was called the Lord of Chaos. Loathing this place, Tartyron constantly struggled against the wards, his rage bolstering his strength and spent on those who happened into his deep realm. He waited, knowing those of the Realms would grow comfortable, lazy, and weak, and then he would escape to spread chaos once again.</p>
<p>Finally, during the time of the Bloodforge Wars ( 648 – 657 DR ), the wards failed and Tartyron broke free of his subterranean prison and into the world above, free to spread chaos through the Realms of Lands, Tides, and Fire, in an event known as Tartyron Unbound .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tartyron habitually wore a suit of black full plate armor, with a ragged black cloak and a helm with a fanged skull-like face and horns.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Tartyron believed in the power of chaos, arguing that it created challenges and trials that strengthened people and brought worthwhile change.</p>
<h2>Prison</h2>
<p>Tartyron's prison realm lay underground, somewhere in the Utter East and close to the Realm of Flame. A portcullis barred entry to the tunnel out. It was accessed from the surface via tunnel sealed with a slab of stone amidst ancient runes, not far from a stone henge. It was once warded by inscribed sigils; if Tartyron was reinterred, these would be replaced with runes, but if not, it would be left in rubble.</p>
