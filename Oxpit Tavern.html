<p>The Oxpit Tavern was one of the most well-known, as well as the rowdiest, establishments in the city of Mulmaster during the 14 th and 15 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>It was located in near the west side of Mulmaster, within or near the city's Docks Quarter .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>There was little to note about the interior decoration of the tavern, a fact that did very little to take away from its tremendous popularity.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The tavern was a raucous place, where someone could just as readily get into a fistfight with their fellow patrons as they would in joining in a bawdy tavern song.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The Oxpit offered rooms for rent, at a cost of 7 gp per day, along with ample servings of roasted ox meat along with generously-poured mugs of ale .</p>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR , the Oxpit was run by Cyril , a friendly but exuberant man who was just as generous with information as he was with drink.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>While enjoying tremendous success circa the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR , the Oxpit tavern became the target of a spree of vandalism. After the tavern's owner Chroomeg requested the City Watch investigate the issue, at which they failed miserably, he hired on some mercenaries to act as tavern guards. The vandals were actually a number of giant badgers dug up through the tavern's cellar, under the influence of a cultist of the Black Earth . The druid of the Emerald Enclave Seranolla became trapped in the cellar investigating the matter, but was rescued by a band of adventurers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Branislav Semyon was a regular patron of the Oxpit tavern and used it as a meeting place for his assassination contracts.</p>
