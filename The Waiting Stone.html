<p>The Waiting Stone was a ryokan (inn) in Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar . It stood in the northern Mixed District. It was run by a woman known as a mama-san .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rooms were divided by shoji screens and were warmed by braziers on which aromatic woods were burned. Each had futon beds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In high summer of Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR) , a group of adventurers newly arrived in Aru were staying at The Waiting Stone. It was here, late at night, that a troop of samurai led by Tsukku woke and summoned them to a midnight meeting with the daimyo , Benju Matsutomo . The Waiting Stone would be their base throughout their activities in the town, with the monk Yaemon possibly sending them a message, messengers coming to them, and any blow-back from their investigations and associations potentially finding them here. On a later night, samurai once again woke and summoned the adventurers to a meeting, this time in secrecy with Benju's consort Naomi . At one point, their rooms may have been ransacked by a thief in black looking for valuables to steal; the mama-san saw the thief leave but thought it was just another odd visitor.</p>
