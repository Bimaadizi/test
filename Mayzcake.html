<p>Mayzcakes were flat but fluffy mayz bread staples of Maztican cuisine.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mayzcakes were made using a corse paste of crushed mayz and pepper , hand-patted and shaped into circles, then cooked over hearthfires. They were commonly served along with hot bubbling bean stew , venison , or even fruit. Most of these dishes could be taken on the road. The cakes were a simple recipe flavored with "some pepper," of course, the light flavor was mouth-scorching spiciness for those not accustomed to Maztican pallet.</p>
