<p>Quaraqand was a city in the Plain of Horses of northwestern Kara-Tur . It was the home of the Igidujin tribe.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The city stood deep in the southern Chigidi Mountains , leaving it quite isolated. A road ran to it from the northwest, though where this led is unknown.</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>The city was ruled by the cruel and despotic Qaland family. Circa Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , the qaghan of Quaraqand was Qaland T'akk , a man without mercy and bent on conquest.</p>
<h2>Law & Order</h2>
<p>Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Qaland T'akk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by T'akk himself.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>From Quaraqand, the Igidujin often raided the surrounding villages, nomad camps, and caravans, especially those of the Fankiang tribe, whom T'akk hated. Ostensibly, most of these raids were to steal Steppe horses but in truth it was largely to sate their bloodlust. They massacred their victims, leaving no man, woman, or child alive.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>The Igidujin favored clubs , both the war club known as chokhor modo and the throwing club called a sidam . Their commanders also employed hawks trained to attack targets.</p>
