<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Lady Regent Rowanmantle was elected to her position as Lady of Tilverton by the city's council of citizens, which she took the leadership of.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Alasalynn was the most prominent member of the Rowanmantle family and cousin of Shaerl Amcathra . She was served well by Cuthric Snow , a herald appointed to her by the Cormyrean court. She was on good terms with Barrit , a local scholar of Tilverton.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before becoming regent of the city, Alasalynn served as an officer within the Purple Dragons .</p>
<p>Shortly after Cormyr's annexation of Tilverton in 1357 DR , she was elected as Lady Regent, replacing the brief, heavy-handed, and unpopular rule of Duke Bhereu Ammaeth . She proved to be a much more popular ruler of the protectorate.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Lady Alasalynn attended King Azoun Obarskyr IV 's birthday feast, hosted by Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep . She was accompanied there by Lord Damaris Rowanmantle .</p>
<p>When the shades of Thultanthar returned to Faerûn in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR , it became apparent to Princess Alusair Obarskyr that they were a threat to all of Cormyr . On Mirtul 27 , Alusair toured Tilverton with her court mages Vangerdahast Aeiulvana and Caladnei , along with Lady Regent Rowanmantle and an elf from Evereska named Galaeron Nihmedu . As they came to believe Tilverton would be the first target of the Princes of Shade , Princess Alusair tasked the Lady Regent with the evacuation of her city.</p>
<p>Soon after, Vangerdahast let loose a powerful magical weapon upon the shade army, which ultimately resulted in the complete destruction of Tilverton. In the aftermath of the disaster, it appeared as if Lady Rowanmantle had been quite successful in getting her people safely out the city.</p>
