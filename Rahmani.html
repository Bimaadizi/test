<p>A rahmani was a Zakharan captain's book of naval charts.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Nearly as priceless as a daftar , this notebook contained maps, ocean charts, and landmarks useful for sailing the seas surrounding the Land of Fate. Annotations pointed out useful tips for most entries. These notebooks were never bought or sold, but shared when trust was well-established.</p>
