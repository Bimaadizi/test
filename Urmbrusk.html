<p>House Urmbrusk ( pronounced : /ˈ ɜːr m b r ʌ s k / URM-brusk ) was a noble family of Waterdeep since the mid-13 th century DR . They were known as land speculators and moneylenders.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>In 1368 DR , until at least 1372 DR , the head of the House was Halam Urmbrusk with his consort Anja and eldest son Chimak . By the 1460s DR, Quarren Urmbrusk was Lord and his son Rutherford was heir, but when the boy was still a teenager, Quarren gave his sister Lestra the reins of the family business empire and went off adventuring. Lestra was the effective head of the House until at least the early 1480s DR. In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Jelenn Urmbrusk was one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep , but it is unknown if she was also the head of House Urmbrusk.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Urmbrusks made their fortune dealing in real estate, owning many properties and also serving as an agent representing various merchants and temples that wanted to purchase a parcel of land. With their many assets, they also provided moneylending services.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Urmbrusk villa was located on a walled estate between the Street of the Singing Dolphin and the Street of Whispers in the Sea Ward . Diamond Street bordered the southern edge of their estate and the Ilzimmer family villa was just to the north.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Urmbrusk family was ennobled in the Year of Silent Steel, 1254 DR . They were of Illuskan descent and favored Bane as their patron deity . As of 1372 DR, there were 72 family members that could claim nobility. Around this time the family hosted the second annual Black Bucket Hunt . In the view of drunken and jaded nobles, it was a roaring success.</p>
<p>In 1492 DR, Jelenn Urmbrusk was one of the anonymous Lords of Waterdeep . She traded her influence with the Lords for financial assistance in getting out of debt as a result of some bad investments. She and possibly her House were beholden to the Zhentarim and ultimately Manshoon until the debts could be paid or the situation was resolved.</p>
