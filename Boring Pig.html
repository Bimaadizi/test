<p>The Boring Pig was a small tavern of little note in the city of Voonlar in the Moonsea region.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The tavern stood not far from the Bounty of the Goddess temple to Chauntea .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The interior of the tavern was an open space filled with a varied collection of tables, stools, chairs, and benches. Huge kegs of alcohol stood along one of the walls of the drinking establishment, with a single bar standing at the opposite wall from the entrance. A red-faced inebriated bartender dressed in a stained apron could always be seen serving the ale and joking with patrons.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the winter of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , Voonlar fell under a sudden fiendish attack by the Order of the Crippled Fang . One such fiend—a green slaad —broke through the Pig's barred doors and started trashing the place. Thankfully the drunks were saved by an unlikely hero: an undead rogue named Lyressa , who pounced on the creature's back and gave it a kiss of steel to all the patrons' rancorous approval.</p>
