<p>Naljier Skal was a human bard who had been sent to Spellhold to try and undo the damage that had been magically inflicted upon his mind.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Naljier Skal's full history is a mystery, but it was said that he was once a great bard of some repute. However, by 1369 DR , he had been magically afflicted, reducing his mind to that of a child's, which led to his subsequent incarceration in Spellhold. It is unknown when this damage was inflicted, or how; all that was known by the Cowled Wizards who took him into their care was that his last project had been into the nature of the universe and what lay beyond the gods , with the Spellhold Coordinator musing that something apparently didn't like him looking.</p>
<p>He was among the asylum inmates present in Spellhold when Gorion's Ward came to the institute in pursuit of Imoen and Jon Irenicus . Likewise, he was among the inmates who rallied behind the Bhaalspawn and their promise of vengeance against Irenicus' cruel experiments, only to perish in the ensuing battle.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Despite his shattered mind, Naljier was still able to access some kind of hidden pocket plane , where he had stashed a fortune in gemstones . However, because of his madness, he no longer recognized them for their monetary value, instead taking a childish comfort in "pretties". If spoken to with sufficient kindness, he would respond by withdrawing a gem from this stash and then giving it to the person who had been nice to him.</p>
<p>Naljier also retained his full spellcasting abilities, which combined with his child-like personality made him incredibly dangerous if unsupervised.</p>
