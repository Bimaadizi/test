<p>Hephaestus was a multispheric interloper deity of artisans, craftsmen, and smiths of the Olympian pantheon . His existence was known by a few on Toril , but overall he was rather obscure in the Realms.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was considered by some to be the only unattractive deity within his pantheon, due to having a club foot and hunchback. He bore a resemblance to hill giants and had a full beard. He stood roughly 20 ft (6.1 m) tall.</p>
<p>Hephaestus's avatar usually took the form of a muscular human male with shaggy, dark hair and untrimmed beards, with some kind of physical deformity.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Hephaestus was a very peaceful and generally benevolent deity, but this could be confounded by his sensitivity towards his deformity.</p>
<p>He highly valued and taught the virtues of hard labor, honesty and dependability. He emphasized loyalty to family and whomever else it was due — such as superiors, just rulers, and most of all elders. He encouraged his followers to tackle their problems with vigor and persistence.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Hephaestus was impervious to harm from fire . He could cast at will the spells could teleport without error and plane shift . His skills related to the working of metal and stone were incredible.</p>
<p>In addition to being capable of casting spells from the school of alteration , some of the many spells that Hephaestus knew included the following:</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>This deity typically wielded a 9 feet (2.7 meters) warhammer that had a +5 flaming burst enchantment .</p>
<h2>Realm</h2>
<p>Hephaestus lived and worked within a volcanic section of Mount Olympus , in the divine realm known as Olympus . This volcano was situated in an area where volcanic activity was quite common. His workshop had animated chairs and tables.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After she had discovered that Zeus was having multiple affairs, his wife Hera created Hephaestus wholly from her body. When Zeus discovered this, the god was so furious at her insolence that he hurled Hephaestus down on to the Prime Material plane , where he impacted so terribly that his body was injured, giving him a clubfoot and hunchback. Some time later he reconciled with Zeus and became a welcomed member of their pantheon.</p>
<p>Hephaestus went on to marry the Olympian goddess Aphrodite under the order of their fellow gods, who reasoned that the two of them needed divine consorts. When Hephaestus later discovered that she was vying for the Olympian known as Ares , he fashioned and entrapped them within a net. Then he invited their fellow Olympian gods over to mock them.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Hephaestus spent much of his time crafting armor, structures, tools, and weaponry for the other deities within his pantheon. This included forging the thunderbolts that Zeus would hurl at his enemies. His most preferred metal to work with was adamantine , as he worked best with extremely hard metals.</p>
<p>His avatars were often sent to observe volcanic eruptions and witness or assist in epic feats of smithing.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Hephaestus had many cyclopes that lived inside his volcanic mountain home with him, assisting in his craftsmen activities. They were a gift to him from his mother and were far more intelligent than the standard cyclopes. Other creatures that lived with him as helpers included efreeti and fire elementals . In addition, the tunnel entrance to his lair was guarded by a red dragon .</p>
<p>He was one of the closest allies of the dwarven deity Dumathoin and was supplied by him with adamantine ore. The gnomish deity Nebelun occasionally visited him, offering advice and help, and at times they created incredible items together. Some claimed that Hephaestus had an ongoing rivalry with other deities who had the forge in their portfolios, but little was known about it. And Goibhniu , the Celtic deity of blacksmithing, often compared notes and skills with Hephaestus.</p>
<p>Although he was married to Aphrodite, Hephaestus had affection for Athena , but she either didn't notice or chose to show ignorance.</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Hephaestus had very few followers, some of which included dwarves . His followers were typically artisans, craftsmen, and smiths. Because he had so few worshipers he sought to treat them very well, often crafting them gifts in the form of adamantine armor, shields, and weapons with a +5 enchantment .</p>
<p>The priests of his faith typically wielded hammers as weapons and wore a leather apron as part of their priestly vestments. They were often skilled in creating and repairing magical armor and weapons. In their temple smithies they worked alongside the worshipers of Hephaestus, encouraging finer production, offering or receiving training, and developing new forging techniques. When not working at their forges his priests were charged with maintaining civic life, performing a wide range of public ceremonies.</p>
<p>Before anyone was accepted into his clergy, Hephaestus would send his avatar to see how they reacted to a deformed individual. Those who did not show kindness would be rejected. For one of the duties of his clergy was to help the crippled and disabled of society.</p>
<p>On Toril, the dwarves of Faerûn occasionally showed reverence for Hephaestus, due to him representing powers of smith-work and the earth, but this was only a rare occurrence.</p>
<h3>Places of Worship</h3>
<p>Temples and shrines to Hephaestus typically had a fire that was kept perpetually lit. Most also included a smithy or other workshop. His temples tended to resemble gigantic smithies as well.</p>
