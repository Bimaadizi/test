<p>A carpet of fighting was a magic item originating in Zakhara , the Land of Fate.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Carpets of fighting were available in many beautiful or mundane variations.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rugs acted like rugs of smothering but were activated by a command word spoken by the owner of the rug. Upon speaking the command word, a carpet of fighting would wrap itself around a target of the owner's choosing, causing the target to fall unconscious within minutes. Targets that did not breathe were not rendered unconscious but simply held by the carpet.</p>
<p>Once wrapped by the carpet, the target could only escape if they possessed immense strength, if the owner's willed it, or if a hold plant , animate object , or a wish spell was used. Any attacks made upon the carpet while it held its target also damaged the target.</p>
