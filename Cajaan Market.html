<p>Cajann Market was a vast, open-air marketplace in Calimport .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>By both day and night, the marketplace was full of bazaar carts and stands with merchants hawking their wares. The sabbalad , Pasha Nur el Wariq , charged high fees for use of the selling space.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The market took up the majority of Cajaan Sabban in Grand Ward and covered three separate drudachs : Dabun , Samelej , and Mit'adh .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The site was once the home of Cajaan Bazaar , which included four shining white-marble khanduqs built during the Third Age of Calimshan when the Cajaan Dynasty ruled. The Cajaan Khanduqs, the entire bazaar area, and all but about twenty of the buildings in the entire sabban burned to the ground during the Trades Conflagration of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR . The vast sums of gold stored in the khanduqs melted and poured down into the Muzad to be collected by the undercity's citizens of dubious reputation.</p>
