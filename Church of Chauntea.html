<p>The Church of Chauntea was the primary religious organization of the followers of the deity Chauntea , the Great Mother. It was present almost everywhere in Faerûn , due to its prevalence in agrarian life.</p>
<h2>Dogma</h2>
<h3>Beliefs</h3>
<p>Faithfuls believed that Chauntea was as old as the world itself. They saw her as one that gave life to natural creatures and plants, and that gifted humanoid races with the secrets of agriculture.</p>
<p>Land owners and farmers hit with unproductive harvests visited her clerics for divine suggestions. If at any time plague or drought struck the crops, farmers looked to the goddess, since they hoped she would save the harvest due to her love of nature.</p>
<p>It was believed that money donated to a temple of the church would return to the giver tenfold.</p>
<h3>Attitudes</h3>
<p>Practitioners of the Chauntean faith cared about the fertility of the earth, the growing and reaping of plants, and the eternal cycle of life. They often shared food with strangers and people in need, freely sharing the bounty of the land.</p>
<p>Considering destruction and leveling without rebuilding as a disgrace, the faithful avoided using fire and planted a seed of a small plant at least once per tenday . They made to always till their wastes back into agricultural soil, in order to support new life.</p>
<p>Members of the clergy were quiet and patient, emulating the qualities they saw in their goddess. They were known for their wisdom, and for their willingness to help with agricultural work, taking a hands-on approach especially when farmers were ill of injured. This caused them to receive great respect and admiration from their peers.</p>
<p>While the faith revolved around a doctrine made of values and taboos, there were as many interpretations as there were practitioners. Knowing that their goddess was everywhere and could see everything, the majority of Nurturers led a good and honest life. A few however saw nothing wrong with lying or stealing in order to acquire good land—they reasoned that treasures don't feed anyone or keep them warm, and that lying was merely countering human foolishness with more of the same.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Priests of the faith had a mission to learn as much as possible about plants,including topics such as horticulture, plant types and diseases, and general folk knowledge regarding flora. Some Nurturers would also study monsters, while others would focus on details of the natural order of things such as erosion, water currents or wind patterns.</p>
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>Members of the clergy shared their knowledge with clergymen and laypeople alike. They encouraged civilized folks to enrich the land using methods such as replanting, composting, and irrigation. In addition to planting, priests instructed their flock on the identification of plants, and of disease impacting the flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Due to the clergy's teachings, most common folks felt a closeness to "natural cycles"—thanks to this, there were no religious nor social stigma regarding women's monthly bleeding.</p>
<h3>Agriculture</h3>
<p>On their travels members of the church planted trees, removed weeds hampering crops, prepared the land to receive crops, and used spells to drive away predators. They burned diseased plants as well as the corpse of plague-ridden animals in order to prevent contamination, and were always watching such blazes extremely carefully.</p>
<p>Chauntean agriculture included practices such as diverting waterways and draining wetlands to help plant more harvestable crops.</p>
<h3>Defense</h3>
<p>In some places such as Felshroun , members of the clergy would accompany patrols in order to defend the inhabitants against trouble.</p>
<h3>Seed banks</h3>
<p>The faithful of Chauntea were encouraged to donate any extra seed their plants yielded to temples, so the seeds could be redistributed to those in need.</p>
<h3>Raising orphans</h3>
<p>It was usual for orphans to be raised by priests and laypeople in their temples. The clergy of Chauntea was often tasked with such charges, as it was seen as a "neutral" faith by other clergies and could use the extra pair of hands to help with labor-intensive agricultural activities.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<h3>Clergy</h3>
<p>People of all races joined the church, and a vast majority of them were females. They were united in their profound love for the land, the balance of nature, and the beauty of plants. Most were gardeners or farmers by trade, and well-versed in the ways of herbalism and agriculture. Clerics usually tended to the faithful in civilized areas, such as towns and cities, while druids handled more rural areas. In some places, priestesses of Chauntea were also mistaken for witches by the local community.</p>
<p>Due to their affinity with the Earth domain , Earth genasi were common amongst the clergy. They were either clerics or laypeople, and often tasked with guarding duties.</p>
<p>Some truenamers joined the clergy as well, interested by the creation and cosmological structure of the Realms.</p>
<p>In the Uthgardt tribes, a clergy of female shamans served Chauntea, which was considered the patron of women.</p>
<h3>Internal allegiances</h3>
<p>While cordial, relations between clerics and druids were sometimes difficult: druids considered themselves the "true clerics of Chauntea", and saw city clerics as upstarts; while clerics viewed druids as a thing of the past, still useful in wild lands but destined to be replaced by a more professional and organized clergy.</p>
<p>Monks always allied themselves to the leader of a temple or druidic circle, whereas mystics and shamans were fiercely independent, reporting to their goddess directly.</p>
<p>The Chauntean faith was highly individualistic, and as such recognized no central authority. Hierarchy was based on wisdom and length of service, favoring the individuals with a higher understanding of nature and its cycles.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>In addition, rural clerics referred to themselves as "Pastorals", whereas some older sects focused on the wilderness called themselves the "True Shapers".</p>
<h3>Orders</h3>
<p>The clergy of Chauntea was known to have no affiliated military of knightly orders.</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<h3>Prayers</h3>
<p>As much as possible, members of the church strived to pray on freshly tilled ground, in a farmland, or in a garden. Wells and watering places were also considered acceptable praying locations.</p>
<h3>Ceremonies</h3>
<p>Ceremonies which took place outside were lit by sun or moonlight. Other ceremonies could be held in temples or shrines, in the house of the priests themselves, or even in barns or haylofts. Chaunteans believed that spending their wedding night in a freshly tilled field guaranteed a fertile marriage.</p>
<p>In Wa , Chauntean ceremonies involved small groups of people sitting around trees or bushes for about an hour, and singing softly about the abundance of nature. Such ceremonies were extremely peaceful, and white doves circled above the practitioners.</p>
<h3>Holidays</h3>
<p>During or around religious holidays, priests of Chauntea would often organize agricultural fairs.</p>
<h3>Religious Services</h3>
<p>The clergy of Chauntea presided over numerous marriage ceremonies. They also often acted as midwives for humanoids and animals alike.</p>
<h2>Bases</h2>
<p>Large temples often doubled as granaries, and places of worship as seed-storage—ensuring the prosperity of the nearby communities. While a couple very large temples existed, most were of a modest size. Some temples also maintained impressive gardens. Her temples often had great libraries dedicated to agriculture.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of temples and shrines, it was common for services to be provided in open fields or druid groves .</p>

<p>Adventuring chaunteans usually wore simple clothes, such as undecorated robes, cloaks, or tunics and trousers. They favored earthly tones such as green and brown, except for mystics who sometimes relied on more colorful fabrics such as bright greens and yellows. High ranking druids wore a belt laced with golden threads, or similarly precious decorations.</p>

<h3>Church of Silvanus</h3>
<p>Some amongst the Church of Silvanus mocked the lessons provided by the clergy of Chauntea, viewing agriculture as an affront to nature and a precursor of overpopulation. Over time, a lot of the oldest Chauntean druids became Silvanites as they felt their original faith would cause great damage to the natural balance. Nevertheless members of both churches have always been allied, sharing a common mindset, love of nature, and common goals.</p>
<h3>Church of Lathander</h3>
<p>The churches of Chauntea and Lathander were close, as practitioners of both faith were expected to plant seeds and seedlings and care for them.</p>
