<p>Ponton was a cleric of Tyr in Urml in the Shining Plains in 1358 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Ponton took care of the temple of Tyr in Urml, where was kept the Hand of Tyr artifact gauntlet.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ponton started his training in the Church of Tyr in Urml under Devron , an old cleric who had fought during the famed Battle of Urml of 1258 DR . So he became enthusiastic about the anniversary in 1358 DR, but disliked that the event had become a kind of reenactment and local festival instead of a celebration of Tyr.</p>
<p>During the goblin attack on the reenactment, the arcanaloth Yrkhetep , posing as the White Warrior, arrived and asked for the Hand of Tyr from Ponton, who happily gave to him.</p>
