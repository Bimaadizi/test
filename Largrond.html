Her goal was a revenge attack after Azmyrandyr participated in an attack on Silverymoon . After slaying Azmyrandyr and his apprentices, she continued to slay around the temple; the temple master, Maeldur , called on one of his underlings to rouse two visitors, those being Ylondan and Largrond.</p>
<p>The two quickly joined the fight after casting ironguard , and briefly discussed their strategy, right in front of her. Largrond cast an antimagic field, while Ylondan cast a spell to shatter the ceiling on top of her.
