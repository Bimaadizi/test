<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The weapon was a light an flexible weapon carved with mithral sigils of elven crafting.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Melf's first staff possessed a simple +1 enchantment that strengthened the weapon 's blows and aided the wielder's aim. It also strengthened the wielder's offensive magics and made their effects harder to dodge or shake off. Additionally, the wielder could cast Melf's acid arrow once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The staff was presumed to come from the world of Oerth and wielded by Melf during his time leading the order of the Knights of Luna . Some speculated that not just despite his amusing name but because of it, Melf was a talented wizard and an innovator. By some unknown means, Melf's first staff ended up on Toril sometime in or before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , where it fell into the hands of Blurg , an orog member of the Society of Brilliance during his studies at a friendly myconid colony near the Ebonlake Grotto in the Western Heartlands ' Underdark .</p>
