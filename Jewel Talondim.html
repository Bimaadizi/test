<p>Jewel Talondim was the matriarch of the Talondim Clan , an independent thieves' clan in the city of Iriaebor not allied with any guild.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Typically, freelancers were disposed of by larger, territorial guilds, such as the Purple Masks Guild . But, due to Jewel leadership, other thieves' guilds sought to ally themselvesÂ instead.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>She had a sharp mind and was quick-witted. She led her clan with a strong hand.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was a beautiful woman. She had short onyx-black hair, burnished amber skin, and dusky violet eyes. When she was traveling, she wore riding leathers dyed the same dusky violet color as her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked to be the same age as Mari Al'maren , in around her 30s, when she was in fact 93 in 1364 DR . She claimed that this was not due to magic, but good blood.</p>
