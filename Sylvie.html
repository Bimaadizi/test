<p>Sylvie was a corrupted dryad that briefly took over Uthe Lodge in Eveningstar during the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Halsaime 's magical plague turned Sylvie's leafy body from a healthy green to a dull reddish-brown, and she exuded a yellow-green haze about her body. The plant growth she encouraged was an unhealthy profusion of weeds and vines, including large red flowers that were related to red musk zombies . Although rooted well underground, her tree had grown up through the ceiling to reach daylight.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Under the influence of Halsaime's madness, spread from his cursed staff , Sylvie's personality was warped into a single-minded murderous fixation set on using nature as a weapon and destroying civilization.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Like many dryads, Sylvie could call on the powers of nature. She was able to cast creeping doom , call lightning , call lightning storm , enveloping swarm , and ice storm .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At the same time as the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar , Sylvie and her tree were planted and rapidly grew in a cavern beneath Uthe Lodge, protected by wolves , red musk zombies, wisps , and wood woads including Falcata , Robur , and Prinus . They had been subverted by the druid Halsaime , who had infected the ranger Peron Uthe and allowed him to spread a strange magically-empowered disease to his home and the Eveningstar War Hospital . Sylvie and her fellows sought to consume first the building, and eventually the whole town of Eveningstar as part of a campaign against everything they perceived as being against nature. Under her influence, the building was overgrown with vegetation that continually bloomed and rotted as it expanded. Her tree was planted underground in a small cavern connected to the home, though it grew up and out through the top of Uthe Lodge's roof in a fairly obvious manner.</p>
<p>The overgrown Lodge was noticed by the local Eolynn Arva , who asked adventurers to investigate. They found the Harper agent Jussko Kwahn , who was already there searching for a way to find Oriphaun Huntsilver . Together, they fought their way through Sylvie's defenses and destroyed her and her tree, ending the threat to Eveningstar.</p>
