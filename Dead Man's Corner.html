<p>The Dead Man's Corner was a ramshackle and crammed shop in Skullport that traded in human zombies in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The shop was run by a sea hag disguised as an old woman named Olive Stillwater in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR . Her inventory included twelve zombies on average. Her corpses came with a leash for the buyer to drag their zombies around. These leashes were nooses around zombies' necks. Each shambler was sold for a humble price of a single vial of the buyer's blood and three hairs from their head.</p>
