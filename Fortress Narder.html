<p>Fortress Narder was a ruined stone fort located in the far eastern edge of the Forest of Lethyr in the Great Dale .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>It was built in antiquity by the Nar people under the Nentyarch Ulthas "the Darkwing" as a gathering point for the Nar armies debarking for Raumathar. It was destroyed during the last great conflict with Raumathar by some unidentified spell that reduced it to rubble.</p>
<p>In the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR a foul taint seeped out of the ruined fortress, poisoning the water and soil in the land around, and foul creatures crept out from the ruins, hunting and slaying the wildlife nearby. In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , the leader of the Circle of Leth , the self-proclaimed Nentyarch , feared that the poisoning was due to a demoncyst located somewhere beneath the ruins, as hezrou demons were encountered lurking in the depths of the ancient fortress.</p>
