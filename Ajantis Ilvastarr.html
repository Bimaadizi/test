<p>Ajantis Ilvastarr was a noble paladin of Helm and a knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart that lived during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Fitting for a paladin, Ajantis was known to be a self-righteous, yet somewhat naive individual.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was acquainted with another squire of the Radiant Heart, Anomen Delryn of Athkatla .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ajantis was born to the noble Ilvastarr family of Waterdeep . During his youth he received exceptional martial training learning the art of sword-fighting under the tutelage of Myrmith Splendon .</p>
<p>Some years later he joined the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart and garnered the attention of the highly respected Keldorn Firecam . He served the elder knight as a squire and a member of the Radiant Heart Auxiliary .</p>
<p>When the iron crisis plagued the Sword Coast in the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Ajantis felt a call-to-action. He sought to investigate the bandits that plagued the region in order to attain the status within his order as a full-fledged knight.</p>
<p>By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Ajantis made his way down to Amn. Some time that year, Ajantis and other knights of the Radiant Heart spent time traveling through the Windspear Hills . Unbeknownst to them, the knights had illusions placed upon them by Lord Jierdan Firkraag . The magic gave the knights the appearance of ogres , and also made them perceive other humanoids the same way. As a result of the illusion, Ajantis and his companions were slain by Gorion's Ward .</p>
