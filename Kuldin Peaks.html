<p>The Kuldin Peaks were a small cluster of mountains in the country of Erlkazar at the border with Tethyr .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Kuldin Peaks fell within the borders of the barony of Carrelath in Erlkazar. They were the middle peaks of the Iltkazar Range , which ran north to the Giant's Run Mountains and south to the Alimirs .</p>
<p>The mountains were surrounded by foothills. The mountains themselves were steep and snow-covered for most of the year, and the tree line ended about half way up most of the peaks.</p>
<p>Swimstar Creek began in these peaks, and its waters fed the Shining Stream , which in turn fed the River Ith .</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Shield dwarves were known to live in these mountains, as were ogres , gnolls , and trolls . The Starrock goblin tribe lived there also.</p>
<p>The red dragon Charvekannathor laired in the Kuldin Peaks and kept them free from orcs .</p>
<p>Kartak Spellseer , a powerful lich and member of the Twisted Rune lived in the Kuldin Peaks within an abandoned dwarven mine.</p>
<h2>Trails & Byways</h2>
<p>The Kuldin Peaks were largely unexplored and no major road passed through them, because of how abruptly the peaks rose from among the foothills. However, small trails and passes blazed by the dwarves of Shanatar were used by brave travelers and patrols or shepherds from Carrelath.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Together with the Omlarandin Mountains , the Kuldin Peaks were the lands of the old sub-kingdom of Iltkazar , a part of Shanatar . In ages past a great battle was fought here between giants and dwarves led by Turbold . Mount Turbold and Turbold Vale were named after this dwarven leader.</p>
<p>The evil lich Kartak Spellseer , hid within the Kuldin Peaks after he was freed from his prison by Rysellan on the night before his execution for murdering fourteen people.</p>
<p>In 1358 DR , a year-long war broke out between the Starrock goblins and the country of Erlkazar. The humans strangely made an alliance with a tribe of ogres, and the goblins were defeated.</p>
