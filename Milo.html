<p>Milo was a new recruit of the Shadow Thieves who resided in the stronghold within Undermountain in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime in early 1370 DR , Shadow Thieves guild regained pretense in Waterdeep via a hidden stronghold in the top levels of Undermountain. The guild's activities included recruitment, and Milo was one of the young halflings that joined. Missing a cold personality and assassin skills, he was stationed to work in the hideout's kitchen, where he proved himself adequate in cooking the Undermountain's easiest meat - rats , both average and giant . Rat stew was his speciality.</p>
<p>When the guild's pretense was discovered by Khelben Arunsun , he sent a lone hero he recently recruited as his agent to Waterdeep's mega-dungeon. The adventurer discovered the stronghold's location and eventually infiltrated the thieves' lair, slaying the Guild Master. Being not much of a fighter, Milo pleaded for his life and offered the lone hero his rat stew and free passage in exchange for his life.</p>
