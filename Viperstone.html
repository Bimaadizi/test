<p>Viperstone was a small hamlet on the shores of the scenic Firedrake Bay , along the Firedrake Road , in Tethyr . It was best known for its dealings with Calishite alchemists .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The small village was one of many hamlets that were sprinkled along the minor trade route of the Firedrake Road, which bent along the Firedrake Shores , through the Dragon's Neck Peninsula , and reached the Dragon's Head Peninsula . Viperstone was among the more notable hamlets, along with its closest southern neighbor, the hamlet of Rock Orchard .</p>
<p>The hamlet's name came from the abundant population of venomous snakes found sunning on the nearby rocks. This regularly brought a number of alchemists from the land of Calimshan , who gathered baskets full of the dangerous creatures at a time.</p>
