<h2>History</h2>
<p>About two tendays into the Chaos of the Art in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , Kadeln Parosper came to a balcony of the House of the Ladystar upon hearing the Archmage of the Phoenix Tower , Tenthar Taerhamoos , was looking for him. He gave the man a warning that they knew not the source of the Chaos of the Art, and mentioned fears that Mystra may have died ere he was pulled away, as the mob was hearing him. As Tenthar turned to leave, the archmage was forced to attack the mob with a deadly spell to gain himself the freedom to escape. Two of the people in the mob, who appeared to have been slain by his chain lightning spell, later rose, and spoke, revealing themselves to be Mystra and Azuth to the priests and onlookers before disappearing. As a sign, one of the pikes used to keep away the mob appeared in Kadeln's hand. In response, he fainted.</p>
