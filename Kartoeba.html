<p>Kartoeba , or the "Thing in the Pit" , was an ageless abominable ooze creature that was believed to be a unique being on the world of Mystara , but one such creature was known to be found on Toril .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These creatures were nightmarish abominations: mounds of green acidic ooze with 40‑foot-long (12‑meter) tentacles and a single gaping, ever-hungry maw.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Kartoeba was a mindless creature guided by its basic desire to eat. Despite its size, it moved soundlessly and with equal ease across floors and walls, leaving only an occasional smear of green slime where it passed.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Any creature that faced the much-maligned "Thing in the Pit" for the first time was taken over by primal terror, sending those of weaker morale into a fear-induced panic.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>In battle, Kartoeba lashed with four tentacles that bludgeoned its victims and left them burned with acid . Those enemies who were unlucky enough to be entangled by a tentacle were swiftly dragged into the creature's mouth to be immediately devoured. The tentacles pulled victims at the speed of 10 feet (3 meters) per minute. The creature's body and tentacles always secreted corrosive digestive acids, similar to those of black puddings , but stronger.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Kartoeba inhabited damp, sunless underground pits. If provided with sustenance, Kartoeba would not even consider leaving its comfortable cavern. It never left underground in daylight, but under the cover of night, it could slither out to the surface in search of food.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kartoeba was an ancient monster that guarded the Hutaakan Temple of Pflarr on the world of Mystara. On Toril, a singular Thing in the Pit inhabited a ruin, long-lost by the 14 th century DR , in the Flooded Forest in the Vast . The ruin was once a temple to Bane , the god of tyranny. A document discovered by Ombedor Steen , stated that the ruin was the first temple dedicated to Bane after his apotheosis. The deity personally established the temple before the Flooded Forest became flooded and corrupted, when it was still part of Cormanthor . Kartoeba comfortably lived in the depths of the temple's damp pits, feeding on the church's sacrifices. When the temple fell to ruin, Kartoeba began stalking the temple's sewage tunnels.</p>
