<p>The Tribunal of Evernight was a council of intelligent ghouls who served as the government of that city.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The Tribunal's main role was to settle disputes that Evernight's undead residents could not otherwise manage. If called upon to resolve a disagreement, the Tribunal held court in the House of Screams , and was known to proclaim its verdict by eating the losing party, which led to few cases actually being brought before them. Even very powerful undead, such as liches , could not resist a decision by the Tribunal else risk destruction. However, the Tribunal were wary of vampires , whose abilities allowed them to escape from the House of Screams more easily than most undead, and thus were harder to catch and eat if found guilty.</p>
<p>The Tribunal only occasionally made edicts, for example, to preserve the neutrality of their city in the face of mortal conflicts. One of their most unpopular laws was granting themselves the power to declare a living creature to be a "citizen" of Evernight, thus making it illegal for the undead residents to eat them. Living visitors to Evernight were advised to petition the Tribunal's good will and guidance upon arriving in the city, and to bring a suitable gift or tribute to entice them to grant their protection. If they chose to bestow their protection, it was implicitly understood that the mortal visitor had entered into a pact with the Tribunal to obey the laws of Evernight, although the mortal was not necessarily made aware of the terms of this pact. Protection was immediately revoked if the visitor violated the pact (for example, if they killed an Evernight citizen), turning them into the prey of every undead citizen in sight.</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Tribunal presided over disputes within the House of Screams, a dilapidated manor within the Black Mound neighborhood of Evernight. They might also hold impromptu audiences with new arrivals in the city at a podium in the streets not far from the Graveyard .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>The Tribunal claimed to have access to a mighty weapon known as the Pool of Daylight located deep within the Temple of Filth .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR , the tribunal had extended its protection to the living members of the Thayan outpost and the Shadovar Embassy . However, as tensions flared between the two factions in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the Tribunal declared that any open conflict would result in the loss of their protection from Evernight's hungry undead.</p>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The Tribunal consisted of three intelligent ghouls or ghasts , generally disciples of Orcus , former spellcasters , or otherwise ancient beings that had become mighty and powerful. A petitioner for their protection was wise to bring some treasure or talisman of Orcus to curry their favor.</p>
<p>As of the late 15 th century DR, the leader of the Tribunal was known as Gamorst .</p>
