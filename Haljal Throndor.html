<p>Haljal Throndor was a dwarf blacksmith who ran the Cracked Anvil in Port Llast in the latter half of the 14th century DR.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He felt the most at home when surrounded by the stone walls of a proper mine, but following his injury his lungs could not handle the fumes from underground smelting.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Haljal was considered to be a skilled craftsman, adept at all forms of ironmongery.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Haljal was once a miner north of Mirabar until a terrible cave-in crushed the right side of his body, forcing him to retire. He wandered around for almost a century before establishing his blacksmith shop in Port Llast. While he was content with his life in the small town, once Haljal found a cleric who could heal his wounds, he planned to return to his former homeland.</p>
