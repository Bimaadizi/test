<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1297 DR , Ginafae De Vir was the matron mother of the fourth house and thus the youngest matron in the Ruling Council. During a drow raid against svirfneblin , she used her clerical powers to aid the deep gnomes (the drow's greatest enemies) so that they would kill the wizard son of the third house, House De Vir's chosen enemy. In doing so, Ginafae lost the favor of Lolth . Her house was subsequently destroyed by House Do'Urden . Ginafae herself was killed by Zaknafein Do'Urden , who used his whip to take out her tongue as she tried to cast a spell.</p>
<p>After her death, Ginafae's ghost was summoned by her son, Alton De Vir , who was attempting to learn the identity of the house that destroyed House De Vir. Before she could answer, however, a yochlol interrupted and revealed that as a fallen priestess, Ginafae was continuously tormented in the Abyss .</p>
