<p>Shilaris Shemwith was the mastermind behind the attack and siege of the city of Hlondeth by the kobolds of the Tattered Cloth Legion in 527 DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Tatters, 527 DR , the city of Hlondeth came under a surprising assault from a legion of kobolds who emerged from the city's sewers under cover of the night. The ensuing slaughter resulted in over 1,000 inhabitants of Hlondeth being killed. The Tattered Cloth Legion besieged the city quarter that housed Hlondeth's rich and powerful and torched the governor's palace. The siege and slaughter lasted for a week until Lord Shevron Extaminos led an army of snakes against invaders, seeing the city freed at the price of his own life. As the dust settled, it became apparent that the kobolds were driven to Hlondeth by Shilaris Shemwith, a drow leader under the commands of the dark elf queen Nathglaryst of Undraeth . As the war raged, Shilaris moved Hlondeth's treasury to the sewers and disappeared along with the gold never to be seen on the surface again.</p>
