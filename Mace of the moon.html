<p>Maces of the moon were enchanted maces wielded by the clergy of Selûne against the church's undead enemies.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These bludgeons were blessed by High Priestesses of Selûne under the full moon's glow. The divine moonlight was stored within maces' sharp flanges, creating a powerful +3 enchantment. Every time a mace of the moon struck an undead creature, it discharged radiant energy, damaging the targets. Additionally, the wielder of the mace was granted the ability to cast the lesser restoration spell once per day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>As of the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , maces of the moon could be found in Thentia and Elmwood temples of Selûne—the House of the Moon and the Temple of the Half Moon .</p>
