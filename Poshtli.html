<h2>History</h2>
<p>Poshtli was the nephew of Naltecona and one of his wisest advisors.</p>
<p>In 1361 DR , Poshtli sensed something was wrong and went in search of answers. After a stop at the House of Tezca , where he received a vision from the Sunstone , he went to Ulatos in time to save Erixitl 's life from one of the Ancient Ones .</p>
<p>He befriended both Erixitl and Halloran and together they decided to work for peace between Nexal and the Golden Legion , which had just arrived from Faer√ªn .</p>
<p>Poshtli went back to Nexal but thanks to the plots of the worshipers of Zaltec , a battle was fought between the legionaries and Nexalans . Afterward, Naltecona decided to submit to the Legion's leader Cordell . When Naltecona was taken hostage by the legionaries, Poshtli was named substitute regent.</p>
<p>With the help of Erixitl and Halloran, Poshtli tried to free his uncle, a key player in stopping Zaltec's plots, but they failed and so started the Night of Wailing .</p>
<p>Poshtli survived and helped lead the column of refugees. He joined Halloran's party at Twin Visages and was decisive in killing both Coton and Darien , banishing both Zaltec and Qotal from Maztica .</p>
<p>At last he decided to live in the new city of Tukan . As of 1362 DR , Poshtli was the war leader of Tukan.</p>
