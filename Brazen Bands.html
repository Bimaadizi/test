<p>Brazen Bands were enchanted defensive bracers that increased the wielder's mundane defense, as opposed to giving them magical protection.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These bands possessed magics that attracted the enemy's attacks and canceled their inertia, offering mundane protection as effective as a full set of heavy chainmail . But unlike actual chainmails, the wearer was unrestricted or encountered by the armor.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Griffon, 1312 DR , a set of Brazen Bands belonged to Bashshar al Rachid , a famous collector, merchant, and the wealthiest djinni on Toril , who found himself trapped in a genie prison .</p>
