<p>Mind worms were powerful psionic creatures thought to be the result of illithid experimentation.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Mind worms were massive, worm-like creatures (generally compared to purple worms in shape) some 5 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter, 60 feet (18 meters) in length, and 22,500 pounds (10,200 kilograms) in weight. Their skin was a nasty, sickly, pale purple color.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Mind worms had both formidable physical abilities and powerful psionic talents. They had both darkvision and blindsense , were immune to the effects of acid and mental attacks, and were resistant to spells; they could also swallow creatures whole or unleash a blast of psionic power in a 60‑foot (18‑meter) cone. Mind worms could also use the psionic powers of greater scrying and plane shift at will.</p>
<p>Perhaps their most significant and deadly ability, however, was that they could create "probe worms": a tiny, worm-like construct of psionic energy , which a mind worm could have up to four active and could create out of any fluid or reflective surface they could sense- even through scrying. Probe worms could physically attack creatures up to 15 ft (4.6 m) away from the surface they originated from, and- on a particularly lucky or precise strike- could allow a mind worm to use a linked ability that let them psionically transport the victim into its stomach. Probe worms could also induce fear in creatures they attacked.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Mind worms preferred to attack enemies with their probes worms rather than face them directly, and typically targeted obvious spellcaster first. If confronted physically, a mind worm would seek to retreat back into water.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Mind worms were solitary creatures that lived in subterranean, aquatic habitats. They were sometimes utilized by illithids as assassins and bounty hunters.</p>
<p>Quite unlike purple worms, mind worms were highly intelligent and capable of speech: they were recorded to speak Undercommon , albeit in a disturbing, gurgling voice.</p>
