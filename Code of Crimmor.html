<p>The Code of Crimmor described the various rules and laws that determined which activities were permitted or forbidden in the Amnian city of Crimmor .</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Several organizations made sure the Code was respected and the inhabitants were kept safe:</p>
<h2>Judgement</h2>
<p>There where no jury in Crimmor, but six Suziers ( pronounced : /ˈ s uː z ɪər / SOO-zeer ) of the Thaeldorn who served as judges. Upon breaching the code, an offender would be brought before a Suzier or before the Mayor, who would decide of their punishment. This process was swift: an offender would usually be brought before a magistrate on the same day they were apprehended, or before noon if they were caught at night. On the rare occasion where more information was necessary, such as finding witnesses, the Suzier could decide to keep a prisoner in custody up to three days.</p>
<p>All trials were held publicly, and accused persons could speak freely to plead their cause.</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Some Suziers were known to have more patience than others, thus pleading offenders had to be careful not to hurt their cause. The mayor was said to be more lenient towards wealthy accused—which was sometimes true—but was overall recognized as a fair-minded and well-meaning individual, who truly wanted the best for the town and its inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Citizenship</h2>
<p>Some crimes were punished differently if they impacted a citizen or a visitor. In Crimmor, someone was considered a citizen if they owned land, paid rent, or resided in the city since at least one season.</p>
<h2>Punishment</h2>
<p>While the death penalty existed in Crimmor, it wasn't the norm. Most crimes would result in a fine (payable to the Thaeldorn) or some damages (payable to the victim or their family). Imprisonment and forced labor were not unusual, as was public flogging. More heinous acts could have the perpetrator branded or banished from the city.</p>
<h3>Branding</h3>
<p>Branding with a hot iron was usually combined with other punishment, and was reserved for very specific crimes.</p>
<h3>Edicts</h3>
<p>An edict was a public decree published by the Mayor, which was posted on all the city gates and on the doors of the Thaeldorn. Those decrees were proclaimed aloud when posted, and usually forbade a convicted person from doing something specific—such as repeating their crime. Some decree had more impact, and could for example forbid someone from taking part in a line of business. Violating an edict would result in further punishment, such as paying a fine and doing manual work.</p>
<h3>Fines and damages</h3>
<p>Fines were paid to the Thaeldorn, as opposed to damages which were paid to the victim or their family. In the convicted criminal was unable to pay a fine or damages, their property would be seized and the remaining amount would be converted to hard labor until the value of the work satisfied the court debt.</p>
<h3>Flogging</h3>
<p>Flogging was always done using a drover's whip on the prisoner's back, with the convicted stripped to the waist and wrist-manacled to restraints. To add to the humiliation, it was usually done in taverns as a form of entertainment. A patrol from the Crimmor Guard was always present during flogging to ensure the prisoner wouldn't be mistreated by the spectators.</p>
<h3>Hard Labor</h3>
<p>During hard labor prisoners wore leg-shackles and had to perform physically exhausting tasks such as repairing the streets and city walls, or dredging the river.</p>
<h3>Manual Work</h3>
<p>Prisoners sentenced to manual work didn't have to wear shackles. They would be required to perform simple tasks such as replacing wall-mortar, mending roofs and chimneys, clearing snow and ice during winter, or emptying chamberpots.</p>
<h2>Laws</h2>
<h3>Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Crimmor had a set of laws regarding the practice of the Art . The laws specifically defined "harmful spellcasting" as any magic that would cause damage to a person or property, cause an immediate accident, or push a person to suicide. The cause could be indirect, such as a fear spell causing a horse to run down a street and trample a bystander, or some enchantment magic causing a victim to believe themselves afflicted by a painful and inescapable condition and consequently ending their life .</p>
<h2>Rumors</h2>
<p>According to Volothamp Geddarm , a punishment called hookfingers was reserved for artists, forgers, scribes, and clerks who had offended prominent families. It consisted in being hung from the city walls by means of fishing hooks driven through the offender's fingers and thumbs, causing one's weight to tear the body free and making future writing impossible or incredibly painful. In addition, guards armed with clubs would wait at the bottom to strike the convict after their fall.</p>
