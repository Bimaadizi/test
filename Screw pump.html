<p>A screw-lift water pump was a simple but ingenious mechanical device used to pump water vertically.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The pump lifted water by means of carrying it inside its screw-shaped chamber as it rotated.</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue offered a version devised by the mind of Nadul Da Roni , valued at 75 gp . He reported that 30 turns of the crank brought up 5 gallons (0.019 cubic meters) of water, and noted its potential use in pumping hot oil .</p>
<p>The concept of the screw pump was seemingly independently invented in multiple locations. This included the House of Gond in Essembra , where such devices were put on display for the public, and the Steps of Istishia in Keltar , where the pumps were used to supply water to the top of the enormous fountain structure.</p>
