<p>Largo was a mithral mine owner from the City of Coin, Athkatla , in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Largo was a portly man with sun-kissed skin.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Largo was a lowly commoner in his youth. His attitude towards the rich and noble of Athkatla, as well as his lack of status and coin led him to be thrown out of the Mithrest Inn a couple of times. Later in life, Largo discovered a rich mithral deposit that made him wealthy enough to gain entrance to the posh establishment like the inn that once barred him from entry. By the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , Largo could often be found in the Mithrest. Despite his wealth, he still thought the rich to be bastards who only cared about his gold-filled purse.</p>
