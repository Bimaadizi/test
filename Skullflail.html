<p>Skullflail , more commonly known as the The Flail of Teeth , was an enchanted flail created for the barbarian warlord Wychgar of North Faerûn in the 11 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Skullflail's heads were three literal skeletal heads inhabited by the spirits of three ancient barbarians. They grinned menacingly in battle and bit the opponents when given an opportunity. The skulls were attached to the weapon's shaft by silver chains.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This powerful weapon possessed a potent +4 enchantment that enhanced the damage and guided the weapon to its targets. Each skull's bite landed additional damage in battle.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Flail of Teeth was created in the Year of Falling Stars, 1035 DR , following the battle in the Hallowed Pass in the frozen wastelands of North Faerûn against a force of orcs led by Kraag the Mighty . The conflict cost the lives of Wychgar's three brothers. When the battle was over, Wychgar scoured the battlefield, consumed by mourning, searching for the bodies of his siblings. Eventually, the warlord found his brothers' broken bodies. This was when he was visited by the brothers' spirits, who became cursed with being bound to the Prime Material plane . Unable to find another solution, Wychgar had a shaman bind the brothers' spirits to the bone flail he called the Skullflail , made out of the fallen siblings' skulls.</p>
<p>Presumably, the The Flail of Teeth left Wychgar's possessions after his death and in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR , the magic barbarian flail ended up in the hands of Hobart Stubbletoes , the halfling responsible for the disappearance of the the Heroes of Icewind Dale .</p>
