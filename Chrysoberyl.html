<p>Chrysoberyl was a fancy stone found in the Realms. It had many uses, but when used for short-range scrying , a specimen of this gem was called a cat's eye .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chrysoberyl was a hard stone that wore well, so it was usually facet-cut into transparent yellow-green to pale green jewels. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This gem was used in enchanting devices that provided protection against magic jar spells or other forms of (usually necromantic ) possession.</p>
<p>Using rare enchantments, chrysoberyl chips or whole stones could be melted into the metal when forging a weapon, allowing the implement to strike ethereal and gaseous creatures, such as ghosts and phase spiders .</p>
<p>Powdered chrysoberyl mixed with the liquid extracted from a particular crushed flower formed a paste that could be applied externally on the body to stop the spread of mummy rot and all molds and fungus.</p>
<p>A chrysoberyl gem could be used for short-range but very detailed scrying . For that reason, it was known as a cat's eye .</p>
<p>Chrysoberyl was one of the "nine secrets"â€”stones that could be enchanted to become ioun stones .</p>
<p>In ancient Netheril , these gems were sometimes used by the sorcerer -kings as message stones that would speak a recorded voice when touched. Message stones that survived the ages were highly prized whether the message was an intimate note to a lover, an inspirational quote, instructions for a magical procedure, or directions to a treasure trove that may or may not have been discovered.</p>
<p>Chrysoberyl stones were believed to have ties to Outer Planes that explained their magical properties especially against the undead and demonic possession.</p>
