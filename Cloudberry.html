<p>Cloudberries were a species of raspberry endemic to the High Moor region.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Much like other raspberry species, the fruits of the cloudberry bush grew on long, whip -like and wiry branches that were known as canes. But unlike the standard raspberry, these fruits had a yellowish hue.</p>
<p>Much like the bilberry bush, their canes tended to form dense, interwoven thickets that made it challenging to retrieve these berries.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Said to be very palatable, cloudberries were a staple in the diet of many animals that inhabited the High Moor plateau, with even humans and goblinkin known to forage for them.</p>
