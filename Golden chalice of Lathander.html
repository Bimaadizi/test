<p>Golden chalice of Lathander was an enchanted gold chalice imbued with Lathander 's divine magic.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The chalices of Lathander were finely crafted out of pure gold and were decorated or engraved with symbols of a sun rising on a rose in full bloom.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Upon the use of the chalice's command word, the item started shedding bright light, similar to that of the light spell. The light ability of the chalice could be activated any number times a day and it did not consume one of the item's three charges. The activation of the chalice's healing circle spell, on the other hand, consumed one of its charges. When all three charges had been expended, the chalice still retained its light -giving magic.</p>
