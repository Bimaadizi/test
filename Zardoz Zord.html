<p>Zardoz Zord was the leader of the Sea Maidens Faire carnival, which operated a trio of ships that traveled the Sword Coast : the Heartbreaker , the Eyecatcher , and the Hellraiser . He spent most of his time aboard the Eyecatcher , his personal ship. The other two carried members of the carnival, as well as parade wagons.</p>
<h2>The Truth</h2>
<p>Zardoz Zord was a disguise donned by Jarlaxle Baenre used to infiltrate the city of Waterdeep in the late 15 th century DR . The Sea Maidens Faire was a cover operation to hide the fact that Jarlaxle was searching for the Stone of Golorr . However, Jarlaxle performed in the Sea Maidens Faire's parades under the guise of Zardoz Zord purely for the fun of it.</p>
<p>While the Sea Maidens Faire was real and did perform, the three ships were run by the Bregan D'aerthe , and were teeming with drow under Jarlaxle's employ. The figureheads of each of Jarlaxle's ships made the crew appear to be human at all times. The only way to dispel this effect was to destroy the figurehead.</p>
