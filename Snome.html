<p>The Snome ( pronounced : / s n oʊ m m / ss NOmm ) family was a human noble family in Waterdeep . Their primary interests were in brewing, distilling, importing, and exporting alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Snome family made their fortune by brewing beer , distilling spirits, and importing those same commodities to a thirsty Waterdeep. In the mid–14 th century, the family patriarch was Lord Arrabas . Before he passed away, circa 1370 DR , he chose his successor to be his youngest grandson, Dandobar .</p>
<h2>Base of Operations</h2>
<p>The Snome estate was located in the North Ward on the corner of Phull Lane and Trollkill Street . The family villa was set back from both roads in a walled compound. Behind it was an alley that connected Phull Lane and Trollkill Street. Across Trollkill Street was the Trollwall .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Snome family villa was built in the Year of the Bold Knight, 1249 DR .</p>
<p>The clan was ennobled in the Year of the Wagon, 1273 DR and were of Illuskan descent. The head of the family skipped a generation because Arrabas, at age 112, had outlived all of his fourteen children and had to select an heir from a bevy of 47 grandchildren. Thyriellentha Snome felt slighted when Arrabas chose her cousin Dandobar over her and she distanced herself from the family because of it. Once Dandobar became the head of the family, he named Thyriellentha as his heir, but this did little to mollify the ambitious woman.</p>

<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>During the period 1249 to 1369 DR , the family lost seventeen servants, one at a time, always on the night of Shieldmeet during a fete hosted by the Snomes. Scant evidence seemed to dictate that they abandoned their posts and left town, but the true cause was a portal in the locked doorway to the section of the wine cellar that held the lord's private supplies. The portal was a one-way gate to the Crystal Labyrinth in Undermountain that was only active on Shieldmeet at night. During the event known as Halaster's Higharvestide , this portal worked in both directions, but it is unknown if anyone or anything passed through it.</p>
