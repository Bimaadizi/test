<p>Before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR , Sheydann Zinn was a merchant from the city of Neverwinter.

After the war, he decided to pursue simpler life and moved to the backwater village of West Harbor. There, Sheydann ran a small merchant business, trading in baubles and other common goods. Sheydann was a resident of West Harbor when the duo of black dragons , Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor , tried to take over the village's brewery. During his time in West Harbor, Sheydann befriended the Mayor's son, Jan Buckman .</p>
