<h2>History</h2>
<p>Red Morgan in 1367 DR was leading a five-member caravan carrying grain, lumber, and a small set of iron ingots from Dagger Falls to Zhentil Keep in order to buy soldiers' rations, spear hafts, arrow shafts, and weapons from the Zhent garrison.
However Red and his guard fought first a band of Freedom Riders and afterward a goblin pack. They were wounded and tired so Red decided to go back to Dagger Falls.</p>
