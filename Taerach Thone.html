<h2>History</h2>
<p>Per Calivar Murpeth , Thone had once killed a mage of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors in their own headquarters.</p>
<p>In 1369 DR , he was in Shadowdale , where Calivar brought him along for the slaying of the scribe Maervidal Iloster , arranged to happen at Warmfires House . After following him into the jakes there, he found no hair nor hide of the scribe; a local wench, Talantha, drew his attention. Suspecting her of having aided the scribe, he hired her for an hour, brought her upstairs with Calivar and the men, and drugged her with saisha , so that she could be interrogated. He also murdered the cook, Gustal Sorold , in front of her.</p>
<p>He took hot pokers from the fire to threaten her with during the interrogation; however, when she claimed that several of Calivar's men were with the scrivener when he asked for her help, Calivar listened, and directed Thone to kill the men she pointed out. Thone also pacified the one who protested their deaths, Toarin Klustoon .</p>
<p>Once Talantha revealed herself to be Storm Silverhand in disguise and slew all of them, she let him live upon accidentally discovering he was the author of her favourite chapbooks. She knocked him out, and stole him away to her farm.</p>
<p>At her farm, he found her vulnerable for a moment while she received some protections from Elminster Aumar in preparation for her ambush on Halaster Blackcloak ; hesitating, he ultimately decided not to kill her. Anastra Syluné Silverhand introduced herself to him afterwards.</p>
<p>He accompanied Sylune later when she joined Storm at Halaster's hideout, carrying a glittering stone in hand that was presumably one of Sylune's fireplace-stones. Seeing Storm wounded, he volunteered a potion out of his own possessions to heal her.</p>
