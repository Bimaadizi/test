<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR, Ratha Rann was 92 and had been retired for around 25 years, following some unexpected financial reverses. In his retirement years, Ratha Rann desperately tried to prove to everyone and himself that he was not yet old, showing it by courting every attractive female he met. One of his conquests was a woman who was 22 years younger than the retired adventurer, but when they planned to move in together, the age difference ended up being a public scandal and caused a breakup, leaving the man single ever since.</p>
<p>However, Ada the Unbending mesmerized the aging adventurer and, to impress her, Ratha Rann embarked on an adventure that ended up dragging him across several worlds, including Olympus , where they met the deity Hermes ; the jungles of Quorsit ; and the demi-plane of Kansas . He would face a frightful frost giant called Icehand in a duel.</p>
