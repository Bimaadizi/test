<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point, Aruugan had pledged himself to the god Bane .</p>
<p>Under Aruugan's leadership, the Black Wolf clan was one of the only tribes in the Giantspires able to maintain independence in the face of the expansionism of the Razor Heart tribe and their queen, Maaqua . Their continued success was thanks to his willingness to take shelter in the Dunwood alongside his clan's worg allies.</p>
