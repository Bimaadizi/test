<p>Bolifar Geldert was a War Wizard of Cormyr . He went missing in 1365 DR , from a chamber which once belonged to Amedahast .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was old, bony, and customarily stooped.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He considered himself studious, careful, and a hard worker, though he was doddering in his old age.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>At the time of his disappearance, he carried a writing satchel.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Alturiak of 1365 DR , Bolifar Geldert requested an out-of-the-way room to compile a report for Vangerdahast about the activities of the minor Cordallar noble family of Cormyr . He was given the keys to a room by Sardyl Crownsilver , and went missing hours afterwards, without any sign of activity whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>After his death, once all other tools were exhausted, Vangerdahast called on Elminster Aumar , who recognized the telltale traces of a trapper having been in the room to eat someone, and remembered that the magical map on the wall was actually a portal . Vangerdahast realized there and then that the Master of Beasts, Kaulgetharr Drell , must have helped kill the War Wizard; they were soon attacked by Baerune Cordallar , who tried to ambush them from the portal.</p>
