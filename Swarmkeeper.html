<p>Swarmkeepers were rangers that specifically bonded with swarming nature spirits that appeared throughout the Realms.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>There were some known swarmkeepers that dwelled within the Cloak Wood forest on the Sword Coast .</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>Some swarmkeepers preferred a solitary lifestyle away from civilization, free from the obligation of dealing with other people. Yet others used their powers to form and strengthen bonds with other members of their community, utilizing their swarms for the benefit of their fellows.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>A keepers' bond of nature spirits could manifest in a variety of different forms, including: a swarm of insects (such as dragonflies ), a horde of small-sized twig blights , a flock of birds, or a group of pixies , among others. These spirits assisted their keepers by helping carry or teleport them limited distances, attacking or knocking back their foes, or engulfing their body to deflect any oncoming attacks.</p>
<p>Experienced keepers could guide their swarm with expert control, directing them to manipulate objects a distance away, surround their foes so they were easier to strike , pin them in place , or even inflict physical harm . Additionally, these spirits could observe far away areas for their keeper, or even envelop them, allowing them to become insubstantial for a time.</p>
