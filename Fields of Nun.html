<p>The Fields of Nun was an open stretch of land running through the northern region of Chondath between the Vilhon Reach and the Akanamere .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Fields were fallow and tainted by the death and disease that had been inflicted there in times passed.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Fields of Nun lay between the Nunwood and the northern end of the Chondalwood . The River Nun ran through it.</p>
<p>The Fields lay along the Trail of Tears , a pilgrimage route for the devout of Tempus . Pilgrims arrived from a one-way portal in Mistledale amid a ring of standing stones on a hill overlooking the river, followed the trail to an unnamed barrow on which nothing could grow because of all the diseased soldiers buried beneath, and proceeded through another one-way portal to a low hillock on the south bank of the River Thazarim in southeastern Thay .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Fields of Nun was the site of an expenditure of Necromantic magic in Year of the Queen's Tears, 902 DR , that released a devastating plague upon Chondath during a civil war that was later called the Rotting War because of the disease.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR , Garagos appeared near the ruins of the village of Gosra to destroy the imposter marilith Glackzana who had constructed a temple in his name.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>The fields were haunted by ghouls and ghasts that still carried diseases from the Rotting War, such as cackle fever and red ache .</p>
