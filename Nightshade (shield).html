<p>The Nightshade was a unique enchanted shield that dated back to Myth Drannor 's glory days.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Nightshade was a small and round shield, patterned with stars.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>The enchantments woven into the shield increased the wielder's defense and reflexes at the cost of their constitution. Additionally, the Nightshade allowed its owner to cast the improved invisibility spell at will. This ability had only three charges.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Even though the shield dated back to the times before the Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor, the Nightshade ended up on the bottom of one of the many magical waters reservoirs of the Elven Catacombs . The shield was still there in 1369 DR , but the pool was inhabited by a swarm of flesh-eating fish . Anyone who was able to pacify or kill the animals could retrieve this enchanted item.</p>
