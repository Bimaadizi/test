<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR , Ehamond and the other tomb guards serving under Galaeron Nihmedu stumbled into the domain of a phaerimm behind the Sharn Wall far underground beneath the Greypeak Mountains . During that encounter he was held for a time by the strange beast, but eventually freed by his commander Galaeron and Takari. By the time the phaerimm was slain, only those three and two other tomb guardians remained alive.</p>
<p>Ehamond took care of Takari as they group traveled back to Evereska, taking her to High Huntsman Pleufan Trueshot and the healing waters of the Hall of the High Hunt .</p>
<p>After all was said and done, Ehamond was assigned to a different patrol leader of the Tomb Guard.</p>
