<p>Garion Linden was powerful and influential Tethyrian nobleman that lived in the kingdom during the early-to-mid 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He was married to Evonne Linden , the half-sister of Anais Rhindaun , heir to the throne of Tethyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>After Garion's death, some time around the Year of the Mages in Amber, 1466 DR , his loyal followers dedicated themselves to Evonne and her plot to become queen of Tethyr. In the years that followed, it was unclear exactly if Anais―who was next in the Line of Succession―or Evonne herself would ascend to the throne. Eventually, it was Anais who emerged victorious.</p>
<p>The Linden family's followers carried on Garion's legacy when they formed the Branch of Linden , following Evonne's apparent death in the Year of Splendors Burning, 1469 DR .</p>
