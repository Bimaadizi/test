<p>The Mist Runner was a worn tavern found along the waterfront of Immersea in Cormyr .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Mist Runner was a favored drinking and brawling spot for local fishermen. As such, much of the furniture had been destroyed and that which remained was nailed to the floor to prevent it from being thrown during a fisticuff. The windows of the tavern were long bereft of glass with only shutters to keep the weather at bay.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The Mist Runner was named for the local term for a smuggling ship.</p>
