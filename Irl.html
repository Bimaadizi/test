<p>Irl was a village that lay just west of the River Rith , due north of The Realm of the Mount . The village's main claim to fame was in the form of jewlers and their gems . Governmental rulings were made by the Eight-sided Stone , a covert council whose members were the elders of the most powerful Irlian families.</p>
<p>Irl had an inn called The Bold Ki-rin . It was a large, three-story, half-timbered mansion with many chimneys. The inn's dining room was famous for roasts, wines , and succulent sauces and its stables were second to none. The owner and keeper of the Rin was the jovial ex-adventurer Brelmere Baerith .</p>
<p>Where the village main street curved around the front of The Bold Ki-rin, there was a row of six well-established jewelry shops. The jewelers of Irl were reputed to be among the richest and most powerful humans in all Faer√ªn . They were secretive and reclusive and their behind-the-scenes influence could move merchants of Sembia , the Zulkirs of Thay and nobles of Waterdeep to do things they would rather not.</p>
