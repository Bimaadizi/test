<p>Gheris Hhune was a member of the Hhune patriar family of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>At some point in the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , Gheris Hhune became afflicted by lycanthropy , the affliction that led him into the servitude of the Kozakuran vampire Cazador Szarr , the lord of the Szarr Palace in Baldur's Gate. Along with Blaise Hhune , Duver Rillyn , and other werewolves , Gheris massacred a party of influential guests at the Szarr Palace, shortly before Cazador attempted to perform his ascension ritual. Gheris was guarding the passage past the massacre site to Cazador's dungeon, and sought to please his master and gain his favor. The beasts and lycanthropes were likely put out of their misery by the Absolute Adversaries and the vampire spawn Astarion Ancun√≠n .</p>
