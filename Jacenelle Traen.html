<p>Jacenelle Traen was a Chondathan human wilder who led the Stray Thoughts psionic mercenary adventuring company based in Selgaunt in Sembia in the 1370s DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Her role was to organize members of the Stray Thoughts to undertake missions, and she herself was away on activities half the time. She assigned prospective members to probationary missions. She would often manifest her psionic powers to aid members. She was eager to expand the organization, particularly outside Sembia, and would look for someone capable to establish a chapter house elsewhere.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Jacenelle's group was established and active by 1373 DR .</p>
<p>Around 1374 DR , the Stray Thoughts were engaged by a mysterious being called Z'dusk to hunt for a psionic artifact of unspecified nature and powers, for a 25,000 gp reward. (Unknown to them, it was buried in a sandy cave on Sembia's coast, and was in fact a lost fragment of an avatar of the illithid deity Ilsensine .)</p>
