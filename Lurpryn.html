<p>The Lurpryn family was one of the Onsruur —the council of twenty lords, each from a different prominent family—that held sway in Khôltar , south Faerûn , circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR .</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The Lurpryn were a handsome bloodline with dark skin, dark hair, and emerald -green eyes. They took their superior status very seriously: they never allowed anyone, commoner or elite, to see them doing anything resembling work; and they rarely showed more than casual interest in activities, trends, or ideas that were not their own. To outward appearances, this family epitomized sloth.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Behind closed doors, the Lurpryn were deep into the slave trade and had extensive investments in drug smugglers. They also kept thugs and assassins around for special jobs or hired them out. The most mundane of their financial interests was in rental property.</p>
