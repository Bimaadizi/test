<h2>History</h2>
<p>The amulets of vitality that circulated throughout the Sword Coast in the late 14 th century DR were copies of an infamous magic amulet from Sembia . These copies came from one necklace that was commissioned by a Sembian nobleman named Jacin Malts from an unnamed wizard . The petty lord ordered a sophisticated and tasteful amulet to improve his health, but once he put the amulet of vitality on, its gemstone turned bright red. That gaudy change angered the nobleman and he refused to pay the wizard, for which the spellcaster retaliated by destroying Jacin Malts with a single spell. Some time after that incident, the copies of these amulets were seen in Waterdeep , and from there they spread to Neverwinter , Daggerford , and other location on the Coast.</p>
