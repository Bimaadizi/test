<p>The Chariot of Re , which was also called the Chariot of Ra , was a powerful artifact that was constructed by an obcure god named Ptah .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The chariot was made from pure gold and emblazoned with the god Re 's symbol of a solar disc set against an ankh.</p>

<p>The Chariot of Re was capable of moving at great speed without the need for any animal to pull it. Anyone fighting from the chariot was extremely difficult to strike in combat because of the speed at which they moved.

<p>Anyone struck by someone riding in the chariot was blinded for 20–80 minutes. Viewing the chariot had positive effects for allies within 600 feet (180 meters), boosting their morale while having the opposite effect to enemies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Three of these chariots existed at one point—one for Ra, Horus-Re , and Osiris . The Chariot of Re was the only one known to exist following the Orcgate Wars .</p>
