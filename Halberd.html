<p>A halberd ( pronounced : /ˈ h ɑː l b ɛ r d / HAL-berd ) was a widely used member of the poleaxe family of polearms , that could best be described as somewhat of a cross between an axe and a spear .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The business end of a halberd consisted of three parts: the axe-head, the back spike or "fluke", and the spear tip that surmounted it. While many polearms had a similar structure, halberds had a few distinguishing features. Their axe-heads were concave (curving inward) to nearly straight, instead of convex like most axes. And were set at an angle to the shaft, instead of being mounted perpendicular.</p>
<p>The fluke of a halberd, which was fairly short and angled slightly downward, helped to balance the weapon. It was sometimes replaced by a hook for dismounting cavalry. The sharp spear-like spike that surmounted the fluke was usually of quadrangular design, but varied in length and size. Some were long and slender, while others were broader and of a medium length.</p>
<p>The average halberd measured 6​ to ​8 feet (1.8​ to ​2.4 meters) in length, or longer with their spear tips.</p>
<h2>Weaponology</h2>
<p>Halberds were extremely versatile against a wide range of opponents due to ability to unleash slashing, thrusting, tripping, or dismounting attacks. Dismounting in particular was a main function of the weapon. And were quite effective against plate armor . However, due to their size halberds were rather slow, unwieldy, and often considered detrimental in close quarters combat.</p>
<p>Halberdiers could attack the flanks of a pike formation with great effect, due to pikemen being unable to bring their much longer weapons to bear in close combat.</p>

<p>Prior to 1371 DR , the average halberd cost 10 gp and weighed 15 lb (6,800 g). After 1371 DR, and up to the Spellplague , the price of halberds remained the same, but weighed 12 lb (5,400 g).</p>
