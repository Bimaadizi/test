<p>The Temple of the Yuir Gods was an ancient temple found in the Yuirwood that was transported away from the Prime Material plane to the Feywild . It was a place of worship dedicated to the Yuir pantheon .</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The temple was formed out of group of trees that stood upon a hill in the Yuirwood.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The entrance hall of the temple was adorned with four, uniquely crafted, statues of the old Yuir gods: Elikarashae , Magnar the Bear, Zandilar the Dancer, and Relkath of the Infinite Branches . These statues appeared not be crafted from stone or metal, but rather grown upward from the temple's floor.</p>
<p>Just beyond the entranceway was the temple's ossuary. Within the heart of the temple was the thrice-twined tree.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Motes of light floated throughout the temple, providing ample illumination within.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>The star elves of the Yuirwood used the temple as a place of worship, but also as the holy site within which they could inter their dead.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time circa the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , the cult of Voldini uncovered the ancient fey document, the Tome of Twilight Boughs , which outlined a ritual that could bring back the temple to Toril. They had the ultimate goal of returning the Yuir pantheon to prominence in the Realms.</p>
<p>The cultists led by Berrain Truescourge ultimately proved successful in their efforts, and completed the ritual, inadvertently corrupting nearby fey, such as pixies and dryads , in the Yuirwood.</p>
<p>The same night the temple returned, a group of adventurers returned the temple to the Feywild and protected the fey of the Yuirwood from utter corruption. They accomplished this feat by implanting a crystal imbued life force of a noble fey that sacrificed their life, within the temple's thrice-twined tree.</p>
