<p>T'rachie's plate was a set of cursed plate mail armor that was crafted by the covetous Baron T'rachie .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>This armor possessed a powerful +5 enchantment but conferred a number of detriments to its wearer. When someone donned T'rachie's plate , they became much more frail and repellent to others they encountered.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The namesake armor of the elder Baron T'rachie, this armor was crafted at a time when the nobleman greatly desired the wife of one of his soldiers, Libol . T'rachie crafted the cursed plate mail and offered it to Libol as a gift. The married soldier could not remove the armor, due to its curse, and became horribly disfigured by its magical effects. The baron then reassigned Libol to a distant wasteland somewhere in the Realms in a campaign that saw constant battle against a band of marauding ogres .</p>
<p>Sometime following these events, T'rachie's plate appeared for sale within the Adventurer Mart , in the city of Athkatla , during the mid–14 th century DR .</p>
