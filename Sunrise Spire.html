<p>Sunrise Spire was a monastery dedicated to Lathander .</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>This monastery was located on the northern bank of the River Chionthar . It would take several days of upstream travel from Baldur's Gate to reach the site. The spire was located in a very strategic position, as the crossriver ferry was located very close by.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sunrise Spire was the first known location of the Tome of the Morning , a holy artefact of the Morninglord. However, this was not the actual origin of the tome, and it was likely secretly taken there. The presence of the book was made known by Brother Quitherus Ardabad in 1146 DR when adventurers of the Rose-Red Shield arrived at the Sunrise Spire seeking help. Sunrise Spire's First Prior was annoyed and disappointed that such a grand artefact had been kept at the Spire without him being informed. The First Prior did not think that the travelers were worthy enough to receive the tome. The Morninglord then directly manifested, and gave his support to Brother Quitherus instead of the First Prior. Lathander stated that the artefact was to travel to the "wilder places of Faerûn ".</p>
<p>Sometime later, the First Prior of Sunrise Spire was blown to ashes by his own altar. The Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Prior believed that the First Prior had turned away from their faith. These priors concluded that the First Prior had attempted to force Lathander to return the tome to Sunrise Spire. Quitherus Ardabad then left the Spire with the adventurers, tome in hand. On his journeys, he used the artefact to save several fighters and even recruited several novices to Lathander's cause.</p>
<p>In 1177 DR , several local upstart princes gathered their forces and waged a territorial war on one another. Sunrise Spire was destroyed in the process, mainly due to its strategic position.</p>
