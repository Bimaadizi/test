<p>The Kuangchiu Road (also spelled as the Kuang Chu Road ) was one of the great roads of Shou Lung , linking the empire overland to distant Koryo around 1357 DR .</p>
<p>It began near the city of Chaoyang in Chukei Province of Shou Lung. Here the Kuangchiu Road joined the Spice Road , which ran west and south; some considered the south-running Spice Road in Ma' Yuan Province part of the Kuangchiu Road. Chaoyang maintained a border garrison to guard this junction.</p>
<p>Running north, it passed through Kangste , the major trade town on the Kuangchiu Road.</p>
<p>Beyond this point, on maps, the road disappeared into the Koryaz Mountains . It presumably ran through the mountains, the vast Ama Basin lands, around and down through the Koryo Peninsula , and finally ended in Koryo. [ speculation ]</p>
