<p>Netheril was the name used by a wizard of Freedale town in the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>He was old and bearded.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>He was stuck-up, and really did not care for getting pushed around by anyone.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>High Wizard Netheril was quite powerful, almost certainly far more than the adventurers he employed.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His abode was a tower in Freedale where he kept no end of trinkets and books. Sometimes, he carried some minor magic he could sell, such as a spell scroll , a dozen enchanted arrows, or a potion of giant strength , speed , invisibility , or fire resistance .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>He was willing to identify magical devices for a fee and sometimes he sold enchanted wares, but did not offer many other services.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The man was attended by three warriors: his manservant Major Domo , and the guards Fortu , and Deval . The elf Taran Goldenstar was his apprentice.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the mid-to-late 14 th century DR , High Mage Netheril's apprentice Taran Goldenstar left for the Tomb of Damara , seeking an orb that an ogre was close to obtaining. After two days, Taran had not returned; the wizard had the town crier call for adventurers in Freedale. He later recruited a party, most likely made up of Slinker , Delvar Ironfist , Lordan the Pure, Morganth the Mysterious, Beldar the Brave, and Silverleaf Halfmoon to find his apprentice Taran Goldenstar in the Tomb of Damara. He intended to pay 100 gold pieces , but may have paid up to twice that.</p>
<p>After the adventurers rescued Taran, if they returned to town, Netheril appealed to their sense of justice to stop the ogre Bonegnasher , who was close to attaining the orb of dragonkind , according to the elf's report. If the adventurers accepted, and returned with the orb , then Netheril almost certainly destroyed it.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>To the adventurers, Netheril was too mighty in magic for any real contest. However, to Taran, he was too old to adventure.</p>
