<p>The Conclave of Silverymoon (also called the University of Silverymoon ) was a great university of magic and a center of learning and wisdom in the city of Silverymoon , created by Alustriel Silverhand as one of her last acts as High Mage.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Conclave of Silverymoon taught all manners and " schools " of magic and knowledge related to magic. Individual colleges within the university system focused on particular specialties.</p>
<p>The university did not have a single location in the city, but its individual institutions were found on both sides of the River Rauvin . However, several of the schools were clustered together in a Southbank campus, where fourteen buildings were originally set aside for university use. These buildings included the original locations of the Lady's College and Miresk's School of Thaumaturgy .</p>
<p>The university was in part funded by Alustriel herself, who sponsored promising students' tuition and the private research projects of various faculty members. It also received financial support from the Spellguard , and new recruits to the group were often required to attend and given tuition discounts.</p>
<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>At the university's founding, the wizard Eltro Miresk was appointed Magus Senior, director of the entire university. while Arkhen the Icy was named Magus Invoker and head of the Invocation School .</p>
