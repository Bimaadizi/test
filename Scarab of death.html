<p>Scarabs of death were deadly enchanted items that appeared harmless at first glance.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Scarabs of death appeared indistinguishable from mundane or magical amulets , brooches, or scarabs.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>If a scarab of death was touching warm living flesh, placed in a bag or a similar container, worn on clothes, or simply kept within 1 foot (0.3 meters) from a warm living creature for between 1 and 10 minutes, the item's enchantment became obvious. A scarab of death transformed into a deadly flesh-burrowing insect that chewed and tore through the target's leather armor , clothes, and body moving towards the heart. It took 1 to 10 minutes for the monster to reach the target's heart and kill them. After the target's death, a scarab of death transformed back into its inert form.</p>
<p>Scarabs of death could be safely kept in containers made of thick wood , ceramic , ivory , or metal. Undead creatures could safely wear these pieces of jewelry as cold dead bodies did not trigger the deadly magics.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>Scarabs of death could be created by experienced magic item crafters with the use of the slay living spell .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Aragath , a lich priest of Talos who laired underneath Jathrin's Jump guarded his underground temple with six golems . Each was outfitted with numerous magic items, including scarabs of death .</p>
