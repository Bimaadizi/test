<p>Makbulla bint Dalmar was a dwarf trader who frequented Huzuz , the City of Delights, in 1367 DR .</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>Though she posed as a trader, Makbulla was in fact a dangerous pirate who sailed the Golden Gulf in search of prey on her sambuk , The North Wind's Fury . Her favorite hunting grounds were near the Pearl Cities and the League of the Pantheon . The waters of the Sea of Caravans were too heavily patrolled for her taste.</p>
<p>Makbulla often resupplied in Huzuz. She also recruited new members to sail with her, preferring dwarves but taking other races if they seemed like a good fit.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>

<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Makbulla possessed a set of bracers of defense +2 , a Cutlass of the Golden Gulf , a dagger and jambiya , two throwing axes , and a potion of heroism .</p>
