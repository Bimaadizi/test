<p>Khampo was a city in Tabot .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>It stood amongst the forest in southern Tabot, north of the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains , on the road between Thok and Pabex and at the end of the road from Bidnop So . It was roughly a day's ride from Thok.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , Baron Phen Do of Khampo rebelled against the government of Tabot. In response, the worried Mag-chi Le-Khung (the military office) stationed three divisions in Khampo to contain the revolt. In Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) , a tortoise-shell divination at U'Chan Gompa suggested burning rocks would fall on Khampo during Qwa'chein Goh celebrations; they elected not to warn the city, as punishment for its rebellion. Despite this, that same year, in response to a Phutanese army assembling at the border, Tabot went on a war footing, with the Mag-chi Le-Khung mustering soldiers in the area. They ordered conscription in Bidnop So, Darka , Thok, and Khampo. In short, it was not a good year for the people of Khampo.</p>
