<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The Sea of Caravans was an important body of water connecting trade and commerce between Qudra and the Free Cities of Zakhara in the north with the Cities of the Heart in the southeast. Both the Mountains of the Lizard's Tongue and the Spine of the Dog created steep borders along the entire stretch of the sea's western and southern boundaries.</p>

<p>Travel by ship through the sea bypassed hundreds, if not thousands of miles, of perilous desert travel. The Sea of Caravans, Al-Tariq Channel , and Suq Bay were constantly patrolled by the Grand Caliph 's warships to ensure safe travel for traders and pilgrims.</p>
