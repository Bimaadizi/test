<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Glowworms were tiny insects that created enough light, when assembled together, to read in the darkness or illuminate the area of 5 feet (1.5 meters) with gentle dim light.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Glowworms were fairly common insects and were collected to be sold living or dead. They used their light to attract flies, which they consumed.</p>
<p>An edible species of glowworm native to the Underdark was collected for culinary use by drow and other subterranean humanoids .</p>
<p>Glowworms could be found inside the mega dungeon, Undermountain under Waterdeep . The city of Skullport held swarms of glowworms in braziers to illuminate the streets.</p>
<p>Ulgarthan glowworms emitted brighter mauve-hued dim light than their Sword Coast cousins. One living glowworm per jar was enough to be used for lighting purposes.</p>
<p>Glowworms from the caves of Calimshan were known to emit greenish white lights. They covered the ceilings like stars, flickering when one of them caught a midge.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
