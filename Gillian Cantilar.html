<p>Gillian Cantilar was the half-elven ranger who dwelt on the top of the hill that later became the hamlet of Gillian's Hill and was the town's namesake.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Gillian Cantilar was said to be a creature of great beauty.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Long before 14 th century DR , Gillian lived in a lone house atop the wooded mound at the northern edge of the area that eventually became known as Gillian's Hill. The ranger was considered a hero and defender by merchants who traveled along the Trade Way . Gillian was one of the very few who set out to spy on local bandits, poachers, and make sure caravans remained unspoiled by the many dangers of the road.</p>
<p>Eventually, the area of the ranger's razed home was taken by the elevated fire cairn, used to warn Daggerford of encroaching enemy armies of Dragonspear Castle and Serpent Hills . However, the makeshift tower was often used as a flophouse for various unsavory elements. In 1372 DR , a group known as the Gillian's Hill Gang was occupying the spot while targeting passing traders and merchants.</p>
