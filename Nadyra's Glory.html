<p>Nadyra's Glory (also known as the Lost Princess ) was the bridal ship of Princess Aliia of Impiltur . which sank in mysterious circumstances on the Sea of Fallen Stars in 926 DR after leaving Hlammach .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This ship displayed purple sails in honor of the kingdom of Cormyr.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>When Nadyra's Glory set sail from Hlammach in 926 DR it was loaded with treasure and its aim was to unite Cormyr and Impiltur through Aliia's marriage to Crown Prince Rhiigard I of Cormyr . However, the ship ultimately sank about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off its course, on a direct line between Tsurlagol and Wayrock .</p>
<p>The wreck came to rest on its right side, and was quickly scavenged of its valuables by nearby undersea creatures, including koalinths and scrags . Amongst the treasures on board were the Greatsword of Impiltur , Kimeltaar the Demonsbane Shield, and the Crowns of Whispers . It was looted, at least in part, by the succubus demon lord Soneillon .</p>
<p>In the four centuries following its sinking, many a sailors and pirates spoke of having seen Nadyra's Glory as a ghost ship off the coast of Impiltur. There sightings always occurred between at early morning between Tsurlagol and Lyrabar . They spoke of the ship's presence being preceded by a fog rolling in, followed by the scent of violets and a ghostly woman (believed to be Aliia) sobbing loudly as she plucks at the strings of a small harp . Finally, another ship bearing a purple sail would appear alongside it and they would proceed to either exit the fog or disappear as the fog was cleared away by the sun .</p>
<p>The sightings of the Nadyra's Glory ghost ship came to be considered an ill omen, though at the same time many pitied the cursed state of the ship and its passenger.</p>
