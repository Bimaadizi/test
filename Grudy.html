<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1369 DR, Leutnant Grudy was under pressure from Brigadier Helmhorn over the members of the Sisterhood of Silver Fire who opposed the Cult of the Dragon's operations in Myth Drannor. The women, referred to as "fire witches", became a thorn in the Cult's side, provoking the ire of its leader, Kya Mordrayn . Helmhorn tasked Grudy to capture the Mystran clerics or have his bulbous nose sliced off.</p>
