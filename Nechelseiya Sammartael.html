<h2>Description</h2>
<p>She was heavily scented.</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Her husband was a rich man.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>She had a habit of buying things from the alchemist at late hours in the afternoon, and was known for her gossip being bad for business.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On the eve of the Council of the Dragon , Nechelseiya Sammartael spent a late evening in Immaero Sraunter 's apothecary, sampled sixteen vials of perfume and bought only an old ointment. The man had to get out of bed to attend to her purchase. Sraunter's guest, the evil vampire archmage Manshoon , took note of that.</p>
<h2>Rumors & Legends</h2>
<p>Manshoon made it a running joke of reminding Sraunter of Nechelseiya Sammartael. Sraunter eventually got so overworked by Manshoon, he became concerned that she might get in his back rooms if he didn't keep watch.</p>
