<p>The Circus of Doctor Trundles was a circus, run by Dr. Trundles and Tanaroo Quinson , that traveled Impiltur and Damara with a collection of monsters in the midâ€“14 th century DR .</p>

All monsters except the bulette were recaptured, as the bulette went on to terrorize Halfling Downs in Carmathan for the next two years. While only minor losses were inflicted on Valls, the disaster damaged the circus's reputation. Trundles handed the reins of ringmaster to Tanaroo Quinson and stepped back to a less-active role. The circus moved south to Impiltur in effort to rebuild the circus's reputation and business.
