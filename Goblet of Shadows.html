<p>The Goblet of Shadows was a tavern in Nethra during the midâ€“8 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The place was a maze of arches, beaded curtains, and tables. There were also pillars.</p>
<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Goblet was a shady place, where bar fights drew not just bets, but thrown bottles from strangers, and death screams did not disrupt activities, instead drawing applause. Bizarrely, it was not even the wildest tavern in the city.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The place served alcohol, including heartsfire , and had dancing ladies.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>One evening in the late Year of Mistmaidens, 764 DR , shortly before the invasion of Nethra by the Lords of Laothkund , the guards Delver and Ingrath were approached by Queen Dasumia of Galadorna , who was at the moment posing as one of the tavern dancers. She revealed her identity to the guards and proposed they go somewhere more private. This was witnessed by the scholars Tabarast and Beldrune , who were drinking at the time; the trio was also followed by the wandering elven mage Ilbryn Starym .</p>
