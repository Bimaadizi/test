<p>Chronos was an ancient deity , the god of time, ironically lost to the ages. Religious texts and ancient histories spoke of him in passing. He was known to have been worshiped by the nation of Orva but it was unknown how he died. Shrines of Chronos still held power millennia later. Offerings would crumble to dust in mere seconds and in return, the offeror received a vision of the past or the future.</p>
<p>Statues of Chronos depicted him as a tall man in a hooded robe with feathered wings, holding a scythe and an hourglass .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
