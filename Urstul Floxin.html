<p>Urstul Floxin ( pronounced : /ˈ ɜːr s t uː l ˈ f l ɒks ɪ n / UR-stool FLOX-in ) was a high-ranking member of the Zhentarim in Waterdeep in the early 1490s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1492 DR , Urstul Floxin was the leader of the Zhents headquartered in the villa of the Gralhund family. From there, he directed the search for the Stone of Golorr , which was in possession of the gnome Dalakhar .</p>
<p>However, not fully trusting Urstul, Yalah Gralhund also sent one of her personal servants, a nimblewright with a necklace of fireballs , to search for the rock gnome . Floxin and two of his minions managed to ambush Dalakhar but then a fireball launched by the nimblewright killed the rock gnome and ten more people, including the two Zhent minions. Despite some injuries, Urstul survived and finally took the Stone .</p>
<p>Then, finally in possession of the Stone , Urstul went to question Yalah about the nimblewright. However, she took advantage of his injures and took the Stone , triggering the events of the confrontation later known as the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath .</p>
<p>Urstul was confined in the villa's parlor but managed to kill the guards and escaped.</p>
<p>Next, he tried to find Lord Orond Gralhund , who was hidden in one of the guest rooms, with a plan to capture and trade him to get back the Stone . There Urstul was possibly confronted and defeated by some adventurers.</p>
<p>If he survived, Urstul retreated to Kolat Tower with his master Manshoon .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Urstul was truly loyal to Manshoon, even after being punished. He was a charming and dangerous individual.</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>
<p>Urstul received his orders directly from a simulacrum of Manshoon. He had a collection of black flying snakes that he used as couriers.</p>
