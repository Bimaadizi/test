<p>Fazes were massive, rare aberrations known to live in the Astral Plane .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fazes resembled jellyfish, with translucent, purplish domes concealing the internal organs, and six white tentacles hanging below. The skin was tough and rubbery. Fazes were typically considered exotically beautiful when seen from a distance.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Fazes were, unfortunately, evil creatures that preferred to attack good creatures.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Fazes' most dangerous ability was how they fed and what they ate, for they drained intelligence from sentient creatures within 50 feet (15 meters). This draining was not easily noticeable by most creatures. If a creature passed out because of the drain, fazes were known to eat their victims.</p>
<p>Fazes were also capable of of the psionic powers daze monster , feather fall , and shatter , each usable thrice per day.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Fazes preferred to feed on good creatures, but if they went a week or more without eating, they would attack any sentient creature. However, since their intelligence drain was not always noticed by their victims, fazes preferred to eat without actually entering combat. If their feeding continued to go unnoticed, they would eat more than strictly necessary until their victims fell unconscious. If it was noticed, however, and the faze was threatened, it would retreat as soon as it was full.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Fazes were found, though rarely, in the Astral Plane, but it was unknown whether they were actually native to that plane. There they drifted along in search of food and nothing more, much like oceanic jellyfish. They were not known to speak, not even telepathically like other psionic aberrations. They preyed upon any creatures they ran across; consequently, githyanki would kill fazes on sight.</p>
<p>For an unknown reason, fazes congregated near Crosswinds Keep , whose inhabitants kept them away with spells and siege weapons.</p>
