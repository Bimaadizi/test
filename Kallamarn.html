<p>Kallamarn was a small farming village in southern Cormyr on the north bank of the Starwater River by the 1360s DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Kallamarn was named for one of its early settlers.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>Nearby towns included Hilp to the northwest, Gladehap to the northeast, and Nesmyth to the east.</p>
<p>The part of the Starwater where Kallamarn was situated was an area of rapids. A towpath (walkway) along the bank allowed those on land to pull barges past the rapids, or anchor them with ropes to large wooden tripods.</p>
<h2>Trade</h2>
<p>An apple orchard was located along the river. It grew large, tart, green apples called Kallamarn Catsheads , which were sold in Suzail and were used to make pies. When the orchard was abandoned, the apples were free for the taking, but every year a few unfortunate pickers lost their lives when they were grabbed by kelpies and dragged down into the water.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>Kallamarn was the birthplace of Lucas Surin , a captain in the Purple Dragons . He was commissioned by Elminster to write an ecology book about the coastal areas of Cormyr and Sembia on the Sea of Fallen Stars .</p>
