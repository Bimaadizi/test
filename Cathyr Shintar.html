<h3>Rise to Power</h3>
<p>Cathtyr Shintar, along with a large group of fellow priestesses, appeared to come to the rescue of Reinhar IX while he was corned by drow in the city of Malduir .</p>
<p>Cathtyr offered the support of her priestesses. Reinhar IX believed this to be a sign from the gods and had a priestess assigned to each of his remaining companies. When the drow attacked, the priestesses within each company betrayed the Arkaiuns . Cathtyr slew Reinhar IX herself during the betrayal.</p>
<p>The drow, weakened by decades of war, realized their victory was only possible because of the aid from Cathtyr's priestesses. Cathtyr recognized an opportunity and made a deal with the drow that her group of priestesses would rule the surface land of Dambrath in exchange for free trade with the drow.</p>
<p>Tired from war, and having no interested in the surface territory, the drow gladly agreed. The drow departed, taking the best Arkaiun males as their slaves.</p>

The worship of ancient beastlords by the Arkaiun was all but wiped out. Small groups of Arkaiun were able to escape to the Swagdar where the resumed their nomadic lifestyle.</p>
<p>Cathtyr was killed by her daughter, Filina Shintar in the Year of Falling Stars, 1035 DR .</p>
<h3>Interbreeding</h3>
