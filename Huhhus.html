<p>Huhhus was the Red Wizard made famous for discovering a recipe for potion of regeneration long before the 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many years before the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR , a lowly Red Wizard of Thay named Huhhus found a way to perfectly distill a troll 's flesh into a concoction that granted the imbibers the regenerative abilities of a troll. Few people were willing to drink the foul distillate despite the unarguable usefulness. Decades later, one of Huhhus's students used the Red Wizard's method and found a way to imbue a troll's regenerative abilities onto a magic ring . The secret was to fill a hollow cavity inside a jade ring with ichor and the brains of a troll.</p>
