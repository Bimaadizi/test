<p>Old Ornar's Beds and Tables was a furniture shop in Sundabar , owned and run by the elderly master-woodworker, Ornar Myntul , in the 14 th century DR .</p>
<p>From his shop, Ornar would import and sell master-crafted beds and tables, albeit at a much more reasonable price. While a particularly plain piece would sell for about 30 gp and an elaborate canopied bed would fetch several thousand, most of Ornar's pieces cost less than 8 gp , while his most expensive bed was 18 gp.</p>
