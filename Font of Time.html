<p>The Font of Time was a powerful artifact from the Old Empires that displayed life in Mulhorand during the height of their power.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The fountain was pearl -white and contained within a white crystal. The Font would appear on the sands at undertermined intervals.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When looking into the waters of the Font of Time during a full moon, a viewer would witness scenes from Mulhorand 's history that appeared to be real. Gazing into the mystic waters for too long actually pulled the viewer back in time to live in ancient Mulhorand during the height of its power. The only way for the viewer to find their way back to their own time period was to discover the Font of Time in the ancient time period and gaze into its waters again.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Little information was known about the Font of Time save that it was located somewhere in eastern Mulhorand. Some writings about the Font were discovered in Nezram 's book entitled Unique Mageries .</p>
