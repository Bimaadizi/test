<p>Mama Falice was a refugee guest of Nortale's Hostel in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Falice was a human woman with a light skin tone, mousy light brown hair, and dark brown eyes. She wore the humble garb of a commoner.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR , as the Absolute crisis ravaged the Western Heartlands , the city of Baldur's Gate became flooded with refugees. Mama Falice and her family were lucky enough to secure lodgings at Nortale's Hostel, which offered beds to the refugees but had very limited capacity. As the conflict continued to ravage the Chionthar Valley , Falice lamented the events that led her family into Baldur's Gate and often missed fresh air, being cooped up in a crowded hostel.</p>
