<p>Feyduster was a variety of enchanted short swords created on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 th century DR , with the original being the masterwork of the evil enchanter Nolls 's twisted mind.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>There existed three variants of Feydusters , each possessing +1 , +2 , or +8 enchantments what made the sword 's edge deadlier and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. All three versions could affect the target with the sleep spell on a successful attack.</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>A Feyduster could be created from a simple enchanted short sword and a vial of pixie dust .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The very first and powerful version of a Feyduster was created by Nolls. The evil enchanted used pixie dust harvested from crushed and mutilated pixies to weave the sleep magics into the short sword. However, druids claimed that it was the death screams of tortured pixies that sounded in the sword's targets' heads was what rendered them unconscious and not sleep magic.</p>
<p>More common versions of Fey Dusters with a simpler +1 enchantment were forged by Master Blacksmith Marrok of the Shining Knight Arms and Armor shop in Neverwinter to help the heroes who sought the cure for the dreaded Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR . Later the same year, more powerful versions were created by Master Blacksmith Barun of Beorunna's Well to help the forces of Neverwinter stand against Lady Aribeth the Betrayer , who led a marching army of Luskan in the deadly but short-lived Neverwinter-Luskan war.</p>
