<h2>History</h2>
<p>Some time during the late 15 th century DR , Syndrith and her Deathweavers came into the possession of dark ritual that they sought to perform on behalf of their goddess Lolth . They began by creating some sort of interconnected energy field over the village of Rothé Valley , as part of Sarkon'Iss ' expedition to found the above-ground outpost of "New Xorlarrin", in order to control the wild arcane energy let loose by the Spellplague and shape it into a reformed version of the Weave that could be controlled by Lolth herself.</p>
<p>While the formation of New Xorlarrin and the drow Deathweavers were thwarted by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge , Syndrith continued their work at the Temple of the Spider within the Underdark. The hero and their adventuring party ventured into the Shallows beneath Rothé Valley , and stormed the temple, slaying Syndrith and preventing the perversion of the Weave that bound arcane magic on Toril .</p>
