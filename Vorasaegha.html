<h2>History</h2>
<p>Vorasaegha was a female bronze dragon in past ages prior to her death. Her spirit however continued to wander the forest she loved.</p>
<p>In 1373 DR, in a desperate effort to destroy a Cult of the Dragon hideout hidden in the Gray Forest, the avariel Taegan Nightwind , leader of the remaining Impilturan troops, and the faerie dragon Jivex evoked Vorasaegha, who incarnated herself in a bronze dragon . In that form, she attacked the cultists and entered into combat with the green dragon dracolich leader. The dracolich eventually found a way to expel the guardian spirit. However, the significant damage that the bronze dragon had inflicted allowed Taegan, Jivex, and the Impilturans to destroy the evil creature.</p>
