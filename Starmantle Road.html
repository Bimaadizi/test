<p>The adventuring party known as the Frostfire Banner was ambushed by the Slayer in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm, 767 DR , when they sought to stop it on behalf of High Duke Horostos , not a day away from Starmantle. At that time, the area appeared to be clear of deer, fox, and hare, and the Slayer had already been the alleged reason for the disappearance of a number of travelers using the road, including passing merchants, woodcutters, farmers, livestock, the Duke's men-at-arms, and even a powerful cleric of Tempus traveling with a full retinue of warriors.</p>
