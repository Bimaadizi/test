<p>Samark Dhanzscul was the sixth Blackstaff .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Samark had three parallel scars on his face from his right cheekbone to his jaw. In 1479 DR , he was described as an old man. He wore no beard.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Samark was kind and respectful towards people regardless of their status. He always used the given names of the people he interacted with, rather than just their surnames.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Samark was the apprentice and heir of Ashemmon of Rhymanthiin , the fifth Blackstaff. He became Blackstaff in 1464 DR , after the death of Ashemmon.</p>
<p>When Vajra Safahr came to Waterdeep to learn magic, she met Samark, and after some time, Samark became her mentor and lover, despite her youth. She became the Blackstaff's Heir.</p>
<p>Samark was murdered by Centiv Naomal , the son of his rival Khondar Naomal , on Marpenoth 20 , 1479 DR . They murdered him and kidnapped and tortured Vajra as part of their plot to obtain access to Blackstaff Tower and rule the city. Centiv proceeded to impersonate Samark in public for nearly two months, but whenever he was found out, he used magic to prevent people from revealing the truth.</p>
<p>After Samark's death, his "template of spirit" (his knowledge and intellect) joined the rest of the Blackstaffs as part of Blackstaff Tower.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Samark carried a staff known as the Duskstaff , which may have been an iteration of the actual Blackstaff . The Duskstaff had a twisted metal staff with a crystal on top that flashed various colors.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Samark and Vajra Safahr were publicly known to be lovers.</p>
<p>Samark had a long-standing rivalry with Khondar "Ten-Rings" Naomal, the guildmaster of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors , mainly based on the fact that Khondar wished to be the Blackstaff.</p>
