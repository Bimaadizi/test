<p>Inupras was the capital of the Imaskari Empire between −7975 DR and −6422 DR , and again between −3920 DR and −2488 DR . It housed the Palace of the Purple Emperor , the residence of the Lord Artificer of Imaskar.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>At the time of its construction, Inupras stood on a plain. However, after −2488 DR, the surrounding region had become the Raurin Desert .</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>While the Imperial City was razed in −2488 DR, the Palace of the Purple Emperor survived the battles, most likely because of powerful wards.</p>
<p>Imaskari cities were often built of a purple stone from the Raurin mountains, which was naturally extremely resilient. The Imaskari artificers were known for their use of portals and extradimensional spaces, which were a common means of transportation in their cities, as well as tactically exploited.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Inupras was established as the capital of the Imaskari Empire by Lord Umyatin when he ascended to the throne as Lord Artificer in −7975 DR, and it continued to be the capital until −6422 DR, when it was razed by rampaging krakentuas that emerged from the Temple of the Gaping Maw in the middle of the city; because of the location, public opinion blamed the Cult of Demogorgon . This event would precipitate the split into Upper and Lower Imaskar.</p>
<p>It was refounded by Lord Omanond in −3920 DR during the reunification of Upper and Lower Imaskar, which prompted the Late period of the empire. It remained the capital until −2488 DR, when it was destroyed during the fight between the Imaskari artificers and the gods of the Mulan .</p>
