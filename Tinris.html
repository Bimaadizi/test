<p>Tinris ("Glitteredges" in Espruar ) was an ancient, enchanted main-gauche that was typically wielded alongside an equally ancient enchanted sabre known as Kirquare .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tinris shared a visual design with Kirquare . This included having a blade forged of everbright steel and an exquisitely designed basket hilt, with idyllic woodland scenes carved from their quillons down to their pommels. Their grips were covered in a red leather that seemed impervious to stains and wear. And their pommels bore the image of a laughing fey 's head, with a tongue protruding out to form the hilt and ending wrapped around the blade's base.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>Tinris was a weapon of skewering , meaning that it could ignore any +1 or higher protective enchantments on any armor it struck. It also had a unique ability to deflect spells , having them rebound in a random direction, though once that was done once the wielder could not use any of its other powers for over a minute. When wielded alongside Kirquare , the main-gauche took on an effect similar to a sword of speed .</p>
<p>Wielding Tinris also enabled one to cast the spells clairaudience three times per day out to a range of 20 ft (6.1 m), detect magic once per minute, detect evil and good once per minute, and teleport . The teleport could only be cast once per day and the user could only teleport up to 600 pounds (270 kilograms).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The exact age and creator of Tinris and Kirquare were both lost to time. They appeared several times throughout the ages, as far back as the dawn of elven history. One legend even claimed that the blades were once wielded by Eldron Collodae , an avatar of Erevan Ilesere , the elven god of mischief and rogues .</p>
<p>By the late 14 th century DR , the two blades that somehow found their way into the possession of The Smiling Viper , a legendary and enigmatic moon elf rogue.</p>
