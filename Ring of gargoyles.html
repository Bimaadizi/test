<p>A ring of gargoyles was a magic item capable of summoning gargoyles .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These items were usually made from brass .</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>These rings could summon one or two gargoyles from within the ring to the wearer's aid. The ring could also repel gargoyles. Using any of these functions caused physical harm to the wearer which could be recovered through rest or healing.</p>
<p>The summoned gargoyles were utterly loyal to the wearer and obeyed telepathic commands. The telepathic link also protected both the wearer and gargoyles from charm , hold , sleep , and suggestion spells and illusions . The wearer could view the world through the gargoyle's eyes, including using their infravision . The wearer's control of the creatures extended to a distance of 100 mi (160 km) provided they were on the same plane of existence .</p>
<p>The gargoyles could only be summoned once per day. They would vanish if slain and were unavailable to be summoned again. A ring of gargoyles could only summon six different gargoyles and crumbled to dust when the last one was killed. Injured gargoyles could return to the ring to heal.</p>
<p>A rare version of this ring existed called a ring of margoyles which functioned in the same manner but summoned a single powerful margoyle . The summoned margoyle would grow stronger with each enemy that it killed. In exchange for its freedom, the margoyle would grant the wearer one limited wish .</p>
<h2>Notable Owners</h2>
<p>Kylia , a gnome illusionist from Skullport , wore a ring of gargoyles .</p>
