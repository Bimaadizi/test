<h2>History</h2>
<p>Sometime prior to the late 1470s DR, Captain Blau claimed to have witnessed a ship be burned and sunk by fire nagas off the east coast of the isle of Moray . In his account, these nagas appeared as human -headed snakes who hunted through the wreckage for survivors and tore them apart. This was a tale he once told to Lukas , captain of the Sphinx , while drunk in Callidyrr .</p>
