<p>" Einheriar " (also spelled Einherjar ) was a collective term for any army of the spirits of fallen humanoid warriors. Also known as spirit legions , einheriar were not undead ; they were once-mortal petitioners specially chosen to serve in the armies of the Outer Planes , most commonly in the Upper Planes . They were numbered among the Celestials .</p>
<p>The term, which translated as "faithful", properly and most commonly referred to the noble warriors of Asgard , who served Odin ; however, over time, it also came to be used for the formerly mortal armies of other planes , such as those of Arcadia or the dwarven hosts of Clangeddin Silverbeard . Some of the powers of the Faerûnian pantheon had einheriar in their service, including Ilmater . In the Netherese pantheon , both Mystryl and Tyche were served by them. Eilistraee , goddess of the good drow , also had a host of einheriar. Einheriar loyal to Indra of the Lords of Creation were also known to serve the deity in the homonymous layer of Limbo .</p>
<p>The word was also used in the singular to refer to an individual member of the einheriar.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Einheriar were described as wispy in form, including their armor and weapons. The majority of einheriar were once human , and they still looked similar in appearance to the persons they once were in life.</p>
<p>Einheriar were suited in the highest quality of armor, usually with a design that hinted at the god or goddess whom they served. Rarely, their armor had minor magical enhancements.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Einheriar were wholly obedient to the powers or proxies who commanded them, faithfully following their orders with great fervor.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Einheriar were among the toughest examples of their former race. They were exceptionally fleet of foot. They also had minor resistance to magical spells , and most were immune to fear. Sometimes, the deity who commanded the einheriar would grant them additional powers.</p>
<p>The greatest among them were powerful enough to be considered quasi-deities . Such individuals were impossible to polymorph and were immune to mind-affecting maladies and magics that would drain their essence or abilities. They were strongly resistant to fire , to spells, and to physical attacks from all but the most powerful of magic weapons.</p>
<p>Einheriar were immortal. If they were killed, they would simply return to life again after a short time to fight another day.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dwarven einheriar from Mount Clangeddin in Arcadia frequently entered Acheron to battle in epic array against the evil forces there.</p>
<p>The einheriar of Asgard resided in Odin's feasting hall of Valhalla , waiting for the great battle of Ragnarok. Einheriar in service of Sharindlar were also known to inhabit the Merciful Court , her divine realm in Nidavellir .</p>
<p>Elven high mages had developed an epic spell to summon an army of einheriar to defend their homelands.</p>
<h2>Society</h2>
<p>When encountered on the planes, einheriar could be found in patrols numbering from 10 to 100 persons, marching in military units. These patrols usually included a majority of fighters , but other classes of warriors were among their numbers as well in smaller percentages. According to estimates as few as 10% and as many as 20% were divine spellcasters, while from only about 3% to as many as 15% were arcane casters. These were the roles that each warrior once held in life, and each recalled the full extent of his or her training and combat skills as a mortal.</p>
<p>There was no hierarchy among their ranks. All einheriar were equals, subservient to their commanding power or proxy.</p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
<p>As spiritual creatures, einheriar did not need to eat to survive.</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>They respected other celestial beings as aasimon and archons , but they worked independently of them. Einheriar received their instructions from the powers through prayer.</p>
<p>Among the Morndinsamman they acted as servants of the deities Berronar Truesilver , Clangeddin Silverbeard , Dugmaren Brightmantle , Gorm Gulthyn , Haela Brightaxe , Moradin , Sharindlar , and Thard Harr . The goddess Lliira particularly favored as divine servants einheriar who were once partiers or pranksters in their mortal lives.</p>
