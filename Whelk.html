<p>Whelks were spelljammer ships, grown instead of built, that appeared as spiraled seashells traveling with the opening in front.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Whelks were grown by gnomes with a design based on seashells, with sharp spikes along the mouths of the shells. They had jettisons mounted in the narrow aft, and catapults atop the shell's thickest point. Being created by gnomes for gnomes, everything were gnome-sized, such that most humans or similar sized people found them quite uncomfortable.</p>
<h2>Crew</h2>
<p>The entire command staff were gnome illusionists and a few crewmembers were illusionists too. These gnomes were great at using their magic to make these ships appear far more dangerous than they actually were, projecting visions of monstrous creatures manning the decks, flaming projectiles on the catapult and such. One favorite trick they used was to halt the ship, then create hallucinatory terrain around it, thus rendering it near-invisible as long as it remained stationary.</p>
