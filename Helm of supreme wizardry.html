<p>A helm of supreme wizardry was a Netherese artifact that enhanced the powers of wizards.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>They were ornate fluted helms made of steel plated with an alloy of silver . While remaining sallet-style, the helms altered to fit the head of anyone who donned them.</p>
<h2>Powers</h2>
<p>When wearing such a helmet, a wizard could memorize at least two, and at most eight extra spells, depending on the tiers of spells they had already achieved. The artifact's additional spells were only from the uppermost tiers, and many wizards might not ever cast such a spell in their lifetimes. The additional spells memorized had to be spent within 12 hours, or else they were lost; their unleashing caused some severe damage to their user.</p>
<p>However, there was a severe risk of burnout; if used more than twice in a tenday , the helmet permanently impaired the user's intelligence and health. If used twice within the same month, no spell memorized the second time could be of the same schools to which spells memorized the first time had belonged; if so, the target suffered an even more severe decay of their mental faculties and health.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Dating back to the golden age of Netheril , the helmets were invented by the Terraseer , and allowed their users to recapture the power of the great arcanists of that age. But it came with drawbacks and allowed them to test their restraint and wisdom.</p>
<p>Between 1367 DR and 1372 DR , Raulothim was known to have sought one, expecting they'd aid him in casting stasis clone .</p>
<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>Few learned sages knew they were Netherese artifacts, but fewer still knew they exacted a terrible price from those who employed their powers anything other than very sparsely. Almost none knew of their creator, but those who did were also informed that the helmet's most famous users had disappeared suddenly in turn, suggesting he was testing them for some purpose.</p>
<p>The dragon Raulothim had read in records from Myth Drannor that such artifacts allowed a mage to employ spells beyond their ken. It was thought that Lady Gemcloak, the dragon Saryndalaghlothtor , could do this with her own helm of supreme wizardry .</p>
