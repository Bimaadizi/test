<p>Eternal Flame Klanak Famouth was the high priest at the Burning House of Kossuth in Tyraturos , the most influential temple of Kossuth in Thay —if not all of Faerûn —until the mid-to-late 14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Klanak Famouth was a man consumed by rage and an acute awareness of his own mortality, especially in his advanced age.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He was a powerful divine spellcaster who was capable of incantations that could completely negate the damaging properties of fire .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Klanak was the chief mentor of Mythalanir , who would go on to become the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier in Bezantur . However, this relationship evolved into that of an archrivalry and eventually into murderous hostility.</p>
<p>He was an ally of convenience with Mythrell'aa , the Red Wizard Zulkir of Illusion .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Prior to his appointment as Eternal Flame over the Burning House, Klanak was already an old man who had been the priest in charge of overseeing the temple's slaves . He served as the leader and high priest of the Burning House for decades, and as of 1357 DR , he was the highest-ranking Kossuthan priest in Thay and arguably the most important in all of the Realms. However, his temple burned down sometime shortly before 1370 DR , leading his former subordinate and protégé, Mythalanir, to usurp his role as the most prominent member of the Kossuthan faith.</p>
<p>Klanak suspected that Mythalanir had orchestrated the destruction of the Burning House, and so swore revenge. To achieve this, he abandoned the rebuilding of his temple to his junior subordinates and allied himself with Mythrell'aa, an enemy of Mythalanir's ally, Aznar Thrul . The pair hatched a plot to manipulate adventurers into bypassing the many defenses of the FLaming Brazier and slaying Mythalanir.</p>
