<p>Malavon Despana was a powerful drow wizard who served as the Archmage of the Underdark city of Rilauven in the late 13 th and early 14 th centuries DR .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among his many possessions, Malavon owned a deadly dagger called Fire Kiss , which he purchased from the notorious drow merchant, Nym . He also wore the Robe of the Watcher , gifted to him for being the most talented practitioner of divination magic in Rilauven.</p>
<p>He owned many magic scrolls and items, some of which he would sell.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Malavon often dwelt in lower Dorn's Deep , in his subterranean laboratory, which was protected by two iron golems . He oversaw several svirfneblin miner slaves, and did not hesitate in killing them if he deemed it necessary.</p>
<p>He led a group of anti- Lolthite revolutionaries to a successful coup in Rilauven, changing the Lolth-venerating, matriarchal society into a relatively egalitarian oligarchy, led by a council of representatives from the city's academies. The coup was relatively bloodless. He made this happen with the help of the Masked Traitors, who worked against their own houses, such as Viizra Arabani . Malavon then appeared to be the most powerful being in the city, which was rare, as in most drow societies males were generally considered to be inferior to females.</p>
<p>He oversaw the House Despana camp known as Ahk Kyorl Kulgg , which was near a location where his allies were turned into driders . Here, he told an adventuring party that his sister, Ginafae Despana , had also been turned into a drider and led a group of them allied with the Severed Hand . He knew about the Viciscamera , the device that turned drow into driders, and wished to destroy it. After it was destroyed by an adventuring group, his sister returned to Ahk Kyorl Kulgg, and he transformed her back to a drow.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Malavon was a powerful mage, having created at least one spell himself: Malavon's rage , which was a destructive spell of some potency. His sister also noted that he was a skilled diviner, and was capable enough with other forms of magic to wipe out an entire cavern of driders.</p>
