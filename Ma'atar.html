<p>Ma'atar was an artificially created, Zhentarim -controlled oasis located in the Anauroch desert.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Ma'atar housed a number of stone structures that served as fortified barracks, beneath which were tunnels that stored an arsenal of supplies, weapons, and magical armaments.</p>
<p>It was said to be a bountiful oasis that was rich with vegetation including nut-producing trees, and its underground tunnels harbored a small mushroom farm containing fine frill-collars that were used for Zhent alchemy .</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The isolated outpost was located on the western stretch of the Sword , west of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountains, possibly along the Black Road . [ speculation ]</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>It was protected by a stone wall that was manned by Zhentilar soldiers.</p>
<h2>Inhabitants</h2>
<p>As of the midâ€“14 th century DR , the settlement had a meager contingent of sixteen Zhentilar troops, served by three priests and led by a sole Zhentarim wizard .</p>
<p>The Zhentarim collected a large reserve of weapons and skeletons in the garrison of Ma'atar, the latter of which were animated into a small horde of undead to serve under their command.</p>
