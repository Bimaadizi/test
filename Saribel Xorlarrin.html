<p>In the Year of the Awakened Sleepers, 1484 DR , she accompanied Tiago Baenre to Clan Battlehammer in Icewind Dale in an assault that left many dwarves dead and others enslaved. That same year, she married Tiago, also making her part of the restored House Do'Urden . She took his family name, despite it being against drow custom, because Tiago and House Baenre were more powerful than her own house. After her marriage, she led orc forces against the town of Nesmé . When the orc forces overtook Nesmé, Tiago and Saribel became the "Duke and Duchess of Nesmé."</p>
