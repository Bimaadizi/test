<p>Beliarge was a Zhentarim mage of the mid-14 th century DR .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>At the time of his death, he wore a dark robe and many rings. He often sported a cruel smile.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>To Fzoul Chembryl , Beliarge was ambitious and capable enough to be a threat. To foes at a disadvantage, he acted courteous but arrogant.</p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>He knew a spell of paralyzation that was powerful enough to hold even Storm Silverhand , and which would not be affected by anything he did, even if he ran her through in plain view.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In late 1357 DR , Fzoul Chembryl sent Beliarge to attack Tessaril's Tower and capture Shandril Shessair after the destruction of Iliph Thraun , urging him to attack while her spellfire was depleted. He materialized in the location shortly afterwards, striking Tessaril Winter and Storm Silverhand with a paralyzing spell of his own devising, powerful enough to hold the two of them; Shandril instead escaped into the Hidden House of Eveningstar . There, she ambushed him with a sword, managing to get a decisive kill before he could react.</p>
