He believed the streets were plagued with thieves, bandits, murderers, and even " night assassins ", and that the people gave free passage to outlaws from Shou Lung and T'u Lung . It was rumored the people worshiped "the frog and the snake ". The agents of Lady Holang of Pim Tung operated here around Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR) .</p>
