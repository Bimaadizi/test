<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p>Barrowin was born in the area of the Great Rift , and she managed her family's business holdings in Ironmaster near Icewind Dale . She spent fifteen years there on assignment in Ironstar . Her life was not exciting enough for her, so she asked her family for relocation. When that request went unheard, she called on her deity to provide a new path.</p>
<p>Gorm answered indirectly. Barrowin found a new life, by falling in love with Storn Skulldark , a wealthy young Ironstar dwarf. Barrowin and Storn set out from Ironstar to build a fortress along the route from Neverwinter to Icewind Dale, within the Spine of the World mountain range.</p>
<p>The project had many setbacks, chief of which was the sudden disappearance of Storn Skulldark's fortune in Ironmaster . Storn traveled back without Barrowin to find his missing gold. During his journey he was attacked and carried off by a white dragon . His fate was unknown. Barrowin was devastated by this loss. She left Ironmaster, and joined the Order of the Gauntlet .</p>
<h3>Tyranny of Dragons</h3>
<p>Some time in the 1480s DR, Barrowin served as the Order of the Gauntlet's representative on a mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon from retrieving the Red Dragon Mask . Along with her new companions, Alaeros Margaster and Nymmestra Durothil , Barrowin traveled from Neverwinter back to Icewind Dale to stop the Cult. There the trio picked up two more allies, Ratshadow and Talon Everhale , and found out the cult had uncovered a stone-arch portal that granted them passageway to the isle of Tuern . Eventually, Barrowin and her four allies acquired full knowledge about the Cult of the Dragon's ultimate plan.</p>
<p>While on Tuern, Barrowin and her allies ventured into the Flame Fault and slew Lostmauth , one of the isle's three red dragon overlords. Their efforts were in vain however, as the cult's leader Severin Silrajin acquired the Red Dragon Mask and fled back to Neverwinter.</p>
<p>While they were stranded for a short while, eventually the group made it back to Neverwinter. While there, Ratshadow managed to steal the White Dragon Mask from the dragon cultists, and stashed it at Ulbrinter Villa in Waterdeep for his Zhentarim masters. Barrowin and her three remaining allies followed the trail of the cult to Waterdeep, but arrived at the Waterdhavian manor too late to save its noble lord . They did however find Varramzord , one of the cult's wyrmspeakers , and learned that Severin had completed the Mask of the Dragon Queen and was ready to summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells .</p>
<p>Barrowin and her fellow adventurers joined the allied forces of the Sword Coast in a great battle against the Cult of the Dragon at the Well of Dragons . While Tiamat briefly appeared on Faer√ªn from the depths of the Nine Hells, she was quickly defeated.</p>
