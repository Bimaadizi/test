<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR , the people of Hlondeth in the Vilhon Reach requested that the Graycloak's Wolves adventuring company deliver the Tome of Torment —the holiest book of the church of Ilmater —to Master Sufferer Olbedan at the House of the Harmed in Aralent. However, during the harsh winter, Graycloak's Wolves fell prey to doppelgangers and leucrotta preying on travellers and never made it to Olbedan. The Tome was thought lost in the winter snows.</p>
