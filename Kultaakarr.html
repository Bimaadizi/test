<p>Kultaakarr , also called the Throne of the Titan Lords , was a realm of giants in the Cold Lands founded in the 15 th century DR.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The realm was located in northern Vaasa . It was bordered to the north by the Great Glacier and the Surykyk Range mountains, and to the south by the Lugsaas Chain mountains. It encompassed the Sea of Frozen Tears .</p>
<h2>Government</h2>
<p>Kultaakarr was ruled by titan lords from their provisional capital of Baunilorotha on the northern coast of the Sea of Frozen Tears.</p>
<h2>Defenses</h2>
<p>In the late 15 th century DR, the titans had begun raising an army that had the potential to destabilize the region. Their frost giant warriors and berserkers favored greataxes while their spellcasters favored flails and ice magic , and could summon mighty frost titans .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the distant past, Kultaakarr was a subkingdom of Ostoria and was lost beneath the ice with the advance of the Great Glacier around −2550 DR . Once the Glacier began to retreat after 1038 DR , giants began returning to the region in increasing numbers. This accelerated after the death of the Ice Queen Iyraclea in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR , and by the late 15 th century DR, the ruins of Baunilorotha had been excavated and the realm had been reclaimed by the giants and their titan lords. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa also claimed the region at this time.</p>
<p>From Kultaakarr, frost giants explored the Great Glacier and sought the ruins of Iyraclea’s palace . In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , a band of Auril -worshiping frost giants were called to these ruins by a Zhengyian artifact , and slew a band of Banite Warlock Knights who were likewise seeking this artifact.</p>
<p>Tensions remained between the Warlock Knights and Kultaakarr, although this had yet to escalate into war as of the Year of Deep Water Drifting, 1480 DR . By this time, the titans were also opposed by the gold dragon Tamarand , the King of Justice .</p>
<p>A decade or so later, Annam All-Father broke the Ordning , thus throwing the hierarchies of all giant communities in Faerûn into chaos.</p>
