<p>Sneel was a lesser deity of rats that was worshiped on Toril by beast cults .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In the 14 th century DR , a beast cult existed in the sewers of Waterdeep that venerated Sneel and whose members deliberately allowed themselves to be afflicted with the wererat form of lycanthropy . Sometime in the late 1350's DR, after the 15 th of Mirtul , a cleric of the cult by the name of Pravus Muridae used a tanystropheus that had escaped into the sewers to lure out those seeking to claim the bounties placed on the dinosaur . He would rob the adventurers and bounty hunters lured out, then use their bodies as either food for his fellow wererats or sacrifices to Sneel.</p>
<p>By the 15 th century DR, this cult still remained and was secretly popular in the city's Dock Ward .</p>
<h2>Worshipers</h2>
<p>Sneel was primarily worshiped by intelligent rats, though some humanoids also showed it reverence, including wererats.</p>
