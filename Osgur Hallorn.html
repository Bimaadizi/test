<p>Osgur Hallorn , better known as the Fetcher , was the Guild Kingpin a district in the Upper City of Baldur's Gate during the late 15 th century DR . He kept his office within the city's Undercellar , hidden beyond secret tunnels and the inter-connected cellars of a dozen buildings he owned throughout the Gate.</p>
<p>He ran a network of informants comprising orphans and urchins, Fetcher's Brats , who hurried across the city in gangs, acting as spies and thieves. The Fetcher considered himself a wholly respected and influential man and valued the fact that he was up to date with Baldurian current events.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Despite his profession, he was typically a kind man. His ruthless nature only showed itself when it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Fetcher was rather large to the point of obesity. His imposing size, hooked nose, and mustache gave him a appearance not unlike a walrus. He had broad shoulders and a bulging stomach that contributed to his outwardly jovial demeanor. While most of it was hidden beneath scraggly hair, he had a large burn scar that covered part of his scalp.</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>Among the Fetcher's possessions a was walking stick that was capable of firing darts at the press of a button.</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>He kept a clowder of a dozen or so cats in his office. They would pounce upon anyone who was brazen enough to display ill-intent within his place of business.</p>
<p>The entrance to his lair in the Undercellar was hidden beyond a secret tunnel that rested under the Gate's Old Wall. Its exact location was only known to a select few of his agents, the guildmaster Nine-Fingers and, unbeknownst to the Fetcher himself, his fellow Kingpin and contemporary Rilsa Rael .</p>
<p>He was on rather familiar terms with Krydle , a member of the adventuring party that once saved Baldur's Gate from a red dragon .</p>
<p>When the Guild faced a dangerous upstart crime lord Stone Lord , secretly allied with the Cult of the Absolute , the new kingpin gradually attacked and took territory. By the time the Absolute crisis of the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR was raging in the Gate, Osgur Hallorn was thought to be one of the casualties of the war against Stone Lord. Even though his fate remained unknown, Fetcher's Brats, including Li'l Fezmor and Happy Hands , were taken under the Guild's wing, safe in the Guildhall, of the Lower City .</p>
