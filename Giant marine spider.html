<p>The giant marine spider was a rare species of monstrous spider adapted to living in aquatic environments.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These spiders came in a variety of sizes, but tended to be smaller than ordinary monstrous spiders, with the common size being around 8 feet (2.4 meters).</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>Hunting parties of these spiders consisted of up to half a dozen members, working together to swarm and bring down their prey. When hunting, they would hide in vegetation like seaweed until a creature came close, when they would pounce, rushing forward and attempting to paralyze the victim with their highly venomous bite.</p>
<h2>Ecology</h2>
<p>Giant marine spiders built their huge nests from a mixture of webbing and local vegetation underneath the surface of the water. These were filled with air allowing the spiders to breathe while hiding away from most predators. Captured prey would be taken into these lairs to be cocooned and devoured at leisure.</p>
<h3>Habitats</h3>
<p>These creatures were known to only inhabit saltwater locales, especially the shallow seas in tropical regions where vegetation was plentiful. These creatures were known to be found in the warmer parts of the ocean off Kara-Tur .</p>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>A giant marine spider could be summoned with the Summon monster V spell if the caster were in a saltwater aquatic environment. Sea focused spellcasters could summon up to 2 giant marine spiders with the same spell.</p>
