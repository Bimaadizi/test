<p>Son-liin was a stormsoul genasi of Akanûl in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>She grew up with her father in the wilds of Akanûl.</p>
<p>In the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR , she was very young, just barely a teenager, when Aoth Fezim took her along on the Brotherhood of the Griffon 's expedition to kill the gray dragon Vairshekellabex . She was the force's primary scout because she knew the land so well. While on the expedition, she was charmed by Yemere , a steel dragon disguised as a genasi . Yemere forced Son-liin to take the expedition through a canyon that was infected by Spellplague and caused her to shoot an orc during a parlay, touching off a brief battle. The charm was broken when Gaedynn Ulraes and Aoth killed Yemere.</p>
<p>After her time fighting for Aoth, she asked to join the Brotherhood and was accepted for membership although she was told it would be many years before she was given a griffon .</p>
<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gaedynn became a mentor of sorts to Son-liin, watching her back and teaching her battle techniques. Their close association caused her to develop a crush on Gaedynn, although it was unsure whether he shared her feelings or not.</p>
