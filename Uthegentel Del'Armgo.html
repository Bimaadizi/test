<p>Uthegentel Del'Armgo was the drow house weapon master of Barrison Del'Armgo .</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It was often said Uthegentel was the largest drow ever since he stood at over 6 ft (1.83 m) tall and weighed around 200 lb (90.72 kg). Uthegentel had short spiky white hair which was gelled with cooked rothe udders. Through his nose was a mithril ring and he had gold pins stuck through his cheeks. Most think Uthegental was never full blooded, because of his height and abnormally large build for a drow elf. Uthegental was a rival to Dantrag Baenre , weapon master to House Baenre until his death at the hands of Drizzt Do'Urden . At this time, Uthegentel was considered the greatest drow warrior in all of Menzoberranzan .</p>
<h2>Possessions</h2>
<p>His weapon of choice was a black trident +5 and he also used a magical net of entrapment . When battling foes, Uthegentel wore a suit of black plate mail +5 and often let them strike first just to prove that they could not harm him.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>In battle, Uthegentel was wild and would wipe red and yellow dye on his face, which could be seen with or without darkvision . Seemingly immune to pain and most mortal wounds, he possessed incredible savagery and was often reckless and impulsive.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>On Matron Baenre's campaign to Mithral Hall , he foolishly ventured into the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone alone to find it temporarily abandoned.</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>During the assault on Mithral Hall in 1358 DR , Uthegentel singlehandedly defeated Thibbledorf Pwent and his entire Gutbuster Brigade . After killing one dwarven member, Uthegentel was killed by a bite to the neck from Bidderdoo Harpell .</p>
