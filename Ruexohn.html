<p>Ruexohn was an incubus agent of the demon lord Graz'zt in Hillsfar in the late 15 th century DR .</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Circa 1486 DR , Ruexohn killed and replaced Davon Malaeda , the closest advisor of First Lord Torin Nomerthal . Using his new identity, Ruexohn influenced the First Lord's decisions. He also introduced Nomerthal to his "twin sister" Thessaly Malaeda , just arrived in the city—a succubus and fellow agent of Graz'zt.</p>
<p>Thessaly seduced Nomerthal and Ruexohn convinced him that he needed to marry her. So the First Lord organized the Midsummer Masquerade ball in order to announce his marriage to all the wealthiest citizens of Hillsfar. As planned, at this point, an elf assassin (in truth, a fiendish doppelganger ) ruined the announcement by striking Thessaly. Ruexohn and Thessaly made to escape but an adventuring party hired by Elanil Elassidil to gather intelligence about Hillsfar unveiled them and fought and killed them.</p>
<p>However, Ruexohn was quickly replaced by another incubus also posing as Davon.</p>
